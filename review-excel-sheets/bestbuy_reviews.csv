161,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Can REALLY make a difference,"Purchased this for my Dad, who was really pleased with how well it helped him ""stay full engaged"" with all that was going on around him in the room. Previously, he would try his best to navigate difficult hearing environments, but it was clear he would constantly be trying to keep up with conversations. Now, the quick-witted guy who raised me seems to be ""back"". THANKS!"
161,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Loud Enough but not Crisp,"Sound is loud enough however, the louder you set it the less clarity there is. Easy to charge, easy to adjust, comfortable fit. Pretty good quality for the price. I would recommend for someone who needs better hearing on a budget."
161,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Nice valuable hearing aids,"I have over 10 years of wearing hearing aids experience. This one looks nice so I gave it a shot, I am happy it does the job and it is only $300, comparable to my previous expensive device from insurance. Wearing is very comfortable and it is light, I can wear it all day long comfortablely and battery still lasts. Setup is smooth with the app but you don't necessarily need the app to make it work. I will recommend it for the value and performance."
161,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Great aids (hearing),"Well I purchased this product for my sister, who tried other hearing aids and couldn't get used to them, but with this product she was comfortable and very happy in less than 2 days.  So much so, she had me order this pair for our sister-in-law who was using a conventional pair of hearing aids that stopped working.  Don't have a report but she has had them for 4 days as of today."
161,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Works well & great value,We bought this for my grandmother who had moderate hearing loss. This works well for her because now she is able to follow & respond during conversations. We also appreciated the different sized domes to fit her smaller ears. These were easy to use right out of the box with understandable instructions. The only minor issue is that it whistles quite a bit (feedback) until the hearing aids are fitted securely in her ears. We didn’t have this issue with her $1800 hearing aid but this is completely tolerable considering the much lower price of these hearing aids. We returned the expensive version & will be keeping these.
161,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,pleased customer,"My daughter purchased these, and I love the clarity and quality of sound it provides me in assisting me to hear much better. This item was also on sale.  I would recommend to anyone.

I also like that they are rechargeble instead of using batteries. I just charge them overnight in the convenient charger / holder. They stay charged all day and if I take them out while mowing the lawn, I store them in the charger and put that in my pocket. It is convenient and safe."

Eargo's customer service is also first class, from the initial contact right after purchase to the on-going follow-up.  Attentive to the max, without being intrusive!
I'm a fan!"
9,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Helps a lot,Very pleased with these. I like that they aren't obvious to those around me. It really helps me hear my wife. I was concerned about wind noise when I drove my convertible. But that has turned out to be a non issue. I do wish they had Bluetooth streaming. But I understand that the technology is just not that small yet.
9,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Excellent Sonic Fidelity,"I have had my Eargo 7s for four weeks now. They are an upgrade from the Eargo 5s I bought a few years ago. They are the same tiny configuration and comfortable fitting with medical-grade silicone ""petals."" Those hold them gently inside your ear. 

The sound is the remarkable part, these tiny devices boost the sound frequencies needed to counteract your hearing loss. As such, the sound heard is natural and full frequency. All the bass and much of the mid-range frequencies can still sneak by the petals to be heard directly. 

Most of us with moderate hearing loss, have lost high-frequency response. So the Eargos fill that in. 

Even critical listening to music is a pleasure with the Eargo 7s. 

Are they worth the money? You bet they are. Just as I wouldn't be without my glasses, I won't be without my Eargos, they are a critical part of who I am since my hearing loss."

9,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Eargo Saves A Life,"As we age so unfortunately so do our parents. My father was having trouble hearing. We even thought he was not processing correctly because of the hearing issue.  The grandkids felt he was yelling at them. They often avoided talking to him. His great grandson loved him but ran when he spoke. I could see he was isolating himself. He was not having the same fun conversations with the family. I finally convinced him to go to Best Buy to purchase hearing aids.  When he saw how small the device was, he agreed to try them. I did the hearing test with him that prove to him he needed them. He put them on and now only takes them off to recharge them. He can have conversations! I just spoke to him on the phone and he was able to speak to me and understand everything I said. Before he got the eargo... he had his phone so loud his neighbors could hear the speaker and he could not. I see it has even improved his driving made him more aware. His processing has improved because he now understands what we are saying. I wish he had purchased eargo  years ago. What a BIG difference a small device CAN HAVE! It gave him back quality of life. I also have never dealt with a company that has such helpful support. It is a pleasure to speak with representatives who speak English and fully know their product."
9,BestBuy,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,poor battery performance and customer service,"I purchased the Eargo 7 in February 2023.  I was excited to get this new technology.  It had positive reviews and I really liked how it was designed.  I did not receive my order and contacted customer services and they checked the tracking of the first set, they could not confirm it had been delivered.   They promptly sent another set.  In a few days, I actually received two sets.  I could have kept the first set, but that would not have been cool.  I informed Eargo I would be sending one set back.
The Eargo 7 was easy to set up and comfortable.  I liked how it was near invisible, water resistant, and does not interfere with wearing glasses.  My previous hearing aid of Kirkland, over the ear and I had been wearing them for about three years.   
After about 8 months, the left Eargo 7 rechargeable battery would run out after about 13 hours of wear.   Around 9 months it was down to 12 hours.   I contacted customer service and they had me do a two step process of cleaning and rebooting my charger.   That seemed to help, but it was still around 12 to 12 ½ hours.  After informing Lisa, Customer Care Coordinator, she ordered a replacement for my left Eargo 7.  
The new left lasted all day, but now my right Eargo, was lasting about 14 hours.  In January 2024, 11 months after purchase, the right side was now about 13 to 13 ½ hours.  I contacted customer service again and Rick, Senior Personal Hearing Professional, advised me to go through the same two step process of cleaning and rebooting the charger.   As before this really did not help.  I contacted Rick via email and let him know the situation.  He informed me 12 to 16 hours a day is fine and the hearing aid is performing as it should.  I wrote back telling him that it was not acceptable.  I rely on my hearing aids all day.   13 hours is not a full day.   With only 13 hours, I needed to plan my day if I was going out at night.  If I was, I had to recharge my Eargo 7 in the middle of the day.  I told Rick, that hearing aids were like my glasses.  I cannot forgo not using my glasses for the last 3 hours of the day. I was upset and wanted my money back.  These hearing aids were not useful for me.   AND this is what Rick wrote back. Unfortunately returning them and getting a refund at this time is no longer an option. You're welcome to spend $5,000 to $7,000 on a pair of hearing aids with a battery that lasts longer than ours. 12-16 hours a day is all ours are rated for. The very best I can offer is to send you a replacement in hopes the battery lasts a little longer throughout the day. That is the very best I can do. How would you like me to proceed?
What kind of snarky answer is this?  I have requested a replacement, and hope it lasts until the end of the year.  After that I will not be buying any Eargo product."

9,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,My Better Hearing Journey,"My recent 5-10 year memory was always asking my family to turn up the TV volume or asking them to repeat what they said or to start annunciating or projecting their words.  Repeated heeds to get my hearing checked fell on deaf ears.  As a project engineer in the expanding biotechnology industry, I found myself having daily Face-To-Face project team and staff meetings.  Soon I developed the strategy to arrive to the conference room early, stand, and when the most soft-spoken person arrived, then I would sit opposite them.  Soon I realized that this strategy didn’t always work well as sometimes meetings would involve multiple others who never learned to project their voices when speaking?  My company HR Department had invited a local audiologist from Hearing Life on site for people to sign up for hearing screenings.  I was invited to the office for a more comprehensive examination.  Functionally the hearing devices made a big difference in my ability to hear and comprehend conversation. However, my holdback was that all they offered was over the ear devices.  I have short grey hair, wear glasses, and a mask when I work in our cleanrooms.  The average age of our workforce is 35, and I wasn’t ready to begin fighting the ageism battle yet.  I then realized my need, but as an engineer, I decided to look for better technology.  I then received a mailer from Miracle Ear for an inside the ear canal device.  I made an appointment, had another exam and then was told that I would not qualify for an inner canal device, because it was not programable and only served as an amplifier.   I felt that this had only been a “Bait and Switch” to get me into the office?  They also offered a device that fit into the ear canal, and was molded to the outer ear, but stuck out of the ear like a cancerous growth.  I then tried Starkey Manufacturing, but their inner ear canal devices were only battery powered and I was told that I would need to change out the battery weekly.  I was determined to keep looking.  
Then I either received a postcard, an email, or saw an ad somewhere from EARGO touting their Neo HiFi hearing devices.  I ordered some dummy devices to try them on for fit.  I tried them on for size and wore them for weekend days at a time (in spite of having no electronics nor hearing benefit) to determine how my ears would adapt.  This was the best I found in my better hearing search, if the actual functioning devices provided any hearing benefit?  There was a 30 or 60 day return policy, so I figured that I’d have nothing to lose?  I ordered my devices, and they came within the week.  I charged them up and first tried them over the next weekend.  Immediately I could hear my steps shuffling across the floor and the doorknob clank as I went outside.  It was spring on Cape Cod and I could not believe it?  For the first time in 5 years since moving to the Cape, I heard the birds chirping.
I continued to use my EARGO Neo HiFis for the next three years without incident.  I personally produce a lot of ear wax and oil, so I developed a nightly cleaning routine that went above and beyond EARGO’s cleaning recommendations.  Every night I would use a damp (not dripping wet) Q-Tip moist with 70% rubbing alcohol and wiped down all 16 electrodes on each device and charger to insure the best contact between the hearing aids and the charger.  Even this thorough cleaning did not always ensure immediate charging success.  So I would brush, wipe, and Q-Tip clean with alcohol again.  I learned that if my devices were not adequately charged over the night, they were useless the next day.
I received a postcard advertising the newest generation EARGO7 devices.  As soon as I saw inductance charging, I knew that alone would save me 5-10 minutes a night in my cleaning routine.  I have been using my latest generation for EARGO7 hearing devices for 2 weeks now and I love them:  The induction charging, the finger taps to change the hearing programs (compared to the hand taps with the Neo HiFi devices), the enhanced functionality of the EARGO7 cell phone app, and the On-The-Go personal customization of the devices.  The EARGO7 devices are more functional than I ever imagined.  Eventually when technology catches up, I hope that EARGO can introduce WiFI to the hearing devices; but for the present time they still provide the best value on the market.
I especially like driving with the windows down during springtime on the Cape.  Now without fear of the program of my left ear device repeatability changing, as it had with my Neo HiFi devices.  I must also add that the new EARGO hearing test Sound Match is way more thorough than any hearing test that I ever had in the audiologist’s office.  The only thing it is missing is a soundproof booth.  Compared with the technology offered by other players in the hearing device industry, EARGO is hands down the best. Their devices are the most concealed (no one knows that I wear hearing aids, but my family and others I know that struggle with hearing loss and I have shared my EARGO experience with).  EARGO 7 devices are the most functional and programmable and are 2-3 times lower cost of others in the hearing device industry."

Once I started using them I was amassed at how my hearing improved, These deliver a natural sound without the tinny sound other units I had tried. I've been using these for about 5 weeks and now forget they are even in my ears. Great sounding, comfortable, and the preset programs work well for me. Especially like the fact that loud environments do not blast you ears. These devices have restored my hearing back to what I consider normal. They also provide excellent training with an Eargo rep (via phone ) which helps to get you started. Thanks Eargo!"

9,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Excellent Hearing Aids!,"I am extremely satisfied with my Eargo 7 hearing aids! I find them to be highly effective.  It’s a relief to be able to hear people speaking without thinking that they’re mumbling, and outdoors, the sound of birds singing is delightful.

I have to say that I am a bit vain.  I know that I have been suffering from hearing loss for several years now, but I have been stubborn, I didn’t want to get behind-the-ear hearing aids.  Whenever I see someone wearing hearing aids, my first thought is, “that person is old, that’s not for me”.  The beauty of my Eargo 7 hearing aids is that they are truly invisible.  I don’t feel self-conscious using them.  I put them in my ears first thing in the morning and leave them in all day.  They’re comfortable and most of the time I even forget that they’re in my ears.

The Eargo company has provided excellent service.  I have had a couple of questions regarding the best settings for different situations.  Within a day, an audiologist has returned my call.  The app on my phone is easy to use.  I always carry my phone with me anyway, so if the need arises, I can easily change the settings.

In conclusion, my Eargo 7s are a great product.  They are effective, and they have improved the quality of my life.  I feel that they are well worth the cost, and I highly recommend them."
9,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Works as advertised.,"Hello,

I purchased the eargo 7.

So far it has been a very pleasant experience; the unit works as advertised and the customer support has been top notch. Coming from a CIC unit from Starkey, I find that there is no occlusion effect with the eargo, and the eargo just fits better. I think the best feature is that it is completely invisible, this is key for me since I'm still working. 

The unit has an applesque feel/opration to it, but not quite there. The charging pod works ok, but it is finicky to charge, if you happen to not have the removal string perfectly inside it - it also scratches very easily. Would like to see the cleaning brush neatly packaged inside the unit.

Overall, the hearing aid performance has been very good, the app works fine when switching between programs. I'm better able to follow along in meetings, and I have noticed that I'm not asking people to repeat themselves. It took me a while for the itching sensation to go away, but I do not have that issue anymore.

I'm still playing with the various programs to find the one that gives me the best clarity for noisy/crowded situations, it works very well, but I think it is just a question about performing small tweaks to the volume and noise filters to make it even better.

I would love to see a bluetooth edition. I test drove an over the ear unit from Starkey, the Genesis AI. It worked great. I loved being able to pick up phone calls seamlessly. It also had many ""gadget"" features like adjusting to the environment by pressing a button. I know the eargos do this automatically, but the Starkey units just seem to do it much better. But the biggest no no for me was that they were not invisible, and they wanted over $6k for them, this is a non-starter for me.

I know that packaging a battery plus electronics into a unit that needs to fit a tiny ear canal is a challenge, but I would be willing to give up on how long the battery lasts in order to get the BT capability. I would be willing to buy a hearing set that has two hearing aids that can be swapped when one is discharged...very interesting, seems like a product field for Apple to get into. How cool would that be? Hearing aid/phone/apple watch interaction, analytics, etc.

I appreciate how you are disrupting the hearing aid model.I think the current doctor and manufacturer relationship is pure bull crap; it artificially doubles or triples the cost of a product that shouldn't cost more than an iphone. IMO.

Overall, the unit has changed my life for the better."
9,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Eargo Review,"I'm about to pass my 45 day trial period with my Eargo set, first time hearing aid user.  I was drawn to the Eargo because of the small size and the inside the ear option vs a bulky behind the ear device.  I received the dummy set and was happy with the fit etc. so went ahead with the purchase.

 

The customer service is/was extraordinary all throughout the process.  I followed along with the suggested prompts and reminders etc. and everything couldn't have gone any smoother.  I am really happy with the result - I wear them almost every day with a few exceptions.  I mostly notice that I never have to ask people to repeat themselves - TV doesn't have to be turned up so loud and the sounds I hear in nature are fabulous.  I also notice a big difference in an office setting where there is a lot of ""white noise"" in the background. I was missing more than I realized.

 

One of the best parts of the Eargo product is the phone app customization and ease of moving through various settings - a double tap on the ear to reset is very cool.  I have the volume set on the lowest setting most of the time but anticipate that as the years go by, that might change.  I'm glad to have a device that can change with me.  Another great feature is the charger - no separate battery to fool with getting in/out of the unit.  I charge it at night as I do my cell phone and I'm done.  Cleaning is easy and I intend to follow the simple habit daily as suggested.

I highly recommend this product for anyone who is getting signals from their world that they need a little lift hearing conversation - TV, etc.  Bottom line - quality of life is better.

Thanks"
9,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,My Journy to better hearing,"I finally started the journey to address my hearing loss this year. I started with the big name brand thinking they were the best. Well, after two months, two different hearing aid models & countless office visits, they didn't help like they were supposed. They stated that these would significantly help my ""mild to moderate"" hearing loss. The occlusion was horrible in both ears and annoyed me hearing my own voice inside my head. I finally gave up on this big name brand and lucky for me they had a ""if your not happy after 60 days, they will refund your money"" which they actually did. I researched online and discovered the Eargo brand. I liked the size and how well they were concealed in my ears. I ordered the free trial pair which are just the shells to try in my ears and I was astonished how comfortable they were. I then took their online hearing test to ensure they would work for my type of hearing loss. I even got a personal call from an Eargo hearing professional to inform that I was a prime canidate for their devices. So, for half the price, I ordered my Eargo 7's. I received them very quickly and immediately got them set up. I started with their sound match thru their app for the phone. I was quick, simple and a smooth process. Once the update of the sound match was completed and updated to my hearing devices, a new world of sounds immerged. I was hearing better after the first sound match with the Eargo 7's than I did with two months of office visits with the other brands ""hearing specialist"" making adjustment after adjustment without any improvement. I am soooo Glad I chose to Eargo 7, not only am I hearing better, but Eargo's staff and customer service are the best and most professional I have ever dealt with!!! I would recommend these to anyone with mild to moderate hearing loss."

I wish it was possible to replace the battery, because as it stands I'm looking at buying a replacement set in about 3 years' time, but all things considered these are a miracle for the price.  My family didn't even know I was wearing them at first, they are almost invisible!  Also, their pre AND after-sales support is great too.  Buy with confidence."

They are top of the line high tech, virtually invisible and comfortable to wear.   By gently tapping my ear I can change the mode of these devices depending on whether I’m watching tv, sitting in a restaurant, talking on the phone or listening to the birds while raking autumn’s leaves.  Since they are virtually invisible and because I’m so impressed by them, I don’t hesitate to show them off to family, friends and new acquaintances and to make the purchase even sweeter, I’m dealing with a company that not only stands behind their product but they stand behind their customers 100%!

The quality of my hearing is better, the devices are easier to use (switching programs, volume, etc.) and the cleaning regime is more robust with better results.

She was excellent in walking me through the process. She explained the pros and limitations to the product. I had originally planned on getting a dummy set to test the fit but quickly came to the conclusion that was a waste of time given the return policy. I decided to purchase the product based on our conversation. She was clear, professional, and was able to relate the product features to my desires. In short, she created an experience that gave me great confidence in the product, the company, and service after I received the device
 
When I received the device, I had a conversation with an Eargo hearing specialist. She walked me through all of the details of using the device (petal choice, cleaning, what to expect as you begin to use the device, etc.). Again, another exceptional experience. My call with her was about 3-4 days after I had received the device so I had a good sense of how the device was working.
 
The device itself is very intuitive. It took me a couple of tries to get the cleaning process down. My routine now is that I clean the device every morning … takes about 5-7 minutes and I’m set for the day. I typically wear the device from about 5:30AM to 11:00PM.

I received them a couple of days later and used the app to set them up the way they worked best for me. They had a new setting called sound match. It gives you a little tone test to help get you tuned in to the best hearing for you. I then picked out the settings I wanted and it was the best experience of my life. My hearing was incredible in both ears. After a while Eargo had came out with the Eargo 7.I contacted a representative, asked alot of questions and he really helped me.

With the use of Eargos, I no longer have to say ""beg your pardon"", listen to the television so loud that my family complains, and hear things that I would not normally hear outside of my house.  I am now at the point where I can barely feel them. The best part is that they are small and hidden in my ears. No one knows I have them. 

They do require regular maintenance, but so far that has just become a part of my daily routine."
9,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Eargo 7's are great,"I am very pleased with my Eargo 7's.  The new ""putty cleaning"" method really helps.  Also, great customer service."
9,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Eargo 7 experience,"The EARGO 7 has been excellent so far.  I've used them for a month now and have experienced a vast improvement in sound quality and the ability of the 7's to adjust quickly to different sound environments.  I'm not experiencing the warble sounds I'd hear when turning on the microwave or opening the car door.  The EARGO app is a huge improvement with the addition of the sound adjust+ feature, which I use the emphasize speech option periodically when at meetings or noisy restaurants.   The sound quality of the 7's seems to be very close to what I was experiencing with my prior prescription CIC's.

A couple of other things to note:  
The EARGO customer support team has been fantastic.
The clinical team assisted me in setting up my EARGO's to match a prior hearing test that I had done by an audiologist which I thoroughly appreciated."
9,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Sherry,"I have just upgraded to EARGO 7 from my original purchase in 2020.  It is an excellent hearing aid product, tiny and powerful technology.  EARGO Customer Service is readily available and helpful with any issues.  I am most pleased with EARGO 7."
9,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,High Quality Product and Great Customer Service,The high quality of the product (Eargo 7) is matched by the great customer service at Eargo.  I'm 1.5 months into my first-ever hearing aids and am very pleased with this company.
9,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Best Hearing Aides,"Eargo 7 are the best hearing aides I have tried. The highest praise I can give them is that they have slipped seamlessly into my life. I hear significantly better. I no longer ask for things to be repeated. Today I forgot they were in my ears and I did not miss a word. I also have noticed that with the 7’s I don’t hear a distortion at the high ends or chirping at certain frequencies. I give the Eargo7’s a 5/5 stars and have recommended them to friends. 
 
They disappear into the ear so the self consciousness of looking old is gone."
9,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Performance and ease of operations make this a hit,"I have used Eargo Hearing Aids since they were first introduced and just a few weeks ago got my Eargo7, the latest and most advanced of their line. What a great product; honestly, the performance has increased as the technologies have. But beyond the enhanced hearing, the real time controls via my cell phone is terrific. I can now make instant adjustments for TV viewing or meetings or large family gatherings. I am pleased beyond my expectations."
9,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Outstanding products and people!,"Outstanding products. I started out in 2020 with the Eargo 5's to help with my mild to moderate hearing loss and tinnitus. Significantly improved my hearing and even reduced the tinnitus. I upgraded to the Eargo 7's, which have even more technology, in January 2024 and absolutely love them.

The Customer Service Department at Eargo is Fantastic! They have real people that really care. They go out of their way to answer questions, resolve issues or simply help you make adjustments or understand your hearing devices.

Great value compared to traditional hearing aids that may or may not work as well as Eargos! I have found them to be a first rate company with honest people who make a quality product. I highly recommend!"
9,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,I Can Hear Again!,"It took about a week to get used to the new Eargo7s. I have reduced hearing in the mid to upper frequency ranges and I also suffer from Tinnitus.  I've been to many ""specialists"" and all they can do is tell me I have to live with it or buy these ridiculously expensive hearing aids to ""mask"" the noise. We are talking about $7000. each.   Lately, I had tried the Nano brand because they were a gift from my wife.  But the Nano's did show me what an in-ear canal aid could do. Plus they were larger than the Eargo and NOT as clear or comfortable.   But for $300 a pair, they were much less expensive.   All others were external and interfered with my glasses, plus the battery changing nightmare.  My mother had big buck hearing aids. She was always changing batteries and they always had ""feedback.""  She was so deaf that she couldn't hear the noise, but everyone else did.
So, I researched it because I knew I needed something better than the Nano's.  So I returned them for refund.  I came across the Eargo's and researched them on U-tube and social media.   Even though these are expensive, I decided to give them a try and why NOT with the 45 day money-back offer.  YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!!!  It took a while to find a comfortable fit, but I settled on the medium open florets.  After 2 weeks of use, while using the factory settings, I did the hearing test.  Twice because the first attempt wasn't in a totally quiet environment.  THE SECOND WAS AT NIGHT WHEN EVERYONE WAS ASLEEP, IN A CLOSED ROOM.  Wow.  
Well, LET ME TELL YOU.!  These are fantastic.  I enjoy the different settings and filters for the different environments.  Plus the fact that these ACTUALLY DO LAST ALL DAY FOR UP TO 16 HOURS.  How do you get that much battery in such a tiny device? (You should partner with Samsung, so my phone would last.) LOL
Plus now that I've been wearing them every day, all day, I don't even notice them.  I actually have to reach up and make sure they are still there!   The charging case is also way cool.  How inventive!  I happy with my investment. 
So in closing I WILL get back to you down the road with updates.  Please keep up the GREAT WORK!"
9,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Huge hearing improvement and no one knows,"I upgraded from the Eargo 6 to the Eargo 7.  Both are excellent with the Eargo 7 giving additional noise reduction and additional controls for managing noise reduction.  

Why do I like them? 1) A huge improvement in ability to hear people talk to me.  This includes in meetings with quiet talkers, at noisy restaurants, and just in general day to day use. 2) They are quite comfortable after some adjustment and coaching from their expert during one of my 1:1 sessions (using the open petal instead of closed).  3) they are virtually invisible - only my wife and kids know I have them and maybe my barber.  This last point was a major factor for me choosing Eargo.  The two audiologists I saw immediately went to the behind the ear variety because they say it has more capabilities and is easier to fit.  The fact that they are visible was a non-starter.  I'm already amongst the oldest in my office and don't need to accentuate the fact.

Every YouTube videos and Eargo experts say it takes a month to adjust.  It was all of that.  Now I miss them if they are not in my ears and forget about them when they are.

Highly satisfied with the product and the support."
9,BestBuy,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,The charge dies very fast.,"As far as the ability to hear these are great, also very comfortable. Problem is they go dead so fast and so does the charging case. More times than not they are dead and useless to me. I will be returning them."
9,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Give these hearing aids a try!,"Have had my Eargo 7 for several weeks now and am so happy with my decision. They are small enough to be comfortable in my tiny ear canals, the sound match and app are easy to use and the customer support is amazing. This company is really there for the end user with very quick response time to questions and support needs. And the devices are almost invisible in the ears. No more asking for people to repeat themselves. Yay!"
9,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,My hearing  journey to the Eargo7,"The bottom line first - I am a happy Eargo customer and can honestly say that Eargo has consistently met and exceeded my expectations for the last 6 years.  I have received no compensation for this statement and have owned no less than 6 Eargo Devices.  What a blessing to be able to hear again - I didn’t know what I was missing!  Yes - there was a learning curve with some tinkering required but the fact is the capability is there for the taking.  I’m so glad I didn’t listen to some of the negative reviews I’ve encountered over time.  

Like a lot of folks I took my hearing for granted.  My loss of hearing didn’t happen overnight so it wasn’t one of those immediate pressing issues.  However after almost 30 years of hearing abuse in the military, my hearing had become greatly diminished.  My wife of over 3 decades was getting tired of having to repeat things during our conversations.  It was also becoming an issue for me as I served on several community councils and was the president of a college.  I know it was to a large extent my vanity … I didn’t want people to know I was hearing challenged by wearing this loop over my ears.  But finally, I had to do something about it.  

I did what most logical folks would do - I looked up a audiologist.  After my first visit, it became clear I had the hearing of a fire hydrant.  It was quite the journey, and I still remember the sticker shock to get a hearing aid.  By the time we would be done, it would be around $10,000.  I could hardly believe it.  So to get to the point on this piece of history … I was fitted for a hearing aid, went through training on maintenance and use.  While the folks were amazing people, I grew weary of the constant trips for checks and tuneups.  And batteries … they were everywhere and never where I needed them.  I finally lost my patience and quit.  There just had to be a better way!

Years passed, and my wife who hadn’t given up on me found this article in a veterans magazine.  (Rabbit trail here - Eargo has always gone out of their way to support veterans and their veterans discount makes a huge difference for those who have lost hearing).  The article talked about a new technology that did not require battery replacements, and the system could be obtained online … and could even use your current audiologist data to tune your system.  

I immediately pursued getting a set, but was told that they could not sell to residents of Washington or Oregon! What??? So I checked around and was told that Eargo was a “fast buck” business and would not be allowed to sell in Oregon and Washington.  Not to be deterred …  this made me even more curious, and I spent a lot of time in research and reading.  I discovered this whole world of hearing amplifiers … but they just made the sound louder and for me they were useless.  The more I read, the more I was convinced that I wanted to give the Eargo innovation a try.  I had the “trial fit” system mailed to a friend in Arizona.  I tried on the set, and they felt natural from day one.  I was about ready to order a real functional Eargo System when they became legal to buy over the internet for Oregon and Washington.  

I moved quickly to become a member of the Eargo Family and I’ve been a member since.  I am still in contact with my first customer representative.  Clearly, I was more than a quick sale and goodbye. Over the years, I’ve even purchased “used” systems to replace the the units that I’ve destroyed.  The fact is the Eargo unit is so comfortable that it’s very easy to forget that you’re wearing them.  I’m not proud of the fact that I broke a number of them by going swimming or taking a shower with them still in my ears.  They didn’t survive.  So when the WATER-RESISTANT Eargo6 came on the market (a technology innovation), I was quick to get a set.  As recently as last night, I forgot they were in my ears and went to bed.   Anyway … I recently told someone at Eargo that I’m so sorry … but I’m saving a $bundle by not having to chase down used Eargo units and replacement parts on EBay (a good quality indicator that people sell and purchase upgraded systems).  But I digress … it was time for me to step up and get the Eargo6.

I just absolutely love my Eargo6 system and the support team that comes with them.  However as a cautionary note, I knew going forward that I had to make sure that I had the correct smart phone technology and that I had a handle on my expectations.  I purchased a hearing aid and so understood that it’s focus is on supporting hearing activity in a seamless fashion.  In my humble opinion and experience, if we add too many expectations to technology … we are setting ourselves up for disappointment.  Therefore, I don’t miss the fact that I can’t direct stream Bluetooth to these devices for music, noise canceling and phone calls.  There are other systems designed to do that … so I don’t mind.  If someday Eargo offerers the capability … I’d be thrilled as long as I don’t lose what I consider to be the critical 3:  1-seamless comfort(every earbud I own gets uncomfortable at some point); 2-LONG battery life … I put them in at 7am and take them out at 11pm … amazing; 3-quick charge case is not only protective … it can quickly charge up or top off your Eargo systems on the fly - NO BATTERIES OR WIRES.  

As another rabbit trail … if I were to add a forth critical feature it would be cost to benefit ratio.  Yes - I’ve seen the reviews that have said Eargo is expensive for an OTC device … but then I don’t think these reviewers have ever had to shell out 6 to 10 grand for a hearing aid system.  Eargo is an amazing deal for the level of restored hearing I have received.   Anyway … if Eargo were to add Bluetooth features - they might not be able to compete in the OTC market.  One of my sons recently gave me a tour of his new Bluetooth noise canceling earbuds which were in the $300 dollar range - not only were they big outside the ear canal devices … this kind of cost impact might drive people to other options.  Again - the Eargo is not a noise amplifier … it really is focused on hearing which is a whole different world.  

In addition to the Eargo6 hardware, I’ve come to really like the software.  The focus of the Eargo system and the Eargo Hearing Team is to help a person reach a level of hearing that is so natural and transparent that we forget that it’s there.  I like that I can  take multiple hearing tests through their Sound Match Technology and tune the software to my personal needs and expectations.  Once “tuned” an individual can quickly switch hearing profiles and adjust volume and noise filtering on the fly.  So no matter what my environment, I can adjust the system to maximize my hearing.  Best yet … it’s all invisible.  Most of the time, just leaving it in “normal” is good enough.  I think the only time I fiddle with the settings is when I’m watching a movie and want to maximize my hearing without bothering those around me.

Finally … I’ve mentioned it multiple times before but comfort has always been the Eargo win for me.  When I first tried hearing aids, I had great difficulty getting past the “itchy” feeling.  With Eargo, it was never a problem.  In fact, I find myself sticking with the default medium closed petals which improve the amplification.  But the fact that Eargo provides the open petal design makes it easy for someone new to hearing aids to make the transition.  

Okay - I’ll stop here.  As I said at the beginning … I’m a satisfied customer and I’m looking forward to upgrading to the Eargo7 someday soon.  Recently, my Eargo6 had a software upgrade which essentially gave me Eargo7 functionality.  But it’s like having a Corvette engine (a guy thing) without the Corvette Body and hardware enhancements.  So I’m saving my funds in a cookie jar and will soon have the Eargo7 in its entirety.  

Thank you Eargo for the gift of hearing.  And thank you for all those amazing Eargo support team members that have helped me over the years via chat, email, and phone."
9,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Better Hearing,"My Eargo 7's are my first try at hearing aids.  I'm 74 and they really help me hear things much more clearly, especially speech!  I'm hearing things I have not really heard in years.  These things are really great!  I find the open petals work for me much better than the closed petals.  I have tried both the medium and large version of each style of petal.  For me the large open ones seem to work the best.  But even with the large petal size, I'm still having a minor issue where the the Eargo 7 devices very gradually slip further out of my ear.  They work great the whole time, until one of the devices will actually fall out.  So I've gotten into the habit of feeling for the position of the ball on the end of the removal thread, and if it seems to be working out, just pushing the device back in every now and then.  But even with that minor caveat, overall it is great to be able to hear better without having to have a larger device behind my ear in the same place where my glasses rest.
(Note: I've had my Eargo 7 devices for about a month now-- I purchased directly from Eargo)"
9,BestBuy,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Sold me refurbished ones.,I bought Eargo 7 thinking I had bought new ones but it turned out that mine were already registered to another man when I gave Eargo my serial number.  Also the app already had a saved file from someone else.  Will return and buy new ones from Eargo
9,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Excellent Product,"I am very pleased with my Eargo7s. I like that they are smaller and are a better fit for my ears as compared to my Eargo Neo.  I particularly like that I can make comfort adjustments from my phone. I chose to create and fine tune four programs of my choice. (TV, phone, restaurant, and normal)
I am testing the Sound Adjustment feature. I noticed an adjustment to a noisy ventilation fan in my bathroom. I also noticed a change when driving in a noisy situation. I learned that I do not get sound adjustment when I move from one room with tv on normal into another room where the tv is on much louder. However, a temporary comfort adjustment can be made through the app. 
I would like to say that Customer Service is very reliable. They contacted me through email, phone, and text in a timely manner. They answered my questions with clarity and assured me that they are always there to help.  
Again, I’m very pleased with my upgrade from Neo to Eargo7. I would buy again and my husband is also considering a purchase for himself."
9,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Graet hearing aid,"About 5 years ago, I decided to purchase the earlier version of the Eargo hearing aid. I did so for simple reasons for me. They are small and do not have the bulky appearance of an over-the-ear hearing aid.  I was drawn to this solution because they were less expensive than “regular” hearing aids and virtually invisible in the ear. Ease of use, reliability, and price swayed me. Over the following  years, these original Eargos began to lose their ability to recharge rendering them unusable. For that reason and the legal changes for hearing aids prompted me to investigate multiple options for replacement. After many searches, I went back to Eargo and compared prices, looks, effectiveness, and whether friendly usable. I found Eargo to have the best option for me as a hearing aid that is inconspicuous in the ear, easy to put in/take out and powerful enough to compensate for my age-related hearing loss. I chose to purchase the Eargo 7 because of those factors as well as being able to make any necessary adjustments with my smart phone. I am happy to enthusiastically recommend the Eargo option and especially the Eargo 7."
9,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Great for hearing when going out,"I have well not good hearing, but not terrible either. 

I use the aids when going out to hear conversations in restaurants and other venues, I now can go out to dinner at a dinner with a show venue I can hear my friends. 

These hearing aids are by far the best ones in terms of sound quality and background noise reduction. 

I like the different volume levels for different situations. Plus, they are amazingly comfortable. After a bit, I do not even notice them. Worth the investment for me. 

The small portable case also acts as charging base and it also helps carry and store the pieces safely, but the top comes off too easily and needs a small redesign to provide a latch to ensure the case does not open by mistake.
They are tiny, discreet, and comfortable. Best of all, they are effective.

I had doubts when I first received them and spent time talking to support staff to find out what I was doing wrong and better ways to work with the aids, the staff was incredibly supportive and helped me to achieve my desired hearing levels.
My left ear has a large canal that with the large petals works great, my right ear has a small canal, and the medium petals are still a bit too large and could use a smaller petal I believe.  

The iPhone application is easy to use, but I wished it gave status information, like battery levels, and other status items."
9,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Great device! Unbelievable Customer Service!,"I recently purchased my new Eargo7s.  Can't tell you what a great addition they've been to  my life.  I put them in my ears in the morning and hardly think about them until I take them out at night. And most importantly, my hearing is so improved...clear and crisp.  And, I'm blown away by their customer service.  When I was giving the Eargo7s a try, a real audiologist was always a phone call away to remotely help with any tiny adjustments I needed to make. Honestly, I can't speak highly enough about this great product and company."
9,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Surprising hearing assistance,"The Eargo 7 System is a dramatic improvement over the Neo HiFi, even though I liked the Neo model.  I was coming up on the 2 1/2 year mark, and noticed my natural hearing had diminished.  I saw the offer for an upgrade to the 7 unit, so went into the local Veritas/Verizon store and took a screening test to make sure I was still within the parameters of mild to moderate.  I then took another screening test at home where there was less ambient noise.  When the Eargo 7 System arrived and I set them up, I was astounded at the improvement, not only in hearing better, but I really liked the flexibility of the programing using my iPhone.  I’ve followed the entire dinner conversation of 8 people seated at a rectangular table, which was not possible before, and I can understand the nightly TV newscasters much better.  Kitchen timers and routine household noises are amplified stronger and much clearer than before."
9,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,So glad I bought these,"The Eargos checked all the right boxes for me. They're small, invisible, rechargeable hearing aids. I read all the reviews online and thought I'd take a shot with these. So glad that I did!"
9,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"Never say ""what?"" again!","I was somewhat skeptical about the claims made by Eargo. However, when I received them, all doubts disappeared. My hearing has improved drastically with a minimal amount of adjustment to having the devices in my ear.

And they are just about invisible, which is a huge plus. I highly recommend you give them a try, nothing to lose with a 30 day guarantee.

I am tempted to say the Eargo's have improved my hearing to the point where I can hear what other people are thinking, but that might be a bit of an exaggeration ;) 

As noted they are for mild to moderate hearing loss. If you're hearing loss as severe, these probably will not work for you.

The two cautions I will give you are that they do take a little time to adjust to both the feel of the devices in your ear canals, and, how your voice sounds to yourself. Within two weeks I hardly noticed them, if at all. Oh, and you do have to experiment with the different settings. I like to tinker and found this to be a huge plus rather than going back and forth to an audiologist office for adjustments. Everyone is different though, so be honest with yourself before purchasing.

The entire crew at Eargo have been awesome and I appreciate I have been assigned my own audiologist who has been very helpful and available by phone and by email.

So far, so good, I'll make updates as necessary and welcome any questions you may have. As someone who has worked in healthcare for over 40 years (as a dentist) I find it a privilege to help others. Good luck in your quest for better hearing!"
9,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,As Good or Better than more expensive hearing aids,"The moment I put them in I could hear a difference. Sounds, creaking floors, microwave chime now louder and listening to TV with volume at a lower number by about 7 pts. The 4 presets are noticeably different, but minimum due to my hearing loss. 
I've had them on in several restaurants and while they don't block out background noise for me yet, I do feel I was able to hear my girlfriend better, I still have hearing issues but I bought them before end of trial period, so I do believe they help."
9,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,3 month Review of EARGO 7 hearing aids,"I have mild-moderate hearing loss and wanted to try completely in the ear canal hearing aids. The previous pair I had was the more standard over the ear model. The Eargos are tiny, are easy to insert and fit relatively well in the canal, although they protrude out a bit. Sounds are well amplified, although I still have some trouble with conversations, even with tinkering with the different programs available. I still do not fully understand some words that people say during a conversation. The charger's profile is also compact and easily transportable in a purse. Cleaning and maintaining the aids is an easy nightly ritual. When purchasing the aids, I did not realize that there would be additional ongoing costs for the petals and the mic caps, which should be changed every 3 months. This is not stated in the promotional materials. The app. on the iPhone is very easy to navigate and use.  Customer service and follow-up by email and reminders is excellent. The short tutorial videos are also excellent - concise and clear in instructions. Overall I am happy with the Eargo 7s, even if I still have some ongoing hearing deficits."

Eargo's customer service is also first class, from the initial contact right after purchase to the on-going follow-up.  Attentive to the max, without being intrusive!
I'm a fan!"
9,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Helps a lot,Very pleased with these. I like that they aren't obvious to those around me. It really helps me hear my wife. I was concerned about wind noise when I drove my convertible. But that has turned out to be a non issue. I do wish they had Bluetooth streaming. But I understand that the technology is just not that small yet.
9,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Excellent Sonic Fidelity,"I have had my Eargo 7s for four weeks now. They are an upgrade from the Eargo 5s I bought a few years ago. They are the same tiny configuration and comfortable fitting with medical-grade silicone ""petals."" Those hold them gently inside your ear. 

The sound is the remarkable part, these tiny devices boost the sound frequencies needed to counteract your hearing loss. As such, the sound heard is natural and full frequency. All the bass and much of the mid-range frequencies can still sneak by the petals to be heard directly. 

Most of us with moderate hearing loss, have lost high-frequency response. So the Eargos fill that in. 

Even critical listening to music is a pleasure with the Eargo 7s. 

Are they worth the money? You bet they are. Just as I wouldn't be without my glasses, I won't be without my Eargos, they are a critical part of who I am since my hearing loss."

9,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Helps a lot,Very pleased with these. I like that they aren't obvious to those around me. It really helps me hear my wife. I was concerned about wind noise when I drove my convertible. But that has turned out to be a non issue. I do wish they had Bluetooth streaming. But I understand that the technology is just not that small yet.
9,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Excellent Sonic Fidelity,"I have had my Eargo 7s for four weeks now. They are an upgrade from the Eargo 5s I bought a few years ago. They are the same tiny configuration and comfortable fitting with medical-grade silicone ""petals."" Those hold them gently inside your ear. 

The sound is the remarkable part, these tiny devices boost the sound frequencies needed to counteract your hearing loss. As such, the sound heard is natural and full frequency. All the bass and much of the mid-range frequencies can still sneak by the petals to be heard directly. 

Most of us with moderate hearing loss, have lost high-frequency response. So the Eargos fill that in. 

Even critical listening to music is a pleasure with the Eargo 7s. 

Are they worth the money? You bet they are. Just as I wouldn't be without my glasses, I won't be without my Eargos, they are a critical part of who I am since my hearing loss."

11,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,A Great Hearing Solution - Opens Accessibility,"The Lexie B1 hearing aid is an over-the-counter (OTC) hearing aid solution for those people with perceived mild to moderate hearing loss. I fortunately (unfortunately I guess) fit into that group as I have mild hearing range loss in my right ear coupled with tinnitus. I have been living with loss of higher frequency sensitivity in my right ear for the better part of the last 15 years. I have seen an ENT and gotten testing done by audiologists to confirm my specific hearing deficit. Unfortunately, my hearing loss was mild enough that I would not be eligible for any assistive devices covered by insurance. My hearing loss affects me during conversations - especially if I am driving since its my right ear that is affected - and watching TV with other external noises present. 

I went through the procedure for setting up the Lexie B1’s starting with downloading their app. I was assisted by my girlfriend during the setup process, since she had prior experience with hearing aids as a home health nurse. I could have done it on my own, but having another person there to help with the ear/wire sizing was very useful. The B1’s come with the #2 (per the fitting guide) size wire, and multiple sized eartips (small/medium/large in open and closed style). I actually landed right in between #1 and #2 for wire sizing, so The #2 size works for now. You have to go to Lexie’s website to order different wire sizes, and any additional replacement parts. The guide recommends replacing the wires yearly and replacing the wax guards and eartips every 3 months. There are no extras included with the hearing aids, so plan to order these ahead of time. The package also includes batteries – size p312 QTY of 8. Battery life is stated to be around 4 days at 14hrs of wear time each day. I got about 5 days, but I wasn’t wearing them for 14 hours – closer to 5. Unfortunately, I forgot to open the battery door (which powers the aids off) overnight 2 times, which drained the battery significantly – lesson learned.

As far as use and comfort goes the B1’s were easy to live with. I wear glasses (fairly thin framed) so the body of the hearing aid rested between my frame and ear. The first day that I wore the hearing aids I lasted about 2-3 hours before my ear started itching like crazy, and I needed to take a break. Over the course of a week I was able to extend my wearing time to 6-7 hours without much fuss. The only thing I am still trying to get used to is the fatigue from hearing the pumped up sound – I have been used to diminished hearing for so long that hearing the world at proper sound levels is taxing. I don’t suspect it will be a problem long term, but it is something I am still adjusting to. Each hearing aid body has a single button for volume +/-, which bumps the world volume up/down by 5 for each press. I didn’t notice anywhere that I could adjust the increase/decrease amount – it would be nice to set the button to adjust by 2 or whatever for a more granular tuning.

Within the app I set up my custom hearing modes to tailor the B1’s to my needs. I played around with the directional settings, volumes, and bass/treble. It honestly took some time to figure it out because not every situation is identical. The app allows you to save 10 custom modes. I went through and made modes with different combinations of bass/treble and directionality, and then I toggled through them to see what worked best for me. I found that adding treble really helped with conversations, while adding base made for a less fatiguing listening mode for regular listening purposes. I mostly used the ‘Everywhere’ directionality setting, but for conversation with my GF at a noisy restaurant I switched it to ‘Forward’.

I did find improvement in my ability to hear conversations and TV volume. Conversations in the car saw the most improvement especially when talking to my kids in the backseat. Walking outside I also picked up on noises that I was apparently missing out on – birds in the trees being the biggest one (higher frequencies being my deficit). I also found a side benefit - I noticed a reduction in how loud I perceived the tinnitus in my right ear. Very quiet spaces are a chore with the ringing and sometimes just a little extra ambient noise is enough for me to drop focus of it. The bumped up sound from the hearing aid provided enough lift for the environmental noise to help drown it out.

Some things to note for me: since my deficit is localized to my right ear it would be nice to see a single ear version offered. I know I am not the only one out there with hearing loss in just one ear. Hopefully if these gain enough traction that could be something available further down the road. If you are setting these up for use with just one ear you can do that, but I had to power both left and right devices the first time I connected them to my phone. After that I was able to connect with just my right ear powered. 

Overall, I found the Lexie B1’s to be pretty useful for my needs. I feel like I fit the profile for the type of person that would need something like this because I can’t easily get hearing aids through insurance. I found them comfortable enough, and easy to setup and configure. The carrying case is nice, and the devices are barely noticeable on your head when in use (I was self-conscious of this to start)."
11,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Cool hearing aids,"The Lexie B1 OTC hearing aids right out of the box look great, of good quality all round. In the box there are the aids, manual, brush, extra domes, batteries, measuring tool and finally the carrying case.  The aids are intended for mild to moderate hearing impairment and they amplify sound.  These are over the counter yet of high quality but not for everyone.  With that said, with the Bose logo on them, I have gotten asked about them since Bose makes great sound products. 

Setup, after getting everything out of the box there are options on how to set them up. First you can use the manual that is included and It shows everything you need, from safety, setup, how to wear, app controls care and maintenance as well.  There is also support on their website and it includes videos, unfortunately the video on how to measure your ear is not fully shown since it stops before ending. So look for the video that shows how to measure your ear to determine to correct size receiver wire Lexie B1and B2, this other video is complete.  Lastly if you download the app, it walks you step by step on how to set them up.  

It has a few things that are convenient such as it comes with different dome sizes and each ear might have a different size so keep that in mind and measure each side.   Also the color coded sides, blue is left and red is right so I do not have problems putting them on. 

As for the volume, It is easy to increase and decrease world volume from the aid.  Furthermore in the Lexie application this can be done as well as increasing the treble and bass.   Also directionality is great because it can amplify everything or just the front; this last one is for better focus to have a better conversation when surrounded by noise.  Also in the app volume can be adjusted on each ear since one ear might need more volume than the other.  

Comfort, they are comfortable to wear all day, it just takes time to adjust and get used to them, I really like how well designed these are because these are smaller, thinner and just well-hidden around my ears.  

The aids come with batteries and they are easy to change and best of all, the aid will let you know “low Battery” so time to exchange, if you do not want to change batteries then consider the Lexie B2 since the set is rechargeable.  

The very nice case that these aids come with looks great and there is plenty of space for them. 

I would like for them to have an off switch even if it’s from the app, to turn them on, I would press volume up.  I would prefer that instead of opening the battery compartment every night.  

Overall, I like that they are easy to use even if I didn’t use my smart phone a lot.  I also like that if I need help, Lexie Experts are available to assist.  Lastly they are FSA/ HAS and HRA eligible."
11,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"Amazing quality, great case, and I can HEAR!","The Lexie B1 hearing aids by Bose are incredibly easy to use and lightweight! I suffer from hearing loss that is especially bad if there are a lot of other ambient voices, the Lexie Hearing app allows you to focus in either in front of you or all around. The app also allows for either preset or customized hearing profiles for different settings and environments. The box contains everything you need to get started and you are immediately welcomed by the Bose quality materials one would expect from a product made by Bose. It contains the hearing aids inside the very nice, compact carrying case that in no way screams ""these are hearing aids."" The box also contains the quick start guide to get you started with fitting and using the Lexie Hearing app, along with different size ear tips and wires. The fit is very comfortable and easy to adjust to your preference and the aids themselves are incredibly lightweight! You will barely know they're there, which can be an issue if they call out... a good fit is especially important to prevent this! The carrying case has no electronics but offers a very protective environment for your hearing aids while you're not using them. There is no power switch, instead you open the battery door to turn them off for long periods... a simple but odd solution. The battery is incredibly long lasting, even if you forget to open the battery door, the battery will survive well into the next few days. I have only had to replace the batteries once in the month I have been using these (I mostly wear them in the afternoon when out or during in-person work meetings, 3-4 hours a day). Overall, I would absolutely recommend these to anyone who is suffering from hearing loss and is looking for an off the shelf solution to help make your life better! I would even recommend these over the B2, as the common hearing aid battery in this device promotes life beyond the lithium battery in the B2 and easily replaceable when travelling in places that may not offer USB power options."
11,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Falls Just a Bit Short,"I have been anxious to try these over-the-counter (OTC) hearing aids ever since Bose first announced they were working on them a couple years ago.  I have used hearing aids fitted by an audiologist for eleven years now, and my experience with them (two different brands) have been somewhat less than what I had hoped for.  Bose decided to sell their technology rather than bring to market the hearing aids themselves, hence the “Lexie B1, Powered by Bose”.  I find it interesting that the body of the hearing aids and the carrying case all are branded “Bose” rather than “Lexie”.  They are marketed for users with “mild to moderate” hearing loss, and my hearing loss is defined as moderate, but is probably toward the end of the moderate scale away from mild.  This gave me some doubts as to whether or not they would be powerful enough for me, but I wanted the opportunity to experience the ability to try to tailor them to my liking on my own without having to make multiple trips back to the audiologist for programming tweaks.

The Lexie B1 is designed as a “receiver-in-canal” (RIC) hearing aid which is one of the most popular, if not the most popular design of hearing aid today.  “Receiver” is kind of a confusing name for what is essentially a “speaker” and is the part where the amplified sound comes out of.  The main body of the hearing aid rests behind your ear and contains the microphone(s), battery compartment, amplifier and sound processing circuitry, and the button that controls the volume.  The receiver is covered with a soft rubber “dome” that holds the receiver in your ear canal and is connected to the body of the hearing aid by a thin wire that lies flat against your skin.

The Lexie B1 mimics the style of many “prescription” hearing aids that you buy from an audiologist.  But like any electronic device there are differences in design and features due both to designer choice and the price point that the device is manufactured to be sold at.  My hearing aids (a top-of-the-line model) from an audiologist were just over five times the MSRP price of the Lexie B1 OTC hearing aids, so is it fair to make a direct comparison?  Absolutely not.  But, it is inevitable that I do so if only to point out what Lexie got right and what a user might be shortchanging themselves on by going the OTC route.

The User Manual that comes with the Lexie B1, Powered by Bose is very well done, especially the part that explains hearing loss, what to expect from using hearing aids, when to see a medical professional, how to fit and set up the devices, and all of the usual warnings and precautions.  That being said, this style of hearing aid and the care and maintenance that goes along with it, is not really a device that you gift to your 80-year-old parent or grandparent and leave them to their own devices.  There is a certain amount of manual dexterity and visual acuity required to use this product properly.

I’m going to be upfront and admit that the amplification of the B1 is not enough for me to utilize them as a viable alternative to my prescription hearing aids, especially out in public.  Maybe if I were using them in a quiet setting and watching TV or having a conversation with one other person they would be sufficient, but they just don’t have enough amplification for my individual needs.  The nice thing is that Lexie gives you a 45-day money-back trial period just like the prescription aids do, so you really have nothing to lose in trying them.

Some observations and inevitable comparisons - I was hoping for a tone control with more adjustability, kind of like a graphic equalizer with the ability to make a lot of different adjustments over the frequency scale rather than just a slider control that simply varies between bass and treble.  Besides the “world volume” control, there is a balance control in case you need one side louder than the other.  Volume is also adjustable via the buttons on the hearing aid bodies and the control on either aid will adjust the volume in both units.  In addition to these adjustments, there is also a directionality setting so you can choose to have the microphones concentrate on sounds in front of you rather than all around you such as when trying to have a conversation in a noisy place.  There are what Lexie calls “Environment Settings” which are a way of saving volume, tone, balance, and directionality settings as a group, custom-tailored to specific circumstances such as noisy indoor, outdoors, music, etc.  This allows you to easily change a variety of settings with the push of one “button” on the phone app.  Prescription aids also have these “programs” that your audiologist can create and some aids allow you to change these via the buttons on the hearing aids so that you don’t have to do it with the phone - the B1 requires you to access the phone app to make any change other than simple volume control.  The wires that connect the body of the hearing aid to the receiver are much stiffer and more resistant to having their shape reformed than what I am used to.  This seemed to make it harder for me to get the receivers inserted into my ear canals.  Maybe this would get easier with more experience with this product.

In the user manual, Lexie states that the “Expected Service Life of Product and Components” is two years, and the B1 comes with a one year warranty.  Prescription aids commonly come with two or three year warranties and my eleven-year-old hearing aids still work - but with advancements in technology, five years is probably a more realistic life expectancy for prescription devices.

I’m giving the Lexie B1 a rating of four stars because the design is better than a number of other OTC hearing aids I have seen in the marketplace, so it deserves better than an average (three star) rating.  I’d like to give it five stars but can’t because of the rudimentary adjustability of its frequency response curve - I think if you’re going to make a product that offers user adjustability, you should allow it to offer true customization to the user’s needs.  For those people that are reluctant to use a hearing aid because of the social stigma that is still attached to hearing aids, this design is so unobtrusive that when I got my first pair of aids, no one at work noticed them until I started telling people seven months later.  I kid you not when I say people just do not notice these hearing aids, so put your concerns aside and quit cheating yourself by continuing to live with a major part of your live being compromised.  An OTC hearing aid is a good jumping off point for those consumers still debating if they are ready to make a positive change in their lives."
11,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,OTC Hearing Aid - Highly Tunable - Tiny size !,"Note 50-84

A little about my own hearing loss - As clinically measured I have 45-60% hearing loss ( depending on range ) in one ear
as a result of scarring, repeated rupture of eardrum etc. The other ear is essentially normal. This results in a very
unbalanced world that I am adjusted to but it does present a lot of minor annoyances - especially when it comes to 
clarity of speech ! 

Overall Impressions - I opened the box, installed the batteries and walked through setup in a few minutes using the app and 
an online setup guide. After trying a few scenarios with my television, others having a conversation and using a 
speakerphone I found just the right spots for indoor use. I then took a walk and tweaked them a bit more for an 
outside environment. They work well ! The selective directional boost and ""world volume"" let me balance things out 
to around what would have been roughly normal prior to hearing loss. In my circumstance, I still have near perfect
hearing in one ear and this works effectively to balance things out. To me the most important boost is clarity of 
speech both from speakers and live people which these do an amazing job of without being ""Too loud"". 

Maintenance and Batteries - Standard cleaning tools and replacement wires and cups are inexpensive. 
Battery costs are minimal, around a dollar a month for name-brand 312 batteries. 

Fit and Comfort - After a few minutes these just disappear and you will likely forget you are wearing them.
While I don't need these in every situation, I can wear them for 12+ hours at a time without any discomfort.
I also managed to fall asleep more than once while reading - I don't recommend that. If you sleep on your 
side you will likely wake up with a sore spot behind your ear ! 

Software - I tested the application and pairing on an Iphone. It took a a few minutes to setup and was 
simple to use. Push the buttons and move the sliders. The layout is well labelled and intuitive. It also 
works correctly with scaling / zoom enabled. 

What I love - 
IP67 Water resistance !
4-5 day real world battery life - That's less than a dollar a month on batteries !

Could be improved - 
SOFTWARE - Please add independant tuning controls for those of us with hearing damage in only one ear !
Phone calls - Cannot be fed directly through to the hearing aids however I am able to use an iphone as 
normal on my left side now."
11,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,OTC Lexie B1 - very near prescription quality.,"The Lexie B1 OTC hearing aids powered by Bose are one of the best purchases I have ever made.  I could not be happier.  
After the regulations were approved for OTC aids I began searching for my pair.  I first tried another, slightly cheaper brand, but returned them with disappointment. My friend with prescription aids visited and had me try them.  I was surprised at level of quality compared to the discount brand.  Then she told me to have a look at the OTC Lexie brand. I am so glad I did!
First, the size is excellent. The discount ones were more than twice the size of these. So comfortable behind the ear even with glasses.
Second, having the speaker in the ear is key. When you only have the hollow tubes piping sound into your canal, a lot is lost along the way. The wired tubes with the transmitter directly in your ear is the way to go. Very impressive sound.
Third, the discount brand I tried, although also operated with a phone app, continually disconnected. They tried to sell me on picking up an iPhone for compatibility. Seriously ridiculous.  These connected to my Samsung Galaxy S10+ without any problems. Every time I put them in my ears and open the app they re-connect. Much different than the hassle of my previous trial.
Lastly, and this is simply a preference, although they sell the rechargeable model B2 as well, after having the previous rechargeable ones, I opted for the battery powered option. The battery powered aids are slightly smaller as there is no need for recharging technology. The other reason was, after having the previous rechargeable ones, the battery may go low in the middle of the evening and you have no option but to put them on the charger. I suppose the B2 could have better, quicker charging capabilities, but I love being able to pop out the old batteries and simply put in a fresh one with immediate response, not having to wait hours for a new charge.
The Lexie B1 OTC are truly a fantastic set of hearing aids. It's amazing to be able to hear in a crowded atmosphere again. Even when someone is talking from across the room of 20 others. I 100% recommend these."
11,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Good value,"I have had these for about two months.  I bought these as a second pair as my old ones were wearing out.  I am very pleased with the fit and how they work.  It took some getting use to the fact that I had to self adjust, but the helpline helped my with my questions.  They fit perfect out of the box, no adjustment needed.  The wires are a little tight, but that may be the way they are packed.  Once I have them on, I cannot even tell I am wearing them, as they are so comfortable.  For mild to moderate hearing loss they work great. I had tried other over the counter hearing aids, but was not satisfied with the sound quality."
11,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Great sound.  Easy to use.  No need to see a Dr.,"These hearing aides are similar to other models that my mother in law tried.

For brief background, my mother in law has lost her hearing over the years and has had several hearing aids over the course of of her life.

She hates to wear them because they don't fit, fall out or just flat out are not comfortable.  So if she does not wear them, having conversations with her without them can be hard and frustrating for everyone!

Bose's hearing aides helps resolve that comfort issue.  So she is now more willing to use them because of those break through factors.

Setup was easy.  Follow the on boarding screen and you are in.  I had to do this for my mother in law because she was not that familiar with doing this.  Most users can do this but she is in her 80s and she couldn't.

Operating these hearing aides was pretty easy. Easy to put in the ear and position. Didn't need to change anything.  It did not fall out.  

Software use to find tune listening conditions easy.  Various set programs and also treble and bass adjustments are easy.

Battery life is undetermined.  These are the disposable battery model.  By the time of this review I can't tell how long the disposable batteries will last.  

Carrying case is nice to to have.  Compact and small.

Glad hearing aides are over the counter now....  Folks are less apprehensive to getting them on their own and being discreet in buying them.  Base on all this I would recommend these hearing aides based on this experience."
11,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Improved My Ability to Hear,"I was a bit skeptical about Over The Counter (OTC) hearing aids. I had learned to read lips in restaurants and other noisy settings. It was things like the security system, door bell and smoke detectors that really had me worried.  I love how much the Lexie B1 Hearing aids help me with hearing everything no matter where I am.  

 It took me about three days to learn how and when to change the settings but once I got familiar with the hearing aids themself and the APP I was so much more at ease. I like that I am in control of what I hear.  If I’m in an area where there is a lot of background noise I use the “front” setting so I can hear the person in front of me while softening the background noise.  When I go walking I like to hear the sounds of nature so the “everywhere” directionality setting is my choice.  The first day I could only wear them about 4 hours because my ear hurt where my glasses and hearing aid overlapped. The next day was the same. I wore them longer the 3rd day.  Now I can wear them all day. 

The hearing aids themself are color coded so it’s simple to get them in the correct ear.  I like that they run on batteries so I don’t need to worry about charging them when traveling or hiking. I simply put extra batteries in my backpack or purse. 

I have long hair and wear glasses.  My glasses fall down really often on my nose and the hearing aid makes a lot of noise when I push my glasses back.  That is The reason I rated these hearing aids a 4 star instead of a 5. I really do love these hearing aids but wish they were less noisy when adjusting glasses."
11,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Amazing Hearing Aids!,"I was on the lookout for a new hearing aid solution that would meet my needs. The Lexie B1 Powered by Bose Self-fitting OTC Hearing Aids caught my attention, and I was excited to give them a try. I have to say, I have been thoroughly impressed with the product and its features.

The self-fitting process was incredibly easy and straightforward. The package comes with multiple hearing aid dome sizes and an ear measuring tool, making it simple to ensure a proper fit. I was also pleasantly surprised by how discreet and comfortable the hearing aids are to wear. The lightweight and behind-the-ear design make them almost invisible to others, and I can wear them all day without any discomfort.

One of the standout features of the Lexie B1 hearing aids is the Lexie app, available for free on the App Store or Google Play. The app has proven to be an exceptional tool for customizing the hearing aids to my personal preferences. I can adjust the World Volume to turn up the sounds around me, so I can hear better, with quiet sounds being amplified more than loud sounds for a more comfortable listening experience. I can also adjust the treble and bass settings to make voices and sounds more natural. The app allows me to store my preferred settings for different environments, such as my favorite restaurant or popular walking trails.

Another feature I particularly like about the Lexie B1 hearing aids is the ability to focus on sound coming from the front or everywhere. This feature has made conversations, especially in noisy environments, so much easier. The Lexie app also lets me store my preferred settings as environment settings for different places and situations, making it quick and effortless to adjust my hearing aids when I need to.

In conclusion, I highly recommend the Lexie B1 Powered by Bose Self-fitting OTC Hearing Aids. The ease of self-fitting, tunable app, and discreet design make this product an excellent solution for anyone struggling with mild to moderate hearing loss. I have been extremely satisfied with my experience with the Lexie B1 hearing aids and would recommend them to anyone looking for a high-quality, easy-to-use, and customize hearing aid solution."
11,BestBuy,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,Good Hearing Aids with Shortcomings,"Likes:   Decent sound.  The most important thing is sound quality.  Overall these are good.   Definitely have to adjust them to get the best sound.  Can be extremely sensitive. It took me a while to find that perfect sound.   Clearly your surrounding environment makes a huge difference.  The App makes adjustments pretty easy.   I like the carry case.  Well made and designed.  It is packaged well and neatly.  

Dislikes:   To me this is not properly advertised.  These are NOT Bluetooth in the way that most think. The Lexie App is the ONLY thing that works via Bluetooth.  You CANNOT stream music, radio, and more importantly, hearing Apps.  I have several hearing Apps that were recommended by my audiologist.  I cannot use any of them because these hearing aids will not connect to your phone.  I have serious tinnitus and require masking Apps to combat the noise.   Using these I cannot use any of them.  The other thing I do not like is there is no on/off switch.  The only way to turn them off is by opening the battery compartment.  For people with poor fine motor skills or large fingers, that does not make it easy to power them on and off.  At this price point, that makes no sense to me.  A simple power button is needed.  So if you take them out and forget to open the battery compartments, they will stay on and kill the batteries.  Lastly, these are NOT for very large ears.   I’m 6’2” and these are a very tight fit.  These are not adjustable at all in terms of size.  Instead of sitting behind my ears and being near invisible, these pull down on my ears and can be easily seen.  If I pull them behind my ear to be near invisible, they pop out of my ear canals.  

Bottom Line:   If you need hearing aids, do your homework.   For basic hearing needs, these are fine.  But at this price point, I think rechargeable batteries, a power button, and Bluetooth Streaming Capability should be present.  I feel like I’m paying for the BOSE name more than anything.  In the end, I just can’t recommend these.  I really wanted to love these.  I was mostly disappointed."

Sometimes it has a tough time singling out voices in noisy environment, but for the money, it does good enough to be considered a good buy.  Certainly a great first hearing aid, and less expensive than most in its class."
11,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Great replacement for prescription hearing aids,Got these for my wife after she lost one of her very expensive prescription hearing aids.  The Lexie hearing aids work great.  They fit her comfortably right out of the box.  The Lexie app links to the Lexie hearing aids much more reliably over a wider range than the prescription app and hearing aids did.  The app is very easy to use.  Delivery was prompt via UPS.  Overall we're very pleased with the Lexie B1s.

11,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Great purchase,I totally enjoyed my first pair. I was in need of  my second pair. I purchased the same brand Lexie. I always have always purchased high priced hearing aids. Lexie hearing aids are affordable and great quality.
11,BestBuy,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,Worked well but would not stay inserted in ears,"I regret that I had to return my B1’s this morning.  They worked well when they remained inserted, BUT they would not stay in my ear canals, despite my trying both standard and longer tubes and each of the three cushion sizes and no matter how little my head moved around.  

A video call and follow up phone call with Lexie staff confirmed that there was nothing more Lexie could do to make the cushions remain in my ears.  Instead, they suggested that I get clips at Amazon that would prevent me from losing the hearing aids if they should dislodge completely.

My ear and head dimensions are not remotely unusual, so I bet my problem isn’t remotely unusual.  The B1’s are a fine product if you can use them as intended.  If you buy them, just be sure that you keep track of your return deadline and monitor closely the fit."

11,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Great sounding,"First, these are very comfortable to wear.  I have been trying some different hearing aids lately and so far, these are one of the more comfortable ones I have worn.  This is mainly due to that I like this style where they fit behind the ear and then have a tube that goes to the eardrum.  Some of the others I have tried are similar to aid buds where they go into your eardrum and sit in the inner part of your ear and not behind.  My issue with those style is that my left ear has a lump in that spot, so it pushes out the hearing aids.  With this style, even if the piece comes out from the eardrum, it does not fall out and onto the ground and I can quickly push it back in.   Another reason I prefer this style is because of it looking like a hearing aid.  When I wore the air bud style, I would get asked about them all the time and have to explain they are for hearing.  With these, everyone seems to know that is what they are for.  

A few things I would have liked to see.  I would have liked to see these come with rechargeable batteries, and a rechargeable case.  That was not the case, and they only came with a round hearing aid battery pack.  I have a hearing aid from same company that at least came with a few of those battery packs.  the round battery pack comes with 8 batteries.  If you use a lot, you will go thru a couple batteries in a week.  

I would also have liked to connect them via Bluetooth to listen to music, videos, and games.  These only connect via Bluetooth to allow you to use the app with these.  

The app.  I had issues at first trying to get these to work.  That was because like I mentioned, I already have another pair from this company (Lexie).  Those were synced with the app and so it would not let me set up another set.  I had to delete my account and re do my account and then I was able to select these and set them up.  It would have been nice to be able to just set up another hearing aid and not have to do that.  I also was surprised that the app was different when I set these up.  Same app but with pairing these, once done, the app was different.  I liked that it did not make me have to do a hearing test, however at the same time, I wished it would have let me choose that so that it would set these up first and then I would have loved to go in and customize it a bit.  This is a main reason for me giving it a 4 star.  

Sound.  Well, this with how comfortable these were for me, is why I am giving it a 4 star.  These are the main 2 things I am looking for in hearing aids.  And these sound pretty good, especially compared to my other few that I have tried out.  Being that they are Bose, I am disappointed that I can't listen to music etc.  

They also come with a pretty nice case.  Has 2 spots, one for each hearing aid.  I do wish that they would have maybe make a spot to put the brush.  It fits in the case but a lot of times when I open the case it gets pulled to the side as it has metal, and the sides have magnets to hold the case shut.  

Overall, I am happy to have these.  Once I got them to work, I was pleased with how well they sounded and how well they fit.  I wore them for hours from the start which normally I have to wear in small increments until I am used to them.  

If you are looking for a pair of hearing aids and don't care to listen to music, calls, movies, games etc. then I recommend these.  Even if you only need 1 hearing aid.  These are identical, you just swap the tube piece.  So, if one stops working, you can just swap the tube piece onto the other hearing aid, and it will work.  

With that note, that was something else, I was surprised these did not come with different length tubes.  It comes with a tool piece that you place on ear, and it tells you what size tube you should use.  But does not provide extra tubes.  

Even though I mentioned more negatives than positives, I feel the couple positives that I did mention are huge and out weight the negatives."
11,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Helpful and High Quality!,"I’ve been testing and wearing the Lexie B1 hearing aids for about 5 days now, so my opinions here are still early, but I’ve found these guys to be so helpful.  Hearing aids were a completely new experience for me.  I’ve used earbuds that had an “ambient” mode, but they are not particularly well suited for anything but having a quick chat without taking out the buds.
These do not stream from your phone, but that is not what they’re for.  These are single purpose devices that do the task very well.
They are so small.  My wife had a hard time noticing when I was wearing them or not.  They are comfortable to the point that I forgot about them most of the time.  They can be a tiny bit irritating after a full day of use, but I’m sure that is something I will get used to.  I was able to use the eartips installed from the factory with great results, but it comes with a wide selection of tips for all shapes and sizes.  There are tips with holes to let in outside sound and tips that are solid and much more isolating.
These are well packaged and everything in the box appears to be recyclable, good job there, Lexie.
I have used these with and without the app, and one of the nice things is once you’ve made your adjustments they will hold the settings even if the phone is not around.
The app has a few adjustments that could have been done with on-device buttons as I rarely found myself using the app once I had the B1s set up to my liking.  I really was surprised at the low frequency enhancements by turning the tone more toward bass, the lows these are able to recreate are really clear and powerful.  I can imagine someone with low end hearing loss getting good results with these.  The high end can be rather piercing if the volume is too high, but for someone with high end hearing loss, all that headroom in the high end should be super helpful.  Small sounds like your hair brushing your collar or maybe the keys of your keyboard will seem much louder than you are used to, but you get used to the differences rather quickly.  There is an adjustment period, but everything can’t work exactly as we expect, there are going to be small nuisances that come with the benefits, no big deal.
The directionality setting is iffy in my experience, I did not find it to be much more helpful in conversation than the standard setting except in a noisy building lobby.
I can hear my wife’s voice better now, even with a very low “World Volume”.  These can get really, really loud, I get a lot of help from them with the volume down around 18 or so, clearly I’m a “mild” case.
The batteries are zinc-air hearing aid batteries, size 312, so if you keep a couple in your pocket or wallet, you will not get caught out with a dead battery, they’re a cinch to replace.  I think this is a much better solution than rechargeable batteries, since you can have a battery go low and just swap it and be back in business, rather than waiting around for a charge.
The B1s each have a volume rocker on the top that adjusts the World Volume, adjusting one side will change the volume on both units, which is very nice.  There is no power switch on the units themselves, they have a sliding battery door that acts as a power cut off, you just pull the battery tab a little bit to release it from the first lock and they are powered down, snap them back in and you’re good to go in about 5 seconds.
One of the things I’ve been having a little bit of trouble getting used to is the echo effect with my own voice as there is a tiny processing delay in the units, so when they amplify your own voice, you hear yourself, then a fraction of a second later, you hear yourself again.  When I switched to the solid eartips, this effect went away mostly.  I prefer the eartips with the slots as it lets you hear “through” the hearing aids, so you’re getting a boost, but not getting the feeling that you are hearing the world through a straw.
Overall, I’m really impressed, the Lexie B1s are keepers for sure – comfortable and effective and I look forward to being able to participate in conversations from which I would previously have just sidelined myself."
11,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Works as advertised with some room for improvement,"These hearing aids are marketed to people with mild to moderate hearing loss. I am not sure what constitutes ""mild to moderate,"" but in the product information they do talk about having difficult hearing people speaking in a noisy environment, which is a problem that I have, so I figured I would give these a try. I have never worn hearing aids before, so, unfortunately, I do not have any basis for comparison. Thus this truly is a first impression of not only these hearing aids, but of hearing aids in general.

To begin, I was really surprised with how small they are. When I think of hearing aids, I cannot help but think of the older behind-the-ear units that are about the size of someone's thumb. These, in contrast, are about the width of an average pen (at their thickest) and are only about an inch (or so) long. The tube that goes from the device to the earpiece is also very small and transparent. When wearing them, they are hardly noticeable. I also found them to be very comfortable. After a minute or two, it's easy to forget that they are there. The earpiece took a little getting used to. For a while it felt like I had a cotton swap stuck in my ear (and I wanted to take it out). I suspect that I would have had that issue with any similar hearing aid, though. After all, it is designed to sit inside the ear canal. It probably took me about 30 minutes or so to get used to that.

The setup of the devices was pretty simple, although it does require that you have smartphone because the hearing aids are controlled through an app that you have to download. The hearing aids connect to your smartphone via bluetooth and the setup is relatively simple once they are paired. In this respect, I did hit a hiccup. The app was not finding the hearing aids. I even took the batteries out and put them back in to ""reboot"" the hearing aids. Ultimately, I needed to go into my phone's bluetooth settings to pair them first, then when I went back to the app, things worked just fine with the setup.

The features of the app are pretty simple. You can increase and decrease the volume, shift the audio to have either more treble or more bass (it is a slider so increasing one decreases the other), you can save different settings for different environments, you can mute each side or both, you can adjust the right-to-left balance, and, my favorite, is being able to switch from a general amplification to a directed one where the hearing aids amplify the sounds happening right in front of you (it is directional, which is very helpful for hearing conversations in noisy environments, which is the hearing issue I have).

Once set up, the devices obviously just sit there and do their thing. Again, as I have never worn hearing aids before, I am not sure how good these units are in comparison to a prescription hearing aid (or any other hearing aid, for that matter). Personally, I found the effect to be rather subtle. I am not quite sure what I was expecting, but the difference was not what I would consider to be day and night. Again, it was subtle. I would actually mute them occasionally to try and compare what I was hearing with and without the hearing aids. It did take some adjusting as well to eliminate ""scratchy"" feedback when I would touch or reposition the hearing aids and I found that I had to reduce the treble to get rid of feedback from my own voice. As I shifted from less treble to more bass, however, the amplification effect seemed to decrease.

To really put the devices to the test, I attended a local fundraising event with a lot of background noise (music and people talking). Again, as I mentioned before, the effect was subtle, but I found myself not struggling to hear people as much as I typically do in a loud environment. One awkward thing is that, because the devices are controlled through the phone, if I needed to adjust them during the conversation, that meant pulling out my phone, unlocking the phone, opening the app, waiting for the app to connect to the devices, and then making the change. It is not very subtle or quick when in the middle of a conversation with someone (and it also meant explaining what I was doing so that the person did not think I was being rude by going on my phone in the middle of the conversation). There are volume controls on the devices themselves to increase or decrease the volume, but those are the only controls on the units and there is no ""+"" or ""-"" denoted on the buttons (not that you can see them when they are in your ears) and I cannot remember which is which when I am wearing them. (As the effect is subtle, it was difficult in a loud environment to use the buttons because I was not sure which way the volume was going until I hit an extreme, so to speak.) It would also be nice if the app displayed the amount of battery life that is left. At this point, I have not worn them for long periods of time, so I have no idea how long a battery lasts. (With that being said, the batteries are really small. If you have big fingers or lack dexterity, it can actually be a little challenging to take out the old batteries and put in the new ones. I suspect that is an issue with any hearing aid this size, however. Personally, given advances in technology, I'm kind of surprised they do not use some type of rechargeable technology, like a pair of wireless ear buds for listening to music. Then again, as those internal rechargeable batters deteriorate over time, maybe that would not have been a good design choice in the long run?)

So, overall, these hearing aids do exactly what they say they will. They help amplify the sounds around (or in front of) you, helping folks with mild to moderate hearing loss. The units arrive with a convenient carrying/storage case, a compliment of batteries, extra ear tips, and a brush for cleaning the ear tips. They are also over-the-counter, so to speak, so no need to involve a doctor, which could be both good and bad because you are also on your own when trying to figure out the best setting for yourself, although the company does provide help/support to you. (I did not use it, but it sounds like they are available to help you through the setup and use process, so not having someone physically there to help may not be that much of a detriment.) They are small (discrete), comfortable (once you are used to them), and work exactly how I would expect hearing aids to work. I did find that the sound can be ""tinny"" (higher treble), it can actually amplify your own voice, and touching or moving the units can introduce temporary ""scratching"" feedback (which can also occur occasionally if you move your head quickly). I did wear them with glasses as well, and that seemed to work okay. I suspect most of the shortcomings I noted are common or would be typical with any hearing aid, but having never worn hearing aids before, I cannot be certain in that assessment. Ultimately, however, despite the shortcomings, the units perform as advertised and, as mentioned in the product documentation, the longer you use them, the more your brain can adjust to their input. If half-stars were allowed, I would probably give a 4.5 or so. As it is, there are a few shortcomings (that I mentioned above) the precludes me from giving a 5 star review. (Again, though, I suspect those shortcomings are common in all hearing aids. After all, they are packing a lot of technology in a very, very small package.)

Ultimately, if you suffer from some minor hearing loss, but really do not want to see a doctor or a specialist about it, some self-diagnosis and self-treatment with commercially available hearing aids may be a good solution (and give you an opportunity to ""baby step"" into wearing hearing aids). If something like that sounds like it will work for you, I would recommend these hearing aids. Aside from a few minor annoyances, they seem to work very well."

Last but not least, they did not connect via bluetooth to my dads recent iPhone despite so many attempts and troubleshooting. This purchase was a massive hassle."
11,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Great Help When in a Crowd!,"I have hearing issues while in large crowds or noisy environments. I can pick up some conversation but for the most part it's just muffled drone. I had purchased a pair of Bose Hearphones (that use almost the same app as the Lexie products) and loved them, but people always thought I wasn't listening to them or wanted to know what song a was on.  They had some other advantages but the wear situation just wasn't good.  I had seen the original Bose hearing aids, just never pulled the trigger.  The Lexie version of the (Powered by Bose) hearing aids got me looking more in to these. After receiving them I was kind of worried as the box was tiny! The aids and case are very small and the case is easily pocketable. The hearing aids themselves are really tiny, with small gray bodies that tuck behind your ears, very tiny tubes (wires?) that twist down to your ears and very small ear tips that stick into your ear canal. I had some issues at first trying to figure out how to get them in (luckily one is red for right ear, the other is blue). They come with three size and type (open or closed) tips. If you need a different sized wire or tube, you will need to call Lexie themselves or order on their site. I was told that if you call, the first wire size replacement was free. Once I got them properly positioned, I downloaded the Lexie app for iPhones and fired it up. It looks very similar to the old Bose Headphone app, so I was immediately able to get them functional. Oops, also had to put the extremely small and easily dropped batteries in. The battery door seems a little fragile, which worries me, but it worked. After getting everything set up, I can tell you that these made a world of difference. I can join in conversations at gatherings now that I could never have done before. I love the fit and how the sound can be modified (bass) and the level can be increased or decreased as necessary. Others have complained that there is no off button, but the battery door actually has two distinct indentions that can be open just a little to turn them off (and not drop the battery) or fully opened for battery replacement. Also, many have complained about battery replacement and not rechargeable, and Lexie know has those too (B-2). But I like these better as the rechargeable battery version does not have replaceable batteries so once the stop charging, they are dead. The batteries seem to last around a week or so at 8 hours a day of usage but your milage may vary. Overall, I am completely satisfied with this product and hope they are supported for a real long time. If you have mild to moderate loss or just can't hear a conversation in a crowd these are the way to go!"
11,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Lexie B1 OTC Hearing Aids Powered by Bose,"So I just received my Lexie B1 OTC Hearing Aids Powered by Bose a about a few days ago and have been putting them through their paces. Now I have not been properly diagnosed with any type of hearing loss, though, I have known myself for awhile that my dominant ear is my right ear, which means there has to be some hearing loss in my left ear.

Upon opening the box, you will find:

* The Lexie B1 OTC Hearing Aids
* Storage Case
* powerone EVOLUTION p312 Batteries
* Small, Medium, and Large Open/Closed Eartips
* Ear Measuring Tool
* Cleaning Tool
* User Manual & Quick Start Card

Unlike the Lexie B2 OTC Hearing Aids, which are charged via USB-C, the Lexie B1 OTC Hearing Aids are powered by batteries which are included in the package.

To get  started, simply follow along with the Quick Start guide and download the Lexi app from the App Store for iOS or Google Play Store for Android. Next open up the battery doors and insert the batteries in place. After inserting the batteries, you should be ready to take these babies for a spin. Initially I ran into a couple of issues having to open and close the battery doors before they would finally go into pairing mode. Once paired, the app will take you through the rest of the setup process.

You can the back of the hearing aids to increase or decrease the volume. You can also change the volume within the app and select whether you want to have sound coming from everywhere all around you or just in front of you for more one on one conversations.

Having tried the B2's as stated above, I really like the B1's. My only concern would be how often one might have to switch out the batteries. According to Lexie, the batteries should last between 4 and 5 days. Not sure what that price may look like after awhile, however, I really love the Lexie B1 OTC Hearing Aids. They are smaller than the B2's but sound just as great. 

One thing that I would have like to see is the hearing aids being compatible to work with phone calls from my mobile device as well as music playback from my cellphone. If, that's something you're looking for in a pair of hearing aids, then these are not for you.

Overall I love these hearing aids and think you will too."

11,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,The quality and clarity of Bose is amazing,"As I've  gotten older I've found myself not catching things people say fully sometimes and need them to repeat themselves or speak up a little louder repeating it. Overall my hearing is fine. Just certain things have been giving me trouble so I thought I'd try these out because of the reputation that Bose has carried for decades with their audio equipment. 

The great thing about these are the size! You don't have that big bulky aid hanging on the back of your ear anymore. 

In the box you get one set of hearing aids, a really nice case for protection and storage, multiple domes so that you're sure to get the proper fit. Cleaning tools and of course batteries.

Setting these up specifically for your hearing issues through the app is crucial to get the best bang for your buck. Multiple settings allow you to adjust background noise, treble, world, giving you modes like conversation, outdoors, music, and television it really lets you personalize these for each and every scenario you'd require for any hearing experience throughout the day. Upon testing it you'll be able to level it out so that you don't hear yourself through the aids overwhelmingly and get it to a point where everything is even. 

The thing that really helped me get these to where they worked best is I had someone sit and talk with me as I adjusted and tweaked the different settings in a quiet setting and then in an outdoor setting with a bit of background noise."
11,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Life changing hearing aids.,"WOW I could not be happier with these hearing aids. I was in the Army for 9 years and I was in a tank crew for a part of that as a gunner. Also was deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan using an M249 weapon. I had severe hearing loss in my right ear and some in my left ear. It's not like a firing range were you put in your safety hearing gear you start shooting at a moments notice in and out of buildings and anyone who has ever shot any type of weapon inside a building knows it can knock your equilibrium off because of the weapons load sound and whatever else causes it. So fast forward to now and all those years i have never tried a hearing aid tell now. I cant even begin to tell you the life changing sounds i can hear again thanks to these hearing aids. I use to talk loud because i could not hear myself talking. I use to laugh so loud i would get looks from people like i was just being goofy. I would always have to turn my head so my better ear was pointing to the person talking so i could hear them, But not now. These were so simple to set up with the Lexi app from the apple app store but watch what app your download because the first one i tried wanted me to pay a yearly fee and so good thing i checked because it was not the correct app. The correct one walks you through the setup of the hearing aids and its as simple as putting in the batteries and having the hearing aids close to your phone. Make sure you set them up with the app but have your Bluetooth on so that once it finds them it can finish setting them up in the Bluetooth for you. They are not the big bulky ones of olden days. They are small and very comfortable. They are small enough to almost no even be seen and I'm bald so I don't have hair to hide them at all. The sound quality is amazing and there are 4 different settings you can use like outdoors or music and then you can chose from directly in front of you or all around you. I'm still in shock how well I can hear. The bummer is I do not have the rechargeable type so to save on battery life when I get home i take them out and shut them off. So i go from being able to hear at work but once I'm home and take them out i's like someone is putting there hands over my ears and i cant hear again. It did come with enough battery to last about a month if you get 4 days out of them. You are able to adjust the volume up and down but i normally have mine turned up to about 85 to 90 % and that mite be why I'm getting about 3 days of battery out of them. I'm going to see if i can get a charger for the batteries and then I'll be a happy camper. I can not thank Lexi powered by Bose for making these hearing aids for the public without needing to see an ear doctor. For all the testing and doctors appointments just to tell me what I already knew I had sever hearing loss I would have never been able to afford them. These are a life changer for me."
11,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,I absolutely love these!,"These are an amazing set of hearing aids by Lexie / Bose.  Aimed at people with mild to moderate hearing impairment.  I spent many years in my youth going to loud concerts and am also a musician who plays drums, bass, and guitar.  In your younger years you think you are invincible and never use any kind of hearing protection.  Here I am 30 years later and I have a pretty bad case of tinnitus as well as some hearing loss in both ears.  So I jumped at the chance to give these a try.  Sure, they aren’t cheap.  But compared to getting prescription hearing aids, these were a steal! 
Out of the box I was amazed at how small and lightweight these were.  One thing that might be a small problem for some people is getting the batteries in and out of them.  Since they are so small and the batteries are so small if you have arthritis or something like that, it might be a challenge.  Thankfully I was able to get them in with ease.   They come in a sturdy carrying case so you always know where they are and don’t have to worry about losing them.  Each hearing aid is clearly marked with a L and R so you know which ear they go in.  
Putting them in is very simple.  They easily just slide around your ear.  Once you have them in, you literally do forget they are there.  They are so light and unobtrusive its amazing! 
To use them you need to pair them with the companion app.  That will give you all the customization options to ensure the hearing aids work best for you.  Pairing them is very easy, I was up and running in a matter of minutes.  Once you get them paired you can go into the app and program them for the amount of hearing help that you need.  During the initial setup, it will guide you through everything you need to do in order to customize them for you.  IT literally shows you step by step on the screen what you need to do.  Even if you aren’t tech-savvy at all, you will have no problem setting these up. 
Once you go through the initial setup, you still have customization options that you can change based on the environment you are in.  For me, I have a hard time hearing higher frequencies.  So I can adjust the treble setting to give me more of the higher tones to make it easier for me to hear people.  I was amazed ad how clear things sounded once I got them dialed in.  Usually what I hear are very muffled sounds, but these brought the high end back into my hearing that I have been missing for so many years!  I found that these did a great job of amplifying softer sounds so I could hear them better and blocking out the louder sounds around me as well.  This was great in crowded noisy places like a restaurant.  Usually, I have to ask people to repeat themselves, but somehow these things picked out the things I wanted to hear and amplified them over the things I didn’t want to hear.  Its truly amazing technology!  You just go into the app and select the front mode and it will focus on what is right in front of you.  Then you can turn it back to everywhere mode when you aren’t in such a loud environment.
One thing im on the fence about is that these are battery-operated so you do have to change the batteries every so often depending on your usage.  I know they also make a rechargeable version as well.  I think that would be more convenient, but at the same time, rechargeable batteries don’t last forever.  So Im thinking the regular batteries are the way to go even though it might cost more over time and be a little more inconvenient.  
Overall, I am very impressed with these hearing aids.  Its like it has taken a lot of the damage I have done to my ears over the years and started to reverse it.  For that, I am very thankful!  My wife is as well because I don’t have to keep asking her to repeat herself anymore!  Definitely give these a try if you are in the market for hearing aids.  I think you will be VERY glad you did!"
11,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,One of the best OTC behind the ear hearing aids,"I actually suffer from mild hearing loss in my right ear and moderate to severe loss in my left so now that hearing aids are available over the counter (OTC) you are starting to see a lot of companies jump into the mix.

I'm usually not a fan over the behind the ear hearing aids.  I've actually got a pair of high dollar prescription hearing aids (in excess of $2400 with rechargable batteries and charging case) but they tend to be a bit uncomfortable for long wear.  

The new OTC hearing aids intrege me because there are a multitude of styles.  Some are coming in with earbud style, some with replacable batteries and some rechargable and them some more traditional behind the ear.

Lexie Hearing purchased technology from Bose for their latest offering.  The Lexie B1 have replacable batteries that should give you at least 4 days with about 14 hours of use per day and they brand, age and type of battery used. To make sure you get the most of of the batteries open up the battery compartment when not in use. In the box you do get a package of 8 size 312 batteries.  Hearing aid batteries are easy to come by as they are available at just about any big box store or pharmacy, not to mention online.

The package also comes with 3 sizes of open domes (the part that fits in your ear canal) and 3 sizes of closed domes.  Open domes allow for more ambient sound coming through and the closed domes provide a bit more isolation, best used for front only needs.  You also get a really nice carrying case, ear measuring tool, cable sizing tool, and a cleaning brush (which also has a magnet tip that helps with installing those small batteries).

I downloaded the Lexie app to my smartphone and made sure my Bluetooth was enabled I walked through the step my step setup and I had the B1's tuned for my specific need.  The smartphone app has a quick select for 4 different environments:  noisy indoor (great for restaurants), outdoors, music and then an everyday setting (which is what I use most of the time).  You also have control of World Volume and also the amount of bass you want (less bass allows for better speaking hearing.  The app also has a quick selector that allows you to switch from Everywhere mode to Front Only mode.  The feature I like best is the balance control.  Since I have different levels of hearing loss I can push more volume to my left year to help balance the noise levels making them near equal if not equal.  The app also has links to Lexie support.  One last mention is both hearing aids have ""World Volume"" control on them so you can quickly adjust ambient noise without the app (controls on each hearing aid control both).

Now for the disappointment.  While I understand that the OTC hearing aids are suppose to be offering a more affordable solution than the prescribed hearing aid and while you need to connect to a smartphone to set them up thats all you get with the smartphone connectivity.  There is no streaming capability, no capability to take calls through the hearing aids.  With Bluetooth and Bose's name you would hope that would be a feature to add but I realize that to keep cost down you have to compromise.  In defense though, I've tested 4 or 5 OTC hearing aids and all have this limitation or should I say elimination.  It would be a great feature to add but not sure at what cost.  

All in all I'm extremely pleased with the Lexie B1 aids.  The offer a good solution for what in the past would cost twice as much.  Also, the beauty of the OTC hearing aids is you can use HSA and FSA funds to purchase, if you have those savings accounts through your insurance."
11,BestBuy,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,"Nice, but just not enough for my needs.","I bought these directly through Bose right before Lexie purchased this technology. I had previously purchased several other cheaper over the counter hearing aids and ear buds with pros and cons to all of them. These were quite comfortable and I found I was able to get 3-4 days out of a set of batteries. The units have 4 preset modes and the ability to create additional modes within the app. You can also set the audio input to front facing microphones or omni (all around) directional microphones. Otherwise you have a single slides to tune from base to trebble and I found that I could never quite find that setting that would allow me to hear everyone without making background noise over powering. All in all if you are looking for louder clearer sound in general these seem to be a good fit. They are comfortable easy to use and seem to have good quality. Of all the other over the counter options I had tried up to this point these were probably the best. These do not have noise cancelation like many of the ear buds do, and if you are looking to block out background noise or improve background  noise situations these are probably not a good option. But if you need generaly hearing improvement then they might be a good option.  The is not bluetooth streaming or phone calls with these. The Bluetooth is only for adjusting settings on the units from your phone."
11,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Very good OTC hearing aids.,"Lexie Hearing - Lexie B1 OTC Hearing Aids Powered by Bose - Light Gray

The Lexie Hearing B1 OTC Hearing Aids are a very good option for those of us looking for a more affordable hearing aid. They are the older style of behind the ear with a standard battery. Battery life seems to be good with almost a week between changes for me, your mileage will vary. I use them for restaurants and TV mostly. 
The setup is straight forward and worked without any issues. They pair to your phone via Bluetooth which allows you to control the hearing aids volume, treble/bass, and balance.
There are also built-in modes for different situations. You can select one of them or create your own. Once you have them set up with your phone, the phone is no longer required unless you need to change any setting other than volume. Volume can be adjusted on the phone or on the hearing aids themselves. They come with a card of 8 batteries, 4 sets of ear sleeves, a cleaning brush and a small card that shows you what ear sleeves should be used. In my case I had to go 1 sleeve smaller to make them fit better. There is a nice carrying case that is magnetically latched closed.
The internal circuit of the hearing aids is BOSE designed. With simple interaction on the APP, you will not get the squealing associated with this type of hearing aid.
One note from my use is watching TV I have found it is better to set them for “Everywhere” instead of “Front”. This seems to get a better program volume, probably because watching TV is now in surround. They come with a book that is 112 pages, every answer you need is in there, and if you cant find the answer they have a phone number and are very responsive when called."
11,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Great follow up to the Hearphones,"I was disappointed when they discontinued the Bose Hearphones; I often recommended them to other people as an ideal alternative to hearing aids. When Bose teamed up with Lexie to create these OTC hearing aids, I was elated to find that many of the same features available with the Hearphones are integrated into the Lexie hearing aids app. 

It took a couple tries to get connected and these rely on hearing aid batteries instead of wireless charging. There are pros and cons to this. Hearing aid batteries allow the hearing aids to be smaller [I think] and much less conspicuous than the Hearphones were. The downside is you have to remember to open the battery door before putting back in the case after use or else you'll drain the battery. 

The app allows directional hearing which allows you to focus on conversations in front of you or to take in ambient noise around you. If your phone is set to auto-lock, you'll look a bit odd needing to unlock and reconnect each time you want to alter the volume, but it's certainly better than not hearing at all (or missing half the conversation). This form factor takes a little bit of getting used to over traditional earbuds, and unless the volume is fine-tuned, it's easy to end up with a headache by the end of the day. Overall these are a worthy investment, and because of my great experience with the Bose Hearphones, I'm excited that Bose reemerged with these Lexie hearing aids."
11,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Decent,"Works well. The video walk through makes it easier to get them fitted for the first time. It takes time to get used to having something in your ear. I have used a hearing enhancer previously and this is definitely superior. The battery door can be difficult to open and close for old hands. The right red combo makes it easy to remember which one goes in which ear. It is pleasant to be able to use the phone to adjust it to what is comfortable for me depending on what situation I find myself in. I was drawn in by the Bose name and it did not disappoint. I could see where the batteries could get expensive over time, but this is true for any hearing aid. I like to be able to make my own decisions and decide what is best for me. Having the freedom to adjust things to my comfort level and not have to trust someone that is not in my head to make decisions for me is a definite plus. The size that came on it worked fine for me, but having options is nice for those that need it. It feels secure in my ear."
11,BestBuy,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,Excellent sound quality; Non-recharge batteries,"First off, these hearing aids sound absolutely great. Bose quality for sure. Plus with the free app you can adjust and sort of mix the sound and the bass. You can change the setting for one on one conversation or for use in a louder setting where you'll want more noise cancelling. The quality of the sound is superb; I almost hear my own thoughts it seems. This is the good side of things. The only con I found ends up being pretty costly is the cost to replace the batteries. So The first set of batteries ran out after about a week of use. The fact that I have other hearing aids that are rechargeable, therefore more sustainable and cost efficient, makes these a less desirable option in my opinion. It's not terrible though; I got a pack of 64 batteries for about $16 on Amazon, so these should last me a while, but still, it is an expense. And you need to have extras on hand because you never know when they will run out. 
If batteries are not an issue for you though, these don't do what a lot of more expensive hearing aids tend to do which is just amplifying everything. These are almost like AI where they seem to know what to single out for hearing. They are a little more noticeable in the hear I think, but this is just a personal preference."
11,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Lexie hearing aid,The product has met our expectations. So glad I didn’t spend thousands of dollars. The manufacturer provides good support - they even call me occasionally to see if I need any help!
11,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"Compact, Lightweight, and Clear Audio Hearing Aids","Lexie has knocked it out of the park again with the Lexie Bose self-fitting hearing aids.  These are lightweight and small.  They are comfortable enough to wear all day without noticing they are in.  I wear glasses, but didn’t have any issues with the ear pieces of my glasses and the hearing aids.  Lexie includes 3 pair of open and 3 pair of closed domes.  Whether you prefer open or closed, you’ll be able to find a pair that fit right for you.  These use the size 312 battery which you can find easily enough in stores, so you’ll have no issues with finding batter replacements.

The audio quality is better than any of my other hearing aids.  Lexie’s work with Bose paid off as these are very clear and the noise you typically get with OTC hearing aids isn’t present in these.  Because of great background noise reduction, it takes no time at all to get used to these.  

There is an app that lets you set various profiles.  It also allows you to control volume.  You can also control audio volume directly on the hearing aids.  

I’m really happy with these.  They are the best hearing aids that I have.  I have 4 pair from 4 different vendors, but I’ll be sticking with these from now on.  Lexie and Bose did an amazing job with these."
11,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Lexie Hearing Aids,Comfortable and crystal clear.  They are a life-changing device.
11,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Powerful and easy to program,"Small, powerful, and effective. I had audiologist-prescribed aids before, and this gives as much assistance to my  hearing, plus it cost half as much and is easily adjusted without professional help. I highly recommend this set of hearing aids."
11,BestBuy,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Get a hearing aid - just don't get this one,"I’ve worn a hearing aid in one ear for quite a few years. While I have moderate loss in one ear, the other ear is in excellent shape. This allows me to hear sound both completely naturally as well as through a hearing aid, giving me to ability to judge how naturally the aid corrects for hearing loss. As I type this review, I have five different hearing aids in front of me, one professional and four OTC models. This is the most disappointing of the lot, and it's no even close.

Professional hearing aids require a professional hearing test. Most OTC aids have a somewhat more simplistic in-home test. The reason for this is that almost no one loses all hearing frequencies at the same rate. When an audiogram is created, you can see the peaks and valleys. I am missing high frequencies and low frequencies, but the middle ones remain reasonably clear. Even within the high and low frequencies, I can hear some specific frequencies more loudly and more clearly than others. Every person I know with hearing loss, no matter how mild or severe, has their own unique pattern. 

This is where the Lexie B1 falls apart. Rather than use a hearing test, the B1 has you adjust how loud you want it and whether you want the sounds to have more bass or treble in them. That’s it. So, when I adjust it so that the jingle of a dog’s collar doesn’t hurt my ears, I can no longer even tell when a female voice is speaking to me. If I adjust it to be able to hear a female voice or a low male voice, then a higher male or lower female voice is overwhelmingly, almost painfully loud. On top of this, the sound quality, provided by Bose, cannot match my professional aid or the sound clarity of the Jabra or Sony units I’ve tried.

Yes, the Lexie B1 has some interesting features. You can choose, in the app, whether you want to hear sounds from all around (normal environment) or focus only on what’s in front of you (conversation). It gives you four different environments that you can pre-program. It’s lightweight and comfortable.

But, you can ignore the Bose sound, the interesting features, and the rest. The simple fact is the B1 fails at the one thing it really needs to do well – allow you to replace lost hearing frequencies with the use of an electronic aid. With its all-or-nothing amplification and so-so sound quality, none of the rest of it matters. 

If you have hearing loss, getting hearing aids will be life changing. Do yourself a favor and buy different hearing aids, something that you can really use. You’ll be glad you did."

89,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,A great way to hear!,"The Go Hearing- Go Prime OTC  Hearing Aids are an easy, beneficial upgrade to your hearing capabilities. Whether you have minor or severe hearing loss, or just want to hear better over standard hearing, these non prescription hearing aids can provide a comfortable, stylish solution to help you hearing better.

Out of the box, these hearing aids are pretty simple to use. You need to take them out of the charging case, and each one has a small plastic strip over the charging port that needs to be removed. After doing that, replace each hearing aid back into the case, and then take them back out again and they will turn on automatically. They are labeled for each ear so it is easy to know which ear they go into. They sit pretty deep into the ear canal, so there is a little plastic pull strip that extends off of each hearing aid. I found that it can be a bit tricky to actually grasp the strip, but overall not a difficult process to remove from the ear. 

Using the hearing aids provide a significant amount of amplification into each ear. If you need to adjust the level between your ears, there is a button on the earbud that gives you about 3 different amplification levels. For a more normal feeling, you will tailor the levels to each ear depending on the amount of hearing loss in each ear. If you have normal hearing but want an amplified experience, you will need to make sure both earbuds are set on the same level of amplification or it will seem like one of the hearing aids is not working. I have used the hearing aids for about 6 hours during each use, and found the battery life to be very good, but because these hearing aids sit deeper in the ear canal, they collect ear wax much easier. Cleaning the earwax off of the cups is not the easiest as it gets caught in the little slits at the bottom, but is not such a chore to render them unusable. They do provide different cup sizes for the hearing aid and I would try each one to get the best fit. 

Usuability during use is simplistic. There is nothing fancy to do with these, as they just amplify sound. Although, When using a phone, pressing something toward your ear, or trying to take the hearing aid out will result in some distortion and squeeling from the hearing aid. The sound quality is ok, but it sounds sometimes like it is coming through a tin can. It is not a huge deal though because the goal is for hearing improvement and these earbuds accomplish that. 

Overall, these provide a great improvement to unfortunate hearing loss problems. They may not satisfy all individual needs, but definitely has been an improvement over my hearing loss problems."
89,BestBuy,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Waste of money,Simply stated - GARBAGE!  Impossible to change domes.  Customer service was of no help.
89,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Ears,Good excellent hearing what else can I say ty very much
89,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Gohearing,This item is very good. I improve my listening with Gohearing device. I recomend it. Very good price.
89,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,No frills OTC hearing aid,"The Go Hearing Prime doesn’t try to wow you with a fancy smartphone app but does try to deliver a simple to use over the counter hearing assistance device.   

Rather than relying on a sophisticated smartphone app to fine tune this hearing aid to your need there is a simple single button on each device to let you select the best setting for each ear.   There are 3 modes (Normal, High frequency and Low Frequency) and 8 volume levels per mode.  Each device gives a beep to indicate which mode you are going to (1 beep for normal, 2 beeps for high frequency and 3 beeps for low frequency) and then you continue pushing the button to achieve the optimal volume for you.  Repeat this for each ear.  I find this very useful since I have different levels of hearing loss for each ear.

Once you have it fine tuned you don’t need to adjust again.  However, unlike other hearing aids that have smartphone apps it is a bit more cumbersome to switch between modes on the fly since you have to cycle through each mode and it’s volume settings vs a tap on the phone.   Since there is no connectivity you can not use this to stream media or use it for phone calls.  You will need to decide if you need to pull the hearing aid out while you make calls or use it to amplify your phone speaker.  

They are really easy to place in your ear and with the clear stems it can clutch and extract them just as easily.   Different ear gels are supplied so you can adjust the fit to your ear.  I originally thought the fit was perfect but I would get a ton of feedback while my hand was close to the hearing aid.  Swapping out for a larger ear gel reduced the feedback squeal substantially.  

The hearing aids are rechargeable and come with a rechargeable travel charging case.  I do like that the case has a flat bottom, unlike some others, however the USB-C charging port is on the bottom, I’d much rather have seen it on the back so you can stand it flat on your desk or nightstand while charger.  To me it kind of defeats the purpose of the flat bottom… but that may be just my expectation.  

These are affordably priced and the beauty of over the counter hearing aids is you can still use Flex Savings Account or Health Saving Account funds to reimburse yourself for the cost.

All in all a simple solution and other than having to cycle through all of the settings to adjust for your ambient noise I find these pretty easy to use and could be an affordable solution ."
89,BestBuy,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,Missed the mark for me,"The Go Hearing Go Prime Hearing Aids are marketed as hearing aids for mild to moderate hearing loss. These are extremely small OTC hearing aids that are charged in a small charging case. The 2 hearing aids go into the case and are held in place by magnets. The case holds the charge and in turn charges the hearing aids. Charging is quick and is done via the included USB-A to USB-C cord and power adapter. They supply 3 sizes of domes to get the right fit. The aids, red for the right and blue for the left, are extremely easy to set up. Simply charge them right in the case then put them in your ears. They state that you should get up to 30 hours of charge at a time. There is no app for these, so there is no fine tuning as you might find with other OTC hearing aids.

Right away, these gave me the ability to hear more clearly while watching TV. I could understand what they were saying without having to turn on closed captioning every 15 minutes to catch the lines I couldn’t hear. They fit comfortably and I felt they were secure in my ears. Beyond that, I had issues. 

I could understand what they were saying on the TV, but everything around me was too amplified - when I take a drink, scratch, clear my throat - those are all super loud in my ears! I don’t like hearing the sound of turning pages as I read the brochure, and loudly hearing each tap on the keys as I type this review. I tried all 3 programming settings - Normal, high frequency and low frequency. I adjusted the volume - up, down - nothing made it good for me. They state one of the features of these is “Feedback cancellation” - I just don’t see that working here. To adjust the volume/programs, you press a tiny button on the back of the very small hearing aid. Yes, it is difficult to find and do and every press brought an uncomfortable screeching to my ears. At times, the volume would change on it’s own while wearing them. It would get louder without warning so the while watching tv, it would start blasting in my ears.

There is a FDA indication on the box with a number next to it. Does this mean this device is FDA approved?  I actually believe if they call them hearing aids, they must be FDA approved. These are not sold as hearing amplifiers - but they certainly do amplify the sound! They do provide both a phone number and email address if assistance is needed. I didn’t contact them, so I can’t say how the customer service rates.

Overall, I would have to say I do not recommend these hearing aids. There are better options out there for me now that they can be purchased over the counter (OTC)."
89,BestBuy,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,none,these were more like amplifiers than conventional hearing aids.  Returned them.
89,BestBuy,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Dissatisfied customer,"They are hard to fit and adjust.  No way these were hidden in ears. On first day wax guard got clogged and not able to remove/replace it.  Trying to get it out, a piece broke off so was told warranty was void. Way overpriced. Got some much cheaper that are better."
89,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Great for hearing better,Everything is fine Kept reading instructions over works good
89,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Simple and rechargeable,"I've only used these for about a week now, but here's what I like about them so far: They were super easy to start using--no app to download or Bluetooth connection to mess with. They use rechargeable batteries so no messing with replacing tiny button batteries. They'll run for 30 hours on a charge, then you just put them back in the case and they'll charge up again. The charging case is also small enough that it's easy to keep in your pocket so you can swap them out and not worry about losing them.
The left-blue/right-red color coding is a nice touch so you can easily tell which is which. I do wish the end color was a more neutral tone instead of black so they aren't as noticeable. Even as they are, though, they just look like extra small ear buds and not necessarily hearing aids. I think they're also a reasonable price so you're not risking too much money if you don't like them. Plus, it looks like Best Buy will let you try them for 60 days, at least based on a response in the Q&A from the Go Hearing Team.  
If you want to get more details on how they work before you buy them, I strongly suggest reading the user guide which is conveniently linked in the Overview section on the Best Buy product page. Ignore the Go Lite instructions and just follow the Go Prime model. The only real configuration they might need is to select one of the three audio ""programs"" and then the volume level (1-8). These can be selected for each ear. The default program is ""normal"" which apparently amplifies all frequencies equally. The other two programs can emphasize either low or high frequencies more if you have more hearing loss in one of those ranges. 
The little volume/program button is probably the most troublesome feature on these devices. It's easy enough to use: press and hold for 3-4 seconds to switch between programs and quickly press once to toggle through the 8 volume levels. The problem is I'm constantly hitting the button when I put them in my ears or even whenever I adjust them to fit better. Maybe this will be less of a problem after I'm used to wearing them after a month or two. 
The only other place I see room for improvement is in the audio quality itself. While they do seem to do a good job of amplifying the sounds I want to hear, everything is a bit “tinny” sounding. I’ve had some regular ear buds that pass ambient sound through and it sounded a lot more “normal” than what I get through these. Maybe all amplifying hearing aids have this issue, but it’s still a bit annoying. Overall, though, these do the job and they don’t cost you thousands of dollars."
89,BestBuy,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,"Nice Package and Price, But Not Useful for Me","The Go Hearing - Go Prime OTC is definitely a simple hearing aid. It has really good accessories but the aid itself functions very basically. The magnetic chargeable travel case is wonderful. The fact that these don’t take a battery is also a plus. The extra filter replacements and included size adjusters for the ear piece are great. The aid does stick out of the ear a lot more than the photo on the box seems to show. I also think that they need a much better diagram to show how you should place the aid in the ear correctly. (There is a very basic one but it needs a lot more detail.)

     I have hearing loss in both ears but only wear a right sided aid due to the severity of my left ear hearing loss. For this reason, I only tested with the right aid. It was easy to set up. There is a green sticker you have to take off of each aid before use and then put it in your ear and push the button for volume control and setting control. (You push the same button quickly for volume and hold it a couple seconds to change the modes.) One note about the instruction manual is that page 4 says “Quick Start Guide” and tells you how to set up but then it does’t tell you until page 11 that you should have charged the aids fully before the first use. I think they should have said that as the first thing on page 4.

     When first putting them in the ear, I didn’t notice much change so I turned up the volume. A note about this is that you can only turn the volume up, not down. To make the volume go down you have to turn it all the way up until it double beeps and then the volume resets back at the lowest volume and you can adjust back up from there. That’s really inconvenient. I could definitely hear things get louder but it also made all the sounds have an echo. The sound quality is not good, everything has a robotic or tinny sound. There are three settings for the aid: Normal setting, high frequency mode and low frequency mode. I didn’t notice a huge difference between the first two but I found the low frequency mode to be the most comfortable (though still not great). My voice was echoey in all modes. I tried to see if there was a solution for this and changed out the tips to try fitting the aid in my ear better but nothing helped. The manual even said “ You may hear the internal workings of the device and your own voice may also sound quite loud and hollow. This is normal.” I think that’s definitely problematic. This is not an acceptable standard for hearing. My concern is that those who actually need this aid would be misguided by what an aid can and should do for the average user. The box says “noise and feedback management” but I don’t think it regulates sounds very well. 

Final thoughts: I would not recommend these aids. The only possible use I could think of was maybe for occasional one-on-one conversation in a quiet room or perhaps to hear the tv louder while your friend keeps the volume at their own comfort level, but you would have to be okay with the distortions to the sound quality for that to even work."
89,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,"True Hearing Aids, No Phone Required","I have been testing a lot of OTC earbuds of late, searching for the best for my needs. These GoHearing ones the first I have found that don't require Bluetooth or an app on your phone. The GoHearing Go Prime also sit very discretely inside your ear, they don't look like earbuds you would use for a phone (so people don't assume you're just rude and listening to music when you need hearing assistance) - they sit so neat and deep they have small little pull wires (looks like an antenna) so they are easy to remove. The GoPrime Hearing Aids are comfortable and feel more comfortable than some others I have used.

Setup is easy, as the GoPrime just require you to fully charge them (USB C, cable included) and go. I did have to adjust the volume on each which is a manual process, but it works. Put them in you're ear and they're on right away - no turning them on, no pairing, no nonsense. Audio quality is good, I was able to use during a meal at a restaurant and feel part of the conversation. When not in use there is a design trait I don't like, in that you have to hold the earbud itself and put it in the case backwards - not sure if this is the best hygiene and kind of bothers me - but otherwise, they charge fast using the supplied USB C cable and the case, while not the prettiest, does the job.

Overall, these do the GoPrime do the job, I love that they are truly device free and designed to be hearing aids. If you don't mind that the case isn't cool looking and you insert the earbuds backwards, then they are definitely worth considering if you need a hearing aid.

Best Buy doesn't let me core half, the GoPrime are somewhere between 3.5-4, so I'm giving them a 4.   

PS. I'm not sure if it was on purpose or accident, but there was no instruction guide in the box. You can get the full Go User Manual from the support section of the GoHearing website. FYI, the volume of each earbud can be adjusted independently using the small buttons on the outside of the buds, just press it quickly. If you hear 2 beeps you are at max volume. It's also handy to know that on the case, the blue center light is so you know the case is fully charged, it's not for pairing. These earbuds are not Bluetooth capabale and do not require a phone or app to use."
89,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,A great OTC solution,"The GoPrime hearing aids come very well packaged, with the hearing aids in a hard charging case, a wall plug, a charging cord, and accessories including various size ""domes"" to fit to your ear.  I tried the aids with the medium dome first, which it came with, but it seemed like they might fall out - felt loose.  Once I changed to the smaller domes, the fit was much better.  The instruction book is well laid out, although it is written for two different models - it would be better if it was ONLY for the model purchased.  The hearing aids are very comfortable and light weight - my ears never got sore wearing them.  Controlling the volume and the program mode takes some patience, but mostly because you want to experiment with what sounds the best.  Although the adjustment button is very small, it is easy to control.  I found quite a bit of difference between the normal and high/low frequency settings.  On the normal setting, there was not as much amplification of my own voice, which was good.  It picks up sounds and conversations very well and I only get whistling when putting them in initially.  For an over-the-counter, affordable (compared to prescription aids) hearing aid - this is a great solution."
89,BestBuy,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,Not a product for everyone. But they do work.,"Not what I expected for this type of product. Packaging was nice apon opening. The charging case is what you would expect out of a pair of high end ear buds. I selected these to try based off of the loss of range in my hearing. First these are basically an amplifier that goes in your ear. The sound quality was horrible, I honestly felt like I was in a fish bowl with a tin foil lid. In the house it wasnt horrible other than being able to hear nothing but our fans and air purifiers running and nothing else. Dogs toenails on our hardwood floors were ear pearsing. In the car I had to take them out, the dinging noise was about the only sound that was able to be heard. These do have settings for high tone amplification and low tone amplification, but niether worked for me. Even with the volume on the lowest setting I could not keep them in my ear.Now for someone with far more hearing loss they may work fine. They were super simple to setup and operate. They are very comfortable in your ear. I just feel like they were not right for me. If youre on a budget and need to hear the tv or basic conversation these will probably be adequate. I most likely need prescription hearing aids."
89,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Good but Need a Couple Enhancements,"These hearing aids come in a nice charging box and it’s small enough to take anywhere just like you would ear buds. They are very comfortable to wear once you put them in. They almost completely disappear and are barely noticeable after wearing them for just a couple minutes. They are extremely light which helps to make sure you don’t feel them in your ear and, they fit very securely. The sound is definitely enhanced and in the perfect setting, they are great as long as the volume isn’t set too high. 

I did however have a a few issues. There is a screeching noise when you are adjusting the settings and volume which was almost intolerable. The settings were easy to understand and adjust but there is barely any difference between the three different environment settings. They pick up radio frequencies in odd places. In a restroom with touchless faucets, there was a horrible popping noise along with static. 

Overall, these are decent hearing aids but could use a couple of extras to make them just that much better. For one, Bluetooth compatibility would allow adjustments via a users phone. It would make it easier to adjust on the fly in those situations where it helps to be inconspicuous."
89,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Easy and affordable!,"Easy to use right out of the box especially for a first time hearing aid user. I like that the hearing aids charge in the case. Overall I am very happy with this purchase, but I would have liked them better if they were beige, not black."
89,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Very Nice Hearing Experience,"Over the counter hearing aids are here. I have a good bit of hearing loss over the years and I can say with great confidence that these hearing aids do help tremendously. Going outdoors ushers in a symphony of new sounds (some wanted and unwanted). I only wish that they were a little more discrete when it comes down to color. One is red and one is blue and I assume that is so you know which ear to insert each ear piece in. As hearing aids aren't exactly the kind of tech that I want to show off, I would have liked to have seen more muted and natural colors like skin tones to help hide the ear pieces. The tops are black and are easily seen as well. The size is small enough to mostly hide the body of the ear piece in your ear and, like other hearing aids I've tried, there is a small plastic string to remove the ear piece safely when you're finished using them. I did have a small fitment issue but the kit includes different sized ear nibs to assist that. The batteries have lasted me all day and then some. I really appreciate the earpiece case charging by USB C. The case itself is well-made and seems very nice and capable of storing and protecting your hearing aids when not in use."
89,BestBuy,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,Basic Hearing Aids,"Context: I have not been medically diagnosed with hearing loss but have noticed that I do miss words from time to time.  I also tend to turn the TV up loud when I'm in my open living space (kitchen/living room), which is too much for my family.  I have spent over 20 years working various jobs where I constantly used the phone.

This hearing aid set is a very basic model.  There's not a lot that I found to review.  The unit has no app (at least, not that I could find) so it's not customizable.  The ear buds were comfortable to wear, however I had the same problem as I always have with ear buds is that my right ear doesn't hold them.  I have to hold my right ear because it tends to fall out.

When I was testing it, I tended to pick up more ambient (white) noise rather than actual words from my family in the next room (I have an office off my living room).  It may be my own heightened senses (I can become overloaded if I'm in a high sensory environment), but I found it distracting.  Maybe with more regular wear, I can overcome this."
89,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Great Affordable OTC Hearing Aids,"Go Hearing - Go Prime OTC Hearing Aids - Black

These Go Prime over the counter (OTC) hearing aids pack a lot of value into a small, affordable package. You get a pair of hearing aids, a wireless charging case and the needed charging cable and accessories. The included user manual can help get you up and running and there’s an included “Need Assistance” card with a Customer Support phone number in case you have any questions or need help in getting up and running.


They’re rechargeable and user-adjustable, using the built-in controls for the volume (8 settings) as well as for the pre-set programs (3 choices). That means that there’s no need for a phone app to control things. And they come in a rechargeable case where you can store and recharge your hearing aids at night when they’re not in use. The manufacturer states that the rechargeable case will provide 180 hours of use, and one charge of the hearing aids is supposed to last for up to 30 hours. That means you can go long stretches without having to worry about running out of battery power. And you can always recharge the case while you’re still wearing your hearing aids.


Since there are 24 possible combinations of the eight volume settings and three pre-set program choices, there is a bit of a learning curve to find out what sounds best to you. You’ll want to understand what pressing the control buttons do and what the different beeps mean. This learning and experimenting time is well spent, though, because the self-contained controls mean you can always adjust the settings wherever you are, depending on any changing situation. And once you have the hearing aids set the way you like them, any time you remove them from your ears and put them back in the recharging case, they retain the settings you previously chose the next time you use them.


Sometimes little things mean a lot, and I found that to be true here. Previously, with other hearing aids I’ve tested, it’s been hard to tell which of the two aids goes in which ear, since they both look the same. There was a very small “L” or “R” on each of the other aids, but unless you have perfect eyesight, you may need a magnifying glass to tell which is which. However, that’s not a problem with these hearing aids, since they were designed so it would be very easy to identify which aid went into each ear. The right aid is red (both start with “R”) and the left aid is blue. Kudos to whoever made that decision since it certainly makes using the devices so much easier.


Once I inserted both aids after tuning them as directed, I found I could turn the TV volume way down. In addition, I could hear sounds I didn’t even realize I was missing. So, they do work as designed to improve one’s hearing, and that’s the bottom line. And, with Best Buy’s flexible return program and the manufacturer’s one-year warranty, there’s no reason not to give these affordable OTC hearing aids a try. They could save you a lot while improving your hearing. That’s a win-win!"
89,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,GO HEARING - NICE ENTRY PRODUCT,"The GO HEARING – GO PRIME OTC HEARING AIDS are a nice product.  The ear buds are color coded to make recognition for ear insertion easily recognizable.  Another product I’ve used just had an “R” or “L” which was hard to see.

Small size that easily fits into ear and is relatively hidden.   The buds are a good size and easy to hold between thumb and index finger; I haven’t dropped one yet while preparing to insert in my ear.   The buds are comfortable and light-weight.   After wearing for the first time about an hour, I no longer noticed they were inserted.  

The charging case is a good size and easy to connect to a USB source.  Easy to insert and remove the buds.  The case is small enough to fit in a pocket and definitely in my purse, but large enough that it doesn’t get “lost” in my purse.   The bud’s battery held a charge very well … I never “ran out” while using them.

Package comes with everything you need to quickly get started using the hearing aids.   The settings were easy to use and adjust – even while inside my ear canal.

The noise reduction feature really helps to eliminate the background noise that is really irritating when trying to have a conversation in a crowded location, like a restaurant.  The sound quality was good enough for my slight hearing issue – which is mainly background noise in busy locations.

The one really great feature about the GO PRIME HEARING AID is that they are “ready to use” right out of the box.   No apps to download.  No time consuming “setup and customization” that is bothersome.  Another product I’ve tried took over an hour to setup with the app and then it still wasn’t right and I had to do over 2-3 more times before the buds working – together – correctly.   You won’t have that problem with the GO PRIME product.

The sound quality is not the best but for the price ($300) you can’t complain too much.

The real downside is that they are not Bluetooth compatible, so not easy to use with a phone.  I still need to use the phone’s “speaker” with these buds.

The user manual was extensive and extremely helpful.

For the price, these were really nice and useful hearing aids.  A little low on “features”, but again, you can’t beat the price if you have only a slight hearing loss.   I would recommend the GO PRIME HEARING AIDS to others that need a “starter” hearing aid with only a couple of features."
89,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,I am happy,It is a great help to be able.to purchase a hearing aid that didn't cost thousands of dollars...

89,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Buyer,"It takes a good deal of time and adjusting to reach proper fit and volume.  Once done, they work ok.  They're not $1500 aids, but they serve the purpose for the price."
89,BestBuy,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,Needs better audio quality,"I wanted to get excited about these hearing aids, however, I wasn't as impressed as I would have hoped. I have mild hearing loss in one ear and I fi d myself asking people to repeat things on a regular basis. When they arrived I was excited about the size. They truly are tiny and, once they are placed in the ear canal they are barely noticeable. They are relatively easy to insert and remove after a few tries to get in the groove of doing so. I like the charging care and the colors. The different colors help distinguish which earpiece fits into each ear. They also come with different size ear pieces that are interchangeable depending on the size of your ear canals. They do not support bluetooth connection for phone calls or music. These also produce the standard hearing aid feedback (loud squeal) when you mess with them. My largest gripe about these hearing aids is the audio quality. The volume gets PLENTY loud, but the quality was disappointing. Instead of the audio being pure, clean,  amplified sound, it was more like the audio was coming from a cheap set of loud earbuds. Maybe my expectations are a little high for a product like this one, but I wasn't overly impressed. I also found that pressing the buttons on the ear pieces while they were in the ear canal just made my ears uncomfortable. All in all, these could have had better audio quality."
89,BestBuy,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,Go Prime in The Ear Hearing Aid,Difficult to set volume and keeps clogging up. Wouldn't have bought it if I'd known this before.
89,BestBuy,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,"Background hum, no intelligent signal processing","In the box:
•	Left & Right hearing aids;
•	Charging case;
•	USB (A to C) charging cable;
•	1.0A 5.0W power adapter;
•	3 pair tips (small, medium, & large);
•	4 spare wax guards;
•	1 cleaning brush;

No smartphone app required. This may or may not be an advantage depending on your personal preference.

There are three listening programs, normal, high-frequency, and low-frequency. Each hearing aid is adjusted separately using the button near the microphone. A long press on the button changes the listening program. Within each listening program, there are 8 listing volumes. A short press on the button cycles through the volume levels.

The hearing aids are easy to insert and remove using the pull-wire. I found them physically comfortable. However, they generate a loud screech (feedback) when anything gets close to the microphone. This is impossible to avoid when inserting and removing, but also happens when resting on a pillow and using a phone.

I could not tell a lot of difference between the normal, high-, and low-frequency programs. All three amplified surround sounds considerably at the lowest volume setting, particularly high frequencies. They were exquisitely sensitive to sounds in the immediate vicinity (e.g., my own footsteps, pant seams, keyboard, and the click of the lid on the carrying case). There was also a notable hiss when no ambient sound was present. Due to the acoustical issues, I was unable to tolerate them for more than an hour and only when sitting still and watching TV.

The only signal processing appears to be high and low frequency filtering. Human speech does not seem to be selectively enhanced. Any sound that makes it past the frequency filter is amplified regardless of whether it is speech, music, or just background noise.

Pros: Easy insertion and setup, physically comfortable;

Cons: Excessive feedback, background hum, no intelligent signal processing;"

The longer I had them, the less I liked the results. 
1. Each bud has a button to adjust the volume. The left has a button near the top and the right near the bottom.  Confusing.  They can be difficult to find and operate.
To control the volume, you must cycle through all the levels which can really hurt. Also, since the antenna sticks out more than the volume button, I ended up having to fiddle with it.
2. Unfortunately, the hearing aids did not help at all with people talking.  I ended up listening to miscellaneous noise while trying to hear the person in front of me.
3. I did not find them uncomfortable, but they had a tendency to loosen while wearing them.

My hearing loss is moderate with the loss at both the top and bottom of the range. For me, I was just as well off using earbuds with the tv as the hearing aids did not really help me with anything else."
89,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Go Hearing - A New Day for Aids,"My ENT medical doctor has been wanting me to consider hearing aids since my hearing began to fade with a medical condition that I experienced in 2021. I have not really been ready for anything that he has shown me with either its size or price. I have tried a few inexpensive amplifiers that either become annoying with their size in a short time of use or have so much static that using them is more annoying than the little bit of hearing loss that I have. The history of the majority of middle-aged people obtaining hearing aids in America has just been difficult and the medical profession is finally admitting that depriving people of hearing aids has led to increased dementia cases and the speed to which the onset of dementia occurs. 

So finally, something remarkable has just happened that should have happened decades ago. The USA government has encouraged the FDA to make Hearing Aids marketable over the counter (OTC). Making Hearing Aids only obtainable through medical facilities as they have always been until the last couple of months of 2022 made the average price $4,500-6,800 dollars. It also limited the competition of applying newer technology towards making better options and the way the distribution was set up through the doctors and the mark-up that was on the product didn’t challenge manufacturers to be creative in making a better product. I know because I went through this with my father, and then (bless his heart) he would never wear them because he had to go to long without them. 

With much enthusiasm for myself and many others with low to moderate hearing loss I would like to report that I have just evaluated an OTC Hearing Aid that is small, fits in the ear instead of wrapping around and hanging on the ear, has a rechargeable case that can charge it up to 6x, and works very well. The Hearing Aids can be used for up to 30 hours on a single charge! The GO Prime Hearing Aid manufactured by Go Hearing is very impressive in its design, size, retail price, and functionality. 

At first, I wasn’t sure that these were going to have the clarity in sound that I wanted because they had a lot of static.  The GO PRIME version that I have are designed with a small button on each that can be push for each of 3 different listening programs (Normal, High-Frequency, and Low-Frequency) with each having eight different volume adjustments.  The trick to getting these to work great is to try to use them in different settings and adjust them accordingly.  I used them in several setting but particularly watching TV, in the car listening to the radio, and on virtual meetings.  After about 6 days, I had them adjusted to where I just left them alone and totally quit touching the control on either one of them at all.  They are designed that when you put them in the case, they stay the way that they last were, and so when they are taken out of the case they are as they were when last used.  I have had no screeching noises, no static, or any annoying sounds, just amplified sound like my hearing was before the illness two years ago. I am very pleased with these, but it did take persistence and use in different situations to fine tune them to my particular hearing needs. I think I have ended up with a High-Frequency in the right ear and adjusted the volume mid-range and Normal in the left ear, but I just kept fine tuning them until my hearing was very comfortable in my main environments. 

They also have to be comfortable in the ear and they come with 3 sizes of ear cushions – small, medium, and large.  I found that small worked best for me and the hearing aid stayed in my ear when inserted. It was also pretty comfortable, but if I feel I need to give my ears a break, I carry the recharging case with me and slip them in their respective slots for a while. 

I do wish the colors on them were a little more subtle.  Red is prominent for the Right hearing aid and Blue is the color for the Left hearing aid.  I wish they were maybe a dark shade of gray and a lighter shade of gray so that they wouldn’t be quite so noticeable with short hair. 

After extensively studying Hearing Aids for the last 18 years and knowing what isn’t obtainable and the cost of what has been obtainable that has often been very technologically outdated, I am going to give these hearing aids five stars.  Even though these could use a few little tweaks towards improvement in color, etc. they are a magnificent step in the right direction and appropriately named – Go Hearing. Yes, I definitely recommend these for low to moderate hearing loss and wish this manufacturer much success. I appreciate them providing a quality product for a reasonable price."
89,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Reliable and good fitting over the counter hearing,"I was excited to get these because over time and from my past in the military and playing in various bands when I was in high school has probably affected my hearing quite a bit. I also have a mild case of tinnitus that is fairly manageable.

I’ve found that I am asking people to repeat themselves through the day and now that I’m conscious of it I’ve gotten pretty annoyed with myself.

It was recommended to me that I should get one of the new sets of over the counter hearing aids so I was stoked to get these GoHearing buds. These seem to be using Siemens tech and have a similar build so I wouldn’t be surprised if they are a third-party branding of that build.

These seem to work pretty well. There are three programs. A regular program, a treble boost program, and a bass boost program. I’ve tried them all and found the regular one to work best for me.

I really like how these are so small. They are definitely still noticeable, but they are less noticeable. I have a benefit from the culture accepting people wearing earbuds all the time, and these are so much smaller, I’m not sure anyone would really notice them. They are not “flesh” colored so if someone looks at your ears, they are going to be obvious. 

The sound from these aids is definitely amplified. The best way for me to describe how I felt with them is that I thought everything sounded crisper and easier. I didn’t feel so much strain, and I didn’t need to “pay close attention.” If you’re losing your hearing, you know what I mean. There’s some freedom in this.

For the most part, they are comfortable, and you really do need to stick them far into your ears and size them right with the included ear cups or you might get a little feedback. And, that’s my issue with them when I’m putting them in and taking them out. It can get a little noisy and feedbacky, so I would recommend keeping them on the lowest volume when putting in and out so that you don’t have to blast your ears.

And that’s my biggest issue with these aids. The volume is controlled with a single button that has three stages of loudness for each of three programs. To increase the volume is easy with a button press. If you fumble you can get too loud then have to press the button over and over again until you get back to the program you wanted and volume you wanted. This can be bad, but fortunately there’s a minor delay before it starts to pipe the sound into your ears. The buds are fairly small so without some kind of touch sensitivity I’m not sure how they would put in a reduce volume button.

It's fairly easy to take them out because of a plastic cord that juts out of the side. When I was trying to get the fit right, the cord stuck my ear quite a bit and tickled the inside of my ears. It was uncomfortable but adjusting made it better.

There’s another “lite” version of this set that requires a small screwdriver to handle the volume. I’m not sure if that’s better or worse. I will say that I’m lucky that I was happy with the first setting on the first program because pressing the button is the worst part of this experience.

Before I put in this review, I wore them continuously for a week and they didn’t feel any different from wearing a set of high quality earbuds. At night my ears were sore but after 4 days I didn’t feel that way anymore. The batteries definitely lasted all of my workday and they charged pretty quickly after putting them in the charging case. 

If you don’t want to go all the way and get a couple thousand dollar prescription hearing aids, maybe try these out."

The first thing that came to my mind when receiving my Go Prime hearing aids was the question of what am I going to get for my money. I thought this considering that the price tag is about one-quarter of the standard cost of a set of hearing aids. I have thoroughly tested the Go Prime hearing aids and have also been able to compare them to the ambient noise feature that my Galaxy Buds Pro earbuds have built in. The ambient noise feature uses the microphones to boost the sound around you similar to what a set of hearing aids do. With that in mind I will now proceed to elaborate on my experience with the Go Prime OTC’s and explain how and what would make them a success. The first thing I noticed was the good build quality of the Go Prime Hearing aids and the case. They also come with all of the accessories that you need to clean and adjust hearing settings as well as three sets of earbuds to get the proper fit for you. I first used the Go Primes as is after charging them without changing any settings. After wearing them for a while like this I did get amplified sound however I also got a lot of unwanted sounds. While this is hard to explain what it made me feel like is that the Go Primes needed noise canceling to eliminate unwanted background noises and reduce the loudness of my own voice. The good news is after adjusting the volume level for each hearing aid I was able to eliminate that issue which is best described as hearing your own voice in your head. Once I went through the different volume levels and found the optimal setting the problem went away and a suddenly I had clear super sonic hearing. I mean my bearing was so good I could hear my dog walk into the room. I am talking you could hear the footsteps of my little 14lb dog on the carpet! Amazing! While I have found 5 to be the maximum volume level for the most sound without clipping or reverb inside your head. I really believe for everyday use I should turn it down to 4 or 3 even. Will just have to experiment more. I will tell you right now though I am very impressed that the settings were able to do such a terrific job of fine-tuning. So I can turn it up to five when I want supersonic James Bond spy hearing or lower it down to 3 or 4 for everyday normal use. Each Earbud hearing aid can be totally adjusted individually and they are very comfortable to wear all day. You will forget they are there and they are very discreet and easily covered with hair for most women's style haircuts. Now on to improvements. I really think that an app with Bluetooth pairing to the hearing aids would allow you to really fine-tune these Hearing aids. With an app the ease of use and sound adjustment possibilities would make these Go Prime Hearing aids a number one hit the app were done right with all of the proper fine sound tuning available. You could use WI-FI direct or a proprietary connection frequency to avoid interference. Additionally, you could just pair the Go Primes with Bluetooth to make the tuning adjustments and then turn off the Bluetooth so you would not have to worry about outside interference. These things are a great start and a good product at the price point. I just say they use some creativity and put a couple of app developers on the team to write some apps for endless possibilities in sound tuning that would put the Go-Primes at the top of the pack in the OTC hearing aid market! If you or your loved one needs some good hearing aids at a great price compared to conventional overpriced ugly hearing aids go pick some GO Prime OTC Hearing Aids up! You and your familiy will be glad you did! Great product with even greater potential for next-level improvements on the next models!"
89,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Affordable OTC hearing aids,"The Go Hearing Go Prime OTC Hearing Aids are well made, fairly lightweight so they are not uncomfortable to wear.  They come in a well designed compact charging case that has a USB-C connector, cable and they even include the charger, which is a nice bonus.  They also come with three different size silicone ear tips to accommodate most ear canal sizes. The medium tips are pre-installed and so far fit pretty well.  At first I was a bit weary of these being called Hearing Aids, as I have tried similarly priced Hearing Amplifiers from other vendors that were just not usable because of the constant squealing feedback sounds.  Not so with the Go Hearing Prime OTC - they actually work as intended.  There is some feedback when you insert them in or remove them from your ears, but it’s very tolerable and short lived.  One side effect of that is basically having to use any phone in speakerphone mode, because if you put it to your ear you are very likely to get high pitch feedback from these hearing aids.  The most confusing part is the volume adjustment and program settings that have to be done with very delicate fingers by pressing the little tip/switch on the back side of these earbuds.  The confusion is mostly based on the manual instructions that are written for 2 different models, so make sure you read the instructions for the model you have, in this case the Go Prime (not Go Lite).  Ended up starting off with the default/Normal program, lowest volume setting and working up from there.  To me they sound a bit high on trebles and also seem to amplify my own voice a bit too much.  It will take some time getting used to these just like any hearings aids or even bluetooth earbuds, but at this price point, they would make a fine, very affordable hearing aid for many folks with reduced hearing capabilities due to age (please make your own assessment and/or check with your doctor, as this is just my opinion)"
89,BestBuy,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,Does what it promises but with some quirks,"I got the Go Hearing Go Prime OTC Hearing Aids, because I felt like I’ve noticed some hearing loss in my left ear recently where I've had trouble hearing people who talk to me on my left side. Though I have not been diagnosed with any hearing loss from a doctor, I thought I would give this product a shot. Right out of the box these are ready to go with a charge, setup is fairly straightforward in that you put the buds in your ears and you're ready to go. They are color coordinated with red being right and blue being left so there should be no confusion in putting these in. The ear buds fit very comfortably in my ears but found the volume adjust button to be annoying to change where the button location is flipped flopped on the other earbud, so that was hard at first to figure out. And the instruction says there is a tool to change the volume, but it's a generic manual for all of Go-Hearing hearing devices, so I spent a couple minutes poking the buds with the tip cleaner by accident. (I recommend they have specific manuals for each product.)
I can say that these did increase my ability to hear better out of my left ear but I could never get used to wearing these when I would interact with people and then having to hear my voice which would sound robotic and would take me out of the conversation and would have to take them out. I also would have issues with static interference when I would put my phone up to my ear to take a call which made it so that I would have to take every call on speaker phone while using it to avoid the static noise. Overall I think this product does what it says it will do in that you will be able to hear better but with some trade offs with static noise and your voice sounding like a robot."
89,BestBuy,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,Comfortable and easy to use hearing aids,"These hearing aids have a very long lasting battery, which will likely not run out of battery power, before they can be charged at night while sleeping. 

These hearing aids have plenty of sound amplification on the highest volume.

The left earpiece is blue and the right earpiece is red, this is a nice touch.

These hearing aids have a built in automatic volume reduction functionality, for the times when noises are a bit too loud, this prevents the loud noises from being amplified to the point of being too loud. 

If someone has a minimum or medium hearing loss, these GoPrime hearing aids should be sufficient at amplifying sound to the point of allowing an improved level of hearing.

I wear a pair of Bluetooth earbuds all the time, and I have a process of taking a single piece of two ply tissue paper, and I separate it into two thinner pieces of tissue paper, I take one of the thinner pieces and fold it, and then wrap the folded tissue paper around my earbuds, and I wear them with sort of an earbud sock. This thin layer of tissue paper absorbs oils and waxes that develop in the ear, and it keeps earbuds quite clean, and this prevents the necessity of frequently having to wipe earbuds clean. This same protective layer of tissue paper can be used with these hearing aids, and any ear wax will be absorbed by the tissue paper.

Because of the fact that I use Bluetooth earbuds all the time, it is kind of an unavoidable inclination to compare these hearing aids, to the sound producing capabilities of a comparably priced pair of Bluetooth earbuds. Considering that all Bluetooth earbuds have a built in wireless Bluetooth technology, which these hearing aids do not have, it kind of feels like Bluetooth earbuds, have a more technologically advanced built in technology, compared to most hearing aids. That consideration naturally would cause the customer to wonder why hearing aids on average, would be more expensive than Bluetooth earbuds? Whatever happened to the law of supply and demand?

I am rating these GoPrime hearing aids on two separate scales. In a world where Bluetooth earbuds, which contains the advanced wireless Bluetooth technology, was not available as a sound product in a similar form factor, then in that world, I would rate these hearing aids at 5 out of 5 stars. Since we are living in a world having advanced Bluetooth earbuds, then this causes an inclination to rate these hearing aids, at 3 out of 5 stars."
89,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Impressive effective hearing assist. Bats beware.,"Go Hearing - Go Prime OTC Hearing Aids. Go Hearing’s OTC aid keeps its focus on delivering sound amplification with a fairly simple set of earbuds. Hearing improvement is as immediate as charging up the case, allowing the case to charge the enclosed earbuds, and then inserting the earbuds into my ear canals. I could hear the highly amplified shuffling of pages in the small USER MANUAL in my hands.  I’m pretty sure I would have heard a fly’s wings if one had passed nearby. These work as intended, even before I dove into the settings to achieve some customization.

SETUP: Before I dive into getting these Go Hearing setup to use, I’d like to draw attention to the need to be patient with these devices and yourself. These seemed too sensitive at first. Even this somewhat simple set of features (volume settings and programs) can seem a bit overwhelming and hard to control. Don’t ry to change too much, or anything at first. These ear buds, and probably other brands, soon become familiar and comfortable.

It really takes only a few hours of fully charging the case with the enclosed earbuds to get ready for all day use (30 hours specified). The “DOMES” already attached to the ear buds appear to be medium size, with two more sets for small or larger ear canals. I didn’t test the other sizes yet, but they appear to pull off and re-attach like most other modern earbuds. Just be sure to fully force them onto their posts during replacement. 

I discovered that the fit necessary for effective use of the Go Prime earbuds was not terribly fussy. These amplify with few extraneous artifact noises with the already attached medium “domes”. Each ear piece is brightly colored with either a RED or BLUE band clearly marked R for right and L for left. Those colored bands are not visible once the ear buds are inserted. In fact, these earbuds are barely visible because the device is very small and sets deeper into the ear than typical earbuds. No worry however, because there is a nearly invisible pull wire to retrieve them from your ear canals. 

The Go Hearing has individual VOLUME controls for each ear, There are a number of levels (the user manual indicates 8), accessed by quick, distinct presses on the raised VOLUME/PROGRAM button. The instructions confuse the issue by referencing an adjustment tool, but that is NOT an option and appears to refer to a different model, entirely. 

This same VOLUME/PROGRAM button allows the end user to cycle through 3 different preset equalization programs. However, the process requires the end user to hold down the button for 3-4 seconds. The programs are offered in succession: The first is NORMAL, accompanied by 1 beep, and addresses amplification across the broadest sound spectrum. The second is HIGH FREQUENCY, accompanied by 2 beeps, and seems to boost the treble region mostly. The 3rd is LOW FREQUENCY, accompanied by 3 beeps, and boost the lower bass region of sounds. Another 3-4 second press brings you back to the normal program.

I WISH: The use of beeps for both volume confirmation and program change is only slightly helpful, and leaves me still confused. Is it that difficult to use a digital voice so users don’t lose their bearings while making setting changes? And that odd asymmetrical orientation of the volume control, differing from left to right seems unnecessary and eventually correctable.   

PERFORMANCE / SUMMARY: Go Hearing - Go Prime receives a round of applause from me. These ear buds are super small and discreet, These ear buds have limited design goals and a corresponding limited set of features. And they all work quite nicely. Using these while viewing/listening to TV provided an immediate increase in volume across the entire sound spectrum. There were few noise artifacts. Feedback noises were strictly limited to those times I let my hands linger too closely to my ears while making adjustments. For those times when the TV was too loud during dramatic excesses, it was just easier to pull the ear buds from my ears. and place them back in afterwards. I would not describe the sound shaping quality as subtle or sublime. These are a blunt amplification tool, but they sure do that work quite well. If I over-do the amplification, I’m competing with bats. 

These are not difficult to manage. Knowing they have a lengthy operating time between charges and no replacement batteries was reassuring. They operate for long stretches of time and are fully (lithium battery) rechargeable from a very small case. There is no software and no App. There is no hearing test. The ear buds are only about amplifying sound. They provide a variable volume control operated using a push button feature that quickly and easily modifies sound level.  There is no advanced, sophisticated analysis of your hearing frequency curves. But, there are 3 presets that offer a way to address a broader range of inadequacies. Use them or not, the amplification itself will address some hearing issues, The 3 program settings provide a simple tool for limited tuning for specific issues. I like these OTC hearing aids. Easy to recommend."
89,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Great OTC hearing aids at great price point,"I have worn prescription hearing aids for about four years and was intrigued with hearing aids going OTC this year. The Go Hearing aids exceeded my expectations! I have moderate hearing loss and am not 'missing' a lot of audio ranges, but mostly have muffled hearing.... my current prescription aids are the over the ear type and quite complicated to use at times.

Unpacking the box, I was pleased to find a simple, and complete, user manual.  The aids are stored in a small case, just like bluetooth ear buds you might connect to your phone. The magnetically snap into the charging slots and there is a cover. Red is right.... blue is left. The case also serves as a backup charger, which is great for on the go people. 

This is a complete set with cleaning tools and extra wax guards and I encourage anyone using these to clean the tips frequently with the tool provided. This keeps the sound channels open. They are so easy to pop in and out! Oh, and they turn on automatically when taken out of the charging case. No fumbling around trying to hit a small button or wheel. 

When I first put the aid in my right ear, I heard quite a bit of sound feedback, but it goes away as soon as you stop touching it. The Go Prime has one adjustment button and one 'handle' on each aid. Pushing the button in short one second taps will send the volume up until you max out at 8 level, then send it back to one. I suggest putting it a minimum volume when you start. If you hold the little button for over three seconds, it will change mode, from normal to high-frequency to low-frequency. The user manual gives good descriptions of these. I suggest starting with Normal.

Like any hearing aid, start slow and build up your daily hours. If you have never worn aids, you will be shocked at what you were missing! I was quite pleasantly surprised by these aids. first, they fit snugly in my ear canal and did not feel like they would fall out. Second, they did amplify and clarify spoken words for me, which is my hearing problem. I feel better able to understand speech when I cannot see the person speaking. Third, the convenience of having a small charging case, that also charges when not plugged in, makes these handy to carry around. I work on a farm, mostly alone, and do not normally where aids outside. Having these in my pocket would be grand for times I and talking with a person in the field. 

Overall, for the price, these hearing aids exceeded my expectations. For me, they clarified speech and allowed me to up the volume a bit."
89,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Comfortable and accurate!,"For context, I do not wear hearing aids but my grandmother does and this review is based on her reported experience with the product.

For years, my grandmother had hearing problems. We were told it is simply a function of aging. She has tried various hearing aids prescribed from her doctor, none were very comfortable, a few had pitch problems, and a few had difficulty with static, etc. 

I'm not saying this product is perfect, but for the price and the fact that it's over the counter, it is a very compelling deal. These are modern, with fitted replaceable silicone covers (3 of them), it lasts 30 hours, doesn't have the feedback problem when pulling out, tied to your phone and you can adjust the functions on your phone, and does an amazing job with background noise control. I am told she's never experienced anything like this before. There's a button that has multiple functions, equalizer/volume/profile control, she loves it. She will admit it's a little confusing for her at times, she forgets that she has this function/ability sometimes, but in the right setting feels they are a very rewarding feature.

Comes with a rechargeable case, with an updated USB-C port for quick charge. This has been a god-send for her. Going on vacation is a simple plug and good to go. Just having this feature has been reassuring for her to be traveling anywhere."
89,BestBuy,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,"Great Fit & Usability, But Short-Lived Durability","I recently purchased this product for my Dad, and his experience has been mixed. 

Good Fit: The design is excellent. It fits comfortably and securely, which made it perfect for daily use.

Easy to Use: Setting it up was a breeze. 

Decent Voice Quality: The voice quality is satisfactory. While it’s not outstanding, it does the job adequately for most tasks.

Stopped Working Within 2 Weeks: Unfortunately, his positive experience was cut short. The product stopped working within just two weeks of use, which was quite disappointing.

Overall, while the product shows promise with its comfortable fit, ease of use, and decent voice quality, the lack of durability is a significant drawback."

89,BestBuy,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,A massive step backwards from prescription devices,"My bias: I have congenital moderate hearing loss and have worn hearing aids for nearly 40 years. I've been wearing In-The-Ear (ITE) devices similar in size to this for most of that time.

I was hoping these would work as a back-up pair I could use if my prescription devices broke. I only intended to use them for a week or two as needed. I found them intolerable even for short use, however.

The fit was, obviously, never going to be as good as prescription devices, which are custom molded. Even so, I found them irritating and not really secure regardless of which mold I tried.

Because the fit is loose, pressing the volume/program button is not consistently repeatable.

Sound quality is bad. They sound like the analog hearing aids I wore 25 years ago: tinny and unnatural. Like a long distance phone call in the 1980s.

Feedback suppression is bad. This has 8 levels of volume, but anything past 4 was full of feedback. And again, I tried all three ear molds."

•	Left & Right hearing aids;
•	Charging case;
•	USB (A to C) charging cable;
•	1.0A 5.0W power adapter;
•	3 pair tips (small, medium, & large);
•	4 spare wax guards;
•	1 cleaning brush;

No smartphone app required. This may or may not be an advantage depending on your personal preference.

There are three listening programs, normal, high-frequency, and low-frequency. Each hearing aid is adjusted separately using the button near the microphone. A long press on the button changes the listening program. Within each listening program, there are 8 listing volumes. A short press on the button cycles through the volume levels.

The hearing aids are easy to insert and remove using the pull-wire. I found them physically comfortable. However, they generate a loud screech (feedback) when anything gets close to the microphone. This is impossible to avoid when inserting and removing, but also happens when resting on a pillow and using a phone.

I could not tell a lot of difference between the normal, high-, and low-frequency programs. All three amplified surround sounds considerably at the lowest volume setting, particularly high frequencies. They were exquisitely sensitive to sounds in the immediate vicinity (e.g., my own footsteps, pant seams, keyboard, and the click of the lid on the carrying case). There was also a notable hiss when no ambient sound was present. Due to the acoustical issues, I was unable to tolerate them for more than an hour and only when sitting still and watching TV.

The only signal processing appears to be high and low frequency filtering. Human speech does not seem to be selectively enhanced. Any sound that makes it past the frequency filter is amplified regardless of whether it is speech, music, or just background noise.

Comfortability - Fits in my ears very comfortably.  Doesn't make my ears hurt or ache after a full day in my ears.  Very small footprint easy to place in my ears and to pull them back out at the end of they.

Performance - Lots of echoing and background noise when I walk or move my hands.  It's like more of amplification than trying to tune into voices or use clarifying technologies to zoom in on conversations.

The recharability aspect is really nice.  I was hoping these would work really well so I could just put them in the case overnight and charge them.

Case quality is very durable and I like the black it doesn't show fingerprints or dirt.  I am not a fan of light colored cases for such items.

I would say that these aren't terrible but definitely not as good as others I have tried.  Not a lot of ability to fine tune or tweak these.

118,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Pretty darn good...,"The Sennheiser - All-Day Clear Slim - OTC Self-Fitting Hearing Aids have been…well, they’ve been a blessing.  To be able to hear more in a social setting is wonderful.  I’m using the phrase, “I’m sorry, what?” much less.  I appreciate that.  My family appreciates that.

The All-Day Clear Slims, like any hearing device, will take some time to get used to.  Incoming sound/voices seem to have a bit of a ‘canned’ quality.  I figure that’s going to take time for my brain to work out — and for me to fine tune as time goes on.  One thing that has made this experience much easier to deal with is the setup and controlling capabilities of the All-Day Clear mobile app.  It was one of the least tedious, easy setups that I have experienced with OTC hearing aids.  Thank you, Sennheiser.

Over time, I can only imagine that I’ll be using the app less and less.  Right now, it’s great to have total command as I continue to become familiar with them.  I can fine tune balance, volume, and tone (with an EQ) in either a split fashion, or both left and right together.  My set has two sound settings — Automatic, which seems to adjust incoming sound based upon your surroundings (like in a constantly changing social setting), and what Sennheiser calls the Live Music setting.  This setting seems to take everything in just as it is.  I have found myself having the Automatic setting on during most of the day.  When I’m relaxing in the evening and watching the TV or a movie, I prefer the Live Music setting…fewer sounds/voices dropping out and then returning.  Everything seems to stay more constant.  This is all kind of hard to explain.  You need to experience it yourself.

There are a couple things I wish were different —  

I wish the charging case had an internal battery to charge the aids overnight.  As it is, the case does need to be plugged in via USB-C.

I wish the receiver buds were tan or semi-translucent instead of black.  Less noticeable.

I wish the connective wire from the main body to the ear bud was just a tad bit longer — but that’s just the ‘design’ of my earlobe.

Even with all this in mind, these are darn good hearing aids.  Try ‘em out.  You’ll want to check with Sennheiser, but I believe that they offer a 30-day trial period…and with these, you don’t have to buy any hearing aid batteries ever again!"
118,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,I like this product,"I recently had the opportunity to try the Sennheiser All Day Clear Slim product and I am happy to share my positive review about it. First of all, I must highlight the exceptional sound quality it offers. The bass is deep and powerful, while the treble is clear and precise, providing a most enjoyable listening experience. Plus, its slim, sleek design makes it very comfortable to wear throughout the day, without putting undue pressure on my ears. I'm also impressed with the battery life, which allows for extended use without having to worry about constantly recharging. Finally, I appreciate the noise reduction feature, which allows me to fully enjoy my music by filtering out external distractions. In short, the Sennheiser All Day Clear Slim product is a perfect choice for all women wishing to combine style, comfort and exceptional sound quality."

Sennheiser - All-Day Clear Slim - OTC Self-Fitting Hearing Aid

I was looking for three main features in an OTC hearing aid: rechargeable, Bluetooth connectivity, and quality of sound. I found them all in these hearing aids. Sennheiser is world famous for their audio products, so I was banking on them putting their name on these *only* if they met strict quality standards. I was not disappointed. 

They’re light weight and easy to handle. Since they have a behind-the-ear component, the portion that goes into your ear is small and comfortable. The part that goes behind your ear is nearly invisible and has simple controls for changing volume and taking phone calls. The connecting wire is soft, but bendable and makes it easy to fit the aids to your liking. They feel secure, but with their open air design, not like some aids that feel stuffed in your ears. Also, they come with three earpiece sizes to fit each ear nicely.

Connecting the aids to your phone is easy with the app, which is also very straightforward. Once paired, a simple hearing preference test locks in your settings until you want to change them. The Bluetooth connectivity lets you listen to music (with quite nice sound quality!) or make and take phone calls. It’s important to note that the 16 hour battery life pertains to using the aids for hearing assistance, but using Bluetooth will only give you a few hours of battery life.

Charging the aids is easy with the enclosed charging case. Red, yellow and green indicators keep you up to date on charging progress. Taking the aids out of the charger turns them on and connects them to your phone. The app lets you adjust the overall volume or set it separately for each ear. You can fine tune the equalization with bass, mid tone, and treble sliders. Audio signals let you know when the batteries are running low.

Finally, due to their construction, sound is enhanced without sounding “canned” or artificial. The mixture of sound traveling directly to your ears combined with the amplified sound comes across as very natural."
118,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,i like this hearing aid,"I have to say that I am really impressed with the Sennheiser All Day Clear Slim product. With my regular small hearing losses, it is often difficult for me to fully enjoy my favorite music or follow a conversation clearly. However, since I started using this headset, my life has really changed. Its thin and lightweight design makes it extremely comfortable to wear all day, without any discomfort. Additionally, the exceptional sound clarity I get from these headphones is simply amazing. The bass is powerful and deep, and the highs are clear and crisp. Even when I'm in a noisy environment, the headphones manage to filter out the noise and give me a great hearing experience. I am truly grateful to have discovered the Sennheiser All Day Clear Slim, as it has improved my quality of life significantly. I highly recommend it to anyone with hearing problems as it really does make a huge difference."
118,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,VERY WELL MADE!,"I have been looking at OTC hearing aids for a while, I am a retired police officer.  And for 20 years I was a firearms instructor, the majority of that time I only used the soft foam, moldable in ear hearing protection.  Now I’m paying the price, my hearing is not what it used to be.  

I first off want to mention how well these are packaged by Sennheiser, the outer box was a mess, it looked as if it had been crushed and I was worried about the product inside.  But once I opened it and removed the inner box I realized they were not, due to the fact that Sennheiser put forth a lot of effort in packaging these hearing aids.  JOB WELL DONE1

Before I received these I downloaded the All-Day Clear app and registered for a new account.  When they arrived I was surprised that they were 77% charged. The initial setup w/ the app and the hearing aids was very easy.  It took about 2-3 minutes and I had them connected to my phone by bluetooth.  I took the time to try on the included soft, gel tips to find just the right fit for me.  I settled on the medium in my left ear and the small in my right.  My problem is that no matter what I do, whether its w/ these Sennheiser All-Day Clear Slim fearing aids or just in-ear headphones, God made my right ear different from the left as far as the canal is concerned.  My point is I never have a problem w/ my left ear, but my right ear after about an hour or so, I begin to experience ear fatigue.  And it gets to the point that I have to remove it.  It was the same w/ these.  That is no fault of the company, it’s just me.

As far as the product, its is VERY well made!  These are lightweight, that was the first thing that I noticed when I removed them from the case.  My wife and I rode our golf cart after I had the tips on and the hearing aids wire adjusted.  I chose the wind noise reduction setting, but I still had a lot of wind noise in both ears, not a big deal but it was noticeable.  When we arrived at home my wife was doing laundry and I was reading/listening to the television.  And I had the volume set to what I “normally” have it set on and immediately I had to turn it down.  I realized then that I really need hearing aids.  I was amazed, because I could hear.  My wife came out of the laundry room and asked why I turned the volume down and I told her that it was a bit overwhelming.  And it was/is.  I was hearing “noises” I had been missing.  I was shocked to hear the water discharging from the washing machine, I had never heard that.  I heard my wife running water in the kitchen sin, again, I hadn’t heard that.  And then, the ear pain started and I removed them for the night and charged them.  I went to Church the next morning and I was pleasantly surprised how well I could hear, again, I heard sounds, noises, voices, etc., that I hadn’t been used to hearing.  And the adjustability on the app makes fine tuning these to fit your need and surroundings so simple.  JOB WELL DONE!

The fit, other than my right ear is great.  No one has noticed (if they have they haven’t mentioned it) that I have these in.  They are sleek and when Sennheiser says “Slim” they aren’t kidding.  I was pleased how well they stayed in and allowed me to hear again.  Take the time to mold the wire to fit around the front part of the ear and they are truly not very noticeable.  The soft case that Sennheiser includes in the package is a great benefit for me, I put it in my pocket and when the ear fatigue starts I will take them out, I’ve tried leaving the left hearing aid in, but its hard to explain but I just don’t like the results, its as if I’m turning my head to the right to compensate and it becomes overwhelming.  My hope is that the more I wear these and get more accustomed to that “overwhelming” feeling that my ear fatigue will go away.  Because these Sennheiser All-Day Clear Slim have opened my eyes to how much I had lost in my hearing.

End of the day mom loves them! she admitted she did not realiuze quite how far her hearing loss became. The conversations have been more engaging and theTV/music from the basement has almost dissapeared.

I wouldreccomend them to a friend!"
118,BestBuy,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,Can you hear me clearly and cleanly now?,"This hearing aid, available over the counter and without prescription, will improve the lifestyle of someone with mild to moderate hearing loss, but not as well as many speciality hearing aids available through an audiologist. Miniaturization in technology continues to improve and I was hoping that this could be a breakthrough product to help more people to engage in the world more comfortably. Unfortunately, it’s not quite there yet.

Set up:
Sennheiser requires installing their ‘All-Day Clear’ app to your phone for set up. This is used to create a sound profile. Unfortunately, the app crashed once (after 10 minutes ‘pending’), which made the set up take longer. On the second attempt, the aids were set up properly. Another annoyance was a warning to see a professional when I set the left gain higher than the right gain. I’d been to an audiologist in the past and know that my hearing is worse on the left side. I don’t need Sennheiser to remind me of that!

After using it for a couple of hours, I wanted to tweak some of the settings to make certain situations easier to deal with. Unfortunately, the app required me to set up the hearing aids again from scratch in order to ‘Update’ the settings. I had to write down what the settings were initially so I could have a reference point from which to work. It certainly would have been simpler to be able to tweak the settings directly instead of having to remember or write it down.

Appearance:
It was pointed out to me that the black backing to the ear buds was very visible in my ears, along with the wire heading to the ear bud from the outside portion. While hearing loss is not something to be embarrassed about, I’m not keen on how clearly this pair highlights itself to showcase that I’m wearing something. While I was out and about, I did hear someone say they through I was wearing ear buds, which was odd for someone my age.

Usage (TV / Computer / Phone):
After a couple of attempts, I was able to connect the hearing aids to my computer. At first, it did not appear in the list of bluetooth devices. After putting the hearing aids back in the case, then taking them out again, they conencted. Once connected, the sound quality was decent and clear from the PC. I also tried to connect the ‘TV mode’ on the hearing aid to my TV. I have an external bluetooth adapter for the TV, which is driven from the optical audio out. I’ve used this witth a personal surround speaker from Sony (great product) and which had been a godsend for allowing me to raise the volume for myself without disburbing those around me. I was hoping the adapter would connect to the hearing aids, but it did not. 

Connecting to phone audio was easier in some ways. I was able to get music playing through the hearing aids and they sounded as good as the computer with decent frequency range. Howver, when I got a call, I wasn’t able to get that to connect directly. I ended up using the speakerphone on my cell or my caller wasn’t able to hear me.

Usage (Conversation):
Sennhieser has done a decent job of rejecting ambient noise and focusing on a close conversation. It was certainly a big improvement over not using anything (and my shouting to others as I coudn’t hear myself). From talking to others about their experience, however, they’ve noted useful features on their hearing aids such as frequency shift, music pause, and overall clearer hearing.

Overall:
Hearing is a very personal experience. No two people lose their hearing in the same way. A specialist adds value in helping to tune a hearing aid and help you use it most effectively. They will also help you pick the right one for the features you want. While this comes at a price, I think that price is worth it when considering how long and how often hearing aids will get used. Sennheiser has done an admirable job of creating a hearing aid at a value price point. It’s just not the one for me."
118,BestBuy,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,"Good quality , but not clearly remarkable.","Firstly I am a Best Bujy Tech Insider and I did receive these Sennheiser All-Day Clear Slim hearing aids for the putpose of review.

I am a long time hearing aid user, so I
have experience with hearing aids of which all have deficiencies and these Sennheiser All-Day Clear Slims are no excreption.

I like the build quality. The heavy bendable wire is a good asset as it helps keep the hearing aid on your ear in the case of the ear insert comming out. I like the app, it installed easily and quides you in the setup of the hearing aids. the volume of each side can be individually controlled or they can be merged as one. There is an audio equalizer, but it has limited adjustments. It comes with three sizes  of ear inserts.

The battery life is all day if you only use them as hearing aids, If you use it for streaming audio from a phone, tablet or laptop, battery life will be rather limited. The charging case does not have a battery for charging so it will have to be plugged in for charging.It comes with a decent user manual and extra wax guards and the tool to replace them. 

What needs to be made clear is that although they are Blue Tooth, you can't connect them to your TV without buying a rather expensive adapter that then connects with the Sennheiser All-Day Slim hearing aids, and that is a real bummer if you were hoping  to be able to stream audio in private from your TV.

What I thought that stood out as a plus was that it didn't seem to exagerate wind noise, creaks and rattles in my older car as my other aids do. While watching TV they seem to not exagerate surrounding  sounds, such as ceiling fans.

They do a decent job streaming audio, but not great unless you hold your fingers over the ear inserts, then they sound like good ear phones. So unless you want to do that or put ear muffs over them, the sound will be a little hollow. It has separate settings for streaming and listening, which they call ""live Music"".

Reviewing hearing aids is not scientific, as they will react differently for each individual. Also you have to give your brain time to learn to process what it receives and turn it into what will eventually sound normal for you.

As hearing aids go and considering what they cost,it is a toss up as to whether I would reccomend them to a friend without reviewing other hearing aids. You can buy a service package that allows you to take they to a hearing aid center or store for adjustment or repair. You can find the cost of that on Sennheiser's website.

I am sorry that I can't be all Rah Rah, or No Way, about these hearing aids, because until I have used them for an extended period, I can not make a certain yay or nay vote on these."
118,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Pretty darn good...,"The Sennheiser - All-Day Clear Slim - OTC Self-Fitting Hearing Aids have been…well, they’ve been a blessing.  To be able to hear more in a social setting is wonderful.  I’m using the phrase, “I’m sorry, what?” much less.  I appreciate that.  My family appreciates that.

The All-Day Clear Slims, like any hearing device, will take some time to get used to.  Incoming sound/voices seem to have a bit of a ‘canned’ quality.  I figure that’s going to take time for my brain to work out — and for me to fine tune as time goes on.  One thing that has made this experience much easier to deal with is the setup and controlling capabilities of the All-Day Clear mobile app.  It was one of the least tedious, easy setups that I have experienced with OTC hearing aids.  Thank you, Sennheiser.

Over time, I can only imagine that I’ll be using the app less and less.  Right now, it’s great to have total command as I continue to become familiar with them.  I can fine tune balance, volume, and tone (with an EQ) in either a split fashion, or both left and right together.  My set has two sound settings — Automatic, which seems to adjust incoming sound based upon your surroundings (like in a constantly changing social setting), and what Sennheiser calls the Live Music setting.  This setting seems to take everything in just as it is.  I have found myself having the Automatic setting on during most of the day.  When I’m relaxing in the evening and watching the TV or a movie, I prefer the Live Music setting…fewer sounds/voices dropping out and then returning.  Everything seems to stay more constant.  This is all kind of hard to explain.  You need to experience it yourself.

There are a couple things I wish were different —  

I wish the charging case had an internal battery to charge the aids overnight.  As it is, the case does need to be plugged in via USB-C.

I wish the receiver buds were tan or semi-translucent instead of black.  Less noticeable.

I wish the connective wire from the main body to the ear bud was just a tad bit longer — but that’s just the ‘design’ of my earlobe.

Even with all this in mind, these are darn good hearing aids.  Try ‘em out.  You’ll want to check with Sennheiser, but I believe that they offer a 30-day trial period…and with these, you don’t have to buy any hearing aid batteries ever again!"

I'm also impressed with the battery life, which allows for extended use without having to worry about constantly recharging.

Sennheiser - All-Day Clear Slim - OTC Self-Fitting Hearing Aid

I was looking for three main features in an OTC hearing aid: rechargeable, Bluetooth connectivity, and quality of sound. I found them all in these hearing aids. Sennheiser is world famous for their audio products, so I was banking on them putting their name on these *only* if they met strict quality standards. I was not disappointed. 

They’re light weight and easy to handle. Since they have a behind-the-ear component, the portion that goes into your ear is small and comfortable. The part that goes behind your ear is nearly invisible and has simple controls for changing volume and taking phone calls. The connecting wire is soft, but bendable and makes it easy to fit the aids to your liking. They feel secure, but with their open air design, not like some aids that feel stuffed in your ears. Also, they come with three earpiece sizes to fit each ear nicely.

Connecting the aids to your phone is easy with the app, which is also very straightforward. Once paired, a simple hearing preference test locks in your settings until you want to change them. The Bluetooth connectivity lets you listen to music (with quite nice sound quality!) or make and take phone calls. It’s important to note that the 16 hour battery life pertains to using the aids for hearing assistance, but using Bluetooth will only give you a few hours of battery life.

Charging the aids is easy with the enclosed charging case. Red, yellow and green indicators keep you up to date on charging progress. Taking the aids out of the charger turns them on and connects them to your phone. The app lets you adjust the overall volume or set it separately for each ear. You can fine tune the equalization with bass, mid tone, and treble sliders. Audio signals let you know when the batteries are running low.

Finally, due to their construction, sound is enhanced without sounding “canned” or artificial. The mixture of sound traveling directly to your ears combined with the amplified sound comes across as very natural."
118,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,i like this hearing aid,"I have to say that I am really impressed with the Sennheiser All Day Clear Slim product. With my regular small hearing losses, it is often difficult for me to fully enjoy my favorite music or follow a conversation clearly. However, since I started using this headset, my life has really changed. Its thin and lightweight design makes it extremely comfortable to wear all day, without any discomfort. Additionally, the exceptional sound clarity I get from these headphones is simply amazing. The bass is powerful and deep, and the highs are clear and crisp. Even when I'm in a noisy environment, the headphones manage to filter out the noise and give me a great hearing experience. I am truly grateful to have discovered the Sennheiser All Day Clear Slim, as it has improved my quality of life significantly. I highly recommend it to anyone with hearing problems as it really does make a huge difference."
118,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,VERY WELL MADE!,"I have been looking at OTC hearing aids for a while, I am a retired police officer.  And for 20 years I was a firearms instructor, the majority of that time I only used the soft foam, moldable in ear hearing protection.  Now I’m paying the price, my hearing is not what it used to be.  

I first off want to mention how well these are packaged by Sennheiser, the outer box was a mess, it looked as if it had been crushed and I was worried about the product inside.  But once I opened it and removed the inner box I realized they were not, due to the fact that Sennheiser put forth a lot of effort in packaging these hearing aids.  JOB WELL DONE1

Before I received these I downloaded the All-Day Clear app and registered for a new account.  When they arrived I was surprised that they were 77% charged. The initial setup w/ the app and the hearing aids was very easy.  It took about 2-3 minutes and I had them connected to my phone by bluetooth.  I took the time to try on the included soft, gel tips to find just the right fit for me.  I settled on the medium in my left ear and the small in my right.  My problem is that no matter what I do, whether its w/ these Sennheiser All-Day Clear Slim fearing aids or just in-ear headphones, God made my right ear different from the left as far as the canal is concerned.  My point is I never have a problem w/ my left ear, but my right ear after about an hour or so, I begin to experience ear fatigue.  And it gets to the point that I have to remove it.

118,BestBuy,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,Can you hear me clearly and cleanly now?,"This hearing aid, available over the counter and without prescription, will improve the lifestyle of someone with mild to moderate hearing loss, but not as well as many speciality hearing aids available through an audiologist. Miniaturization in technology continues to improve and I was hoping that this could be a breakthrough product to help more people to engage in the world more comfortably. Unfortunately, it’s not quite there yet.

Set up:
Sennheiser requires installing their ‘All-Day Clear’ app to your phone for set up. This is used to create a sound profile. Unfortunately, the app crashed once (after 10 minutes ‘pending’), which made the set up take longer. On the second attempt, the aids were set up properly. Another annoyance was a warning to see a professional when I set the left gain higher than the right gain. I’d been to an audiologist in the past and know that my hearing is worse on the left side. I don’t need Sennheiser to remind me of that!

After using it for a couple of hours, I wanted to tweak some of the settings to make certain situations easier to deal with. Unfortunately, the app required me to set up the hearing aids again from scratch in order to ‘Update’ the settings. I had to write down what the settings were initially so I could have a reference point from which to work. It certainly would have been simpler to be able to tweak the settings directly instead of having to remember or write it down.

Appearance:
It was pointed out to me that the black backing to the ear buds was very visible in my ears, along with the wire heading to the ear bud from the outside portion. While hearing loss is not something to be embarrassed about, I’m not keen on how clearly this pair highlights itself to showcase that I’m wearing something. While I was out and about, I did hear someone say they through I was wearing ear buds, which was odd for someone my age.

Usage (TV / Computer / Phone):
After a couple of attempts, I was able to connect the hearing aids to my computer. At first, it did not appear in the list of bluetooth devices. After putting the hearing aids back in the case, then taking them out again, they conencted. Once connected, the sound quality was decent and clear from the PC. I also tried to connect the ‘TV mode’ on the hearing aid to my TV. I have an external bluetooth adapter for the TV, which is driven from the optical audio out. I’ve used this witth a personal surround speaker from Sony (great product) and which had been a godsend for allowing me to raise the volume for myself without disburbing those around me. I was hoping the adapter would connect to the hearing aids, but it did not. 

Connecting to phone audio was easier in some ways. I was able to get music playing through the hearing aids and they sounded as good as the computer with decent frequency range. Howver, when I got a call, I wasn’t able to get that to connect directly. I ended up using the speakerphone on my cell or my caller wasn’t able to hear me.

Usage (Conversation):
Sennhieser has done a decent job of rejecting ambient noise and focusing on a close conversation. It was certainly a big improvement over not using anything (and my shouting to others as I coudn’t hear myself). From talking to others about their experience, however, they’ve noted useful features on their hearing aids such as frequency shift, music pause, and overall clearer hearing.

Overall:
Hearing is a very personal experience. No two people lose their hearing in the same way. A specialist adds value in helping to tune a hearing aid and help you use it most effectively. They will also help you pick the right one for the features you want. While this comes at a price, I think that price is worth it when considering how long and how often hearing aids will get used. Sennheiser has done an admirable job of creating a hearing aid at a value price point. It’s just not the one for me."

I am a long time hearing aid user, so I
have experience with hearing aids of which all have deficiencies and these Sennheiser All-Day Clear Slims are no excreption.

I like the build quality. The heavy bendable wire is a good asset as it helps keep the hearing aid on your ear in the case of the ear insert comming out. I like the app, it installed easily and quides you in the setup of the hearing aids. the volume of each side can be individually controlled or they can be merged as one. There is an audio equalizer, but it has limited adjustments. It comes with three sizes  of ear inserts.

The battery life is all day if you only use them as hearing aids, If you use it for streaming audio from a phone, tablet or laptop, battery life will be rather limited. The charging case does not have a battery for charging so it will have to be plugged in for charging.It comes with a decent user manual and extra wax guards and the tool to replace them. 

What needs to be made clear is that although they are Blue Tooth, you can't connect them to your TV without buying a rather expensive adapter that then connects with the Sennheiser All-Day Slim hearing aids, and that is a real bummer if you were hoping  to be able to stream audio in private from your TV.

What I thought that stood out as a plus was that it didn't seem to exagerate wind noise, creaks and rattles in my older car as my other aids do. While watching TV they seem to not exagerate surrounding  sounds, such as ceiling fans.

They do a decent job streaming audio, but not great unless you hold your fingers over the ear inserts, then they sound like good ear phones. So unless you want to do that or put ear muffs over them, the sound will be a little hollow. It has separate settings for streaming and listening, which they call ""live Music"".

Reviewing hearing aids is not scientific, as they will react differently for each individual. Also you have to give your brain time to learn to process what it receives and turn it into what will eventually sound normal for you.

As hearing aids go and considering what they cost,it is a toss up as to whether I would reccomend them to a friend without reviewing other hearing aids. You can buy a service package that allows you to take they to a hearing aid center or store for adjustment or repair. You can find the cost of that on Sennheiser's website.

I am sorry that I can't be all Rah Rah, or No Way, about these hearing aids, because until I have used them for an extended period, I can not make a certain yay or nay vote on these."
118,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Pretty darn good...,"The Sennheiser - All-Day Clear Slim - OTC Self-Fitting Hearing Aids have been…well, they’ve been a blessing.  To be able to hear more in a social setting is wonderful.  I’m using the phrase, “I’m sorry, what?” much less.  I appreciate that.  My family appreciates that.

The All-Day Clear Slims, like any hearing device, will take some time to get used to.  Incoming sound/voices seem to have a bit of a ‘canned’ quality.  I figure that’s going to take time for my brain to work out — and for me to fine tune as time goes on.  One thing that has made this experience much easier to deal with is the setup and controlling capabilities of the All-Day Clear mobile app.  It was one of the least tedious, easy setups that I have experienced with OTC hearing aids.  Thank you, Sennheiser.

Over time, I can only imagine that I’ll be using the app less and less.  Right now, it’s great to have total command as I continue to become familiar with them.  I can fine tune balance, volume, and tone (with an EQ) in either a split fashion, or both left and right together.  My set has two sound settings — Automatic, which seems to adjust incoming sound based upon your surroundings (like in a constantly changing social setting), and what Sennheiser calls the Live Music setting.  This setting seems to take everything in just as it is.  I have found myself having the Automatic setting on during most of the day.  When I’m relaxing in the evening and watching the TV or a movie, I prefer the Live Music setting…fewer sounds/voices dropping out and then returning.  Everything seems to stay more constant.  This is all kind of hard to explain.  You need to experience it yourself.

There are a couple things I wish were different —  

I wish the charging case had an internal battery to charge the aids overnight.  As it is, the case does need to be plugged in via USB-C.

I wish the receiver buds were tan or semi-translucent instead of black.  Less noticeable.

I wish the connective wire from the main body to the ear bud was just a tad bit longer — but that’s just the ‘design’ of my earlobe.

Even with all this in mind, these are darn good hearing aids.  Try ‘em out.  You’ll want to check with Sennheiser, but I believe that they offer a 30-day trial period…and with these, you don’t have to buy any hearing aid batteries ever again!"

Sennheiser - All-Day Clear Slim - OTC Self-Fitting Hearing Aid

I was looking for three main features in an OTC hearing aid: rechargeable, Bluetooth connectivity, and quality of sound. I found them all in these hearing aids. Sennheiser is world famous for their audio products, so I was banking on them putting their name on these *only* if they met strict quality standards. I was not disappointed. 

They’re light weight and easy to handle. Since they have a behind-the-ear component, the portion that goes into your ear is small and comfortable. The part that goes behind your ear is nearly invisible and has simple controls for changing volume and taking phone calls. The connecting wire is soft, but bendable and makes it easy to fit the aids to your liking. They feel secure, but with their open air design, not like some aids that feel stuffed in your ears. Also, they come with three earpiece sizes to fit each ear nicely.

Connecting the aids to your phone is easy with the app, which is also very straightforward. Once paired, a simple hearing preference test locks in your settings until you want to change them. The Bluetooth connectivity lets you listen to music (with quite nice sound quality!) or make and take phone calls. It’s important to note that the 16 hour battery life pertains to using the aids for hearing assistance, but using Bluetooth will only give you a few hours of battery life.

Charging the aids is easy with the enclosed charging case. Red, yellow and green indicators keep you up to date on charging progress. Taking the aids out of the charger turns them on and connects them to your phone. The app lets you adjust the overall volume or set it separately for each ear. You can fine tune the equalization with bass, mid tone, and treble sliders. Audio signals let you know when the batteries are running low.

Finally, due to their construction, sound is enhanced without sounding “canned” or artificial. The mixture of sound traveling directly to your ears combined with the amplified sound comes across as very natural."
118,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,i like this hearing aid,"I have to say that I am really impressed with the Sennheiser All Day Clear Slim product. With my regular small hearing losses, it is often difficult for me to fully enjoy my favorite music or follow a conversation clearly. However, since I started using this headset, my life has really changed. Its thin and lightweight design makes it extremely comfortable to wear all day, without any discomfort. Additionally, the exceptional sound clarity I get from these headphones is simply amazing. The bass is powerful and deep, and the highs are clear and crisp. Even when I'm in a noisy environment, the headphones manage to filter out the noise and give me a great hearing experience. I am truly grateful to have discovered the Sennheiser All Day Clear Slim, as it has improved my quality of life significantly. I highly recommend it to anyone with hearing problems as it really does make a huge difference."
118,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,VERY WELL MADE!,"I have been looking at OTC hearing aids for a while, I am a retired police officer.  And for 20 years I was a firearms instructor, the majority of that time I only used the soft foam, moldable in ear hearing protection.  Now I’m paying the price, my hearing is not what it used to be.  

I first off want to mention how well these are packaged by Sennheiser, the outer box was a mess, it looked as if it had been crushed and I was worried about the product inside.  But once I opened it and removed the inner box I realized they were not, due to the fact that Sennheiser put forth a lot of effort in packaging these hearing aids.  JOB WELL DONE1

Before I received these I downloaded the All-Day Clear app and registered for a new account.  When they arrived I was surprised that they were 77% charged. The initial setup w/ the app and the hearing aids was very easy.  It took about 2-3 minutes and I had them connected to my phone by bluetooth.  I took the time to try on the included soft, gel tips to find just the right fit for me.  I settled on the medium in my left ear and the small in my right.  My problem is that no matter what I do, whether its w/ these Sennheiser All-Day Clear Slim fearing aids or just in-ear headphones, God made my right ear different from the left as far as the canal is concerned.  My point is I never have a problem w/ my left ear, but my right ear after about an hour or so, I begin to experience ear fatigue.  And it gets to the point that I have to remove it.  It was the same w/ these.  That is no fault of the company, it’s just me.

As far as the product, its is VERY well made!  These are lightweight, that was the first thing that I noticed when I removed them from the case.  My wife and I rode our golf cart after I had the tips on and the hearing aids wire adjusted.  I chose the wind noise reduction setting, but I still had a lot of wind noise in both ears, not a big deal but it was noticeable.  When we arrived at home my wife was doing laundry and I was reading/listening to the television.  And I had the volume set to what I “normally” have it set on and immediately I had to turn it down.  I realized then that I really need hearing aids.  I was amazed, because I could hear.  My wife came out of the laundry room and asked why I turned the volume down and I told her that it was a bit overwhelming.  And it was/is.  I was hearing “noises” I had been missing.  I was shocked to hear the water discharging from the washing machine, I had never heard that.  I heard my wife running water in the kitchen sin, again, I hadn’t heard that.  And then, the ear pain started and I removed them for the night and charged them.  I went to Church the next morning and I was pleasantly surprised how well I could hear, again, I heard sounds, noises, voices, etc., that I hadn’t been used to hearing.  And the adjustability on the app makes fine tuning these to fit your need and surroundings so simple.  JOB WELL DONE!

The fit, other than my right ear is great.  No one has noticed (if they have they haven’t mentioned it) that I have these in.  They are sleek and when Sennheiser says “Slim” they aren’t kidding.  I was pleased how well they stayed in and allowed me to hear again.  Take the time to mold the wire to fit around the front part of the ear and they are truly not very noticeable.  The soft case that Sennheiser includes in the package is a great benefit for me, I put it in my pocket and when the ear fatigue starts I will take them out, I’ve tried leaving the left hearing aid in, but its hard to explain but I just don’t like the results, its as if I’m turning my head to the right to compensate and it becomes overwhelming.  My hope is that the more I wear these and get more accustomed to that “overwhelming” feeling that my ear fatigue will go away.  Because these Sennheiser All-Day Clear Slim have opened my eyes to how much I had lost in my hearing.  

JOB WELL DONE!"
118,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Easy to adjust,"It is nice to have hearing assistance and also be able to answer the phone or listen to music without having to switch between devices. It is a bit more obvious that I have something in my ear than other hearing assistance devices I have used, but most people assume it is an ear bud. It is convenient to be able to adjust the different levels if I want more or less bass for example I can use my phone to dial in when seems right for me. Not having something in my ear canal makes it more comfortable, although more obvious to others. The set up took a little bit, but was doable. Overall it is nice to have a little bit of assistance when I want it without having to go get an ear exam. I can adjust the settings depending on my environment. It is nice because if I know there is someones voice that I want to hear I can work at adapting the settings to be ideal for that voice to help me pick it out from the surrounding noises. The background adaption is a nice feature that helps balance levels."
118,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Performance - superb; aesthetics - so so :-(,"Excellent: the performance.  Vastly improved my hearing watching TV, movies, in restaurants, social gatherings - both indoors and outdoors.  The app had short learning curve, easy to use, accomplished all I wanted, once it was installed,  installation was an exercise in futility.  I was unable to use my apple email addresses, iCloud in that a 2 step process required my receiving and entering a verification code.  I was unable to receive the code despite using 3 different Apple based emails.  I had to phone the help desk and their suggestion was to use a gmail address.  I did, it worked, all went silky smooth.  My issues are with the aesthetics.  The portion of the hearing aid that goes into the ear is a prounounced BLACK color.  It should be a lite color or clear color rather than the eye catching black.  The wire that loops over the ear is just thick enough to also stand out.  I have another brand of Hearing aids that use the same format.  The ear inserts are almost unnoticeable, and the wires are of a narrower diameter and barely visible.  The aids charge quickly in their case, hence these aids are more desirable than my other aids where I am constantly replacing batteries.  I also love taking cell phone calls with the aids being the receiver.  If the 2 changes were made by the OEM, these aids would be 5 star!"

118,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,So Far... So Good,"I've tried audiologist tuned AI style hearing aids for over $4000 and I've tried the $100 ""guaranteed"" cheapos and both were terrible. Enter the middle ground: Sennheiser All Day Cleaer Slim. I've used them for almost two months and as long as I keep them on ""Live Music"" mode, they're great. I can hear so much better. The other ""automatic"" mode or whatever it's called, filters out too much of the things I WANT to hear. If I want that, I'll go back to the $4000 AI model. So... it's liveable. What I LOVE is that calls, music, streaming video audio all come through clear and clean and at enough volume that I can actually enjoy telephone conversations again. I don't like the behind the ear thing. It feels like I'm going to lose them from time to time, but they work better than the in-the-ear units I tried before. So Far... So Good"
118,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"Comfortable to wear, definitely aids hearing","Downloaded the All-Day Clear app.  The intro, e.g. user agreement was so lengthy, it seemed like I was reading a manual!  Next, I had to create an account.  This included agreeing to them processing my data.  What data do they need for me to use hearing aids!  You have to provide a real email or phone number as they will send a verification code for you to complete the account creation process.  Next is the process of pairing via Bluetooth with your phone.  It took a couple of tries and then they paired.  Streaming a video or listening to music on the phone, the Sennheiser hearing aids work pretty well. This is true for phone conversations including conference calls I do from the phone.  Normally I have the volume all the way up, with the hearing aids I was able to hear well at about 50% volume.  At first I didn’t think the hearing aids were working without the phone.  I didn’t think they helped with the TV.  With a little time I found the TV was too loud and kept turning it down.  It’s now at about 40% of the volume it was when I wasn’t wearing the hearing aids.  They do the job.  I do get some feedback if I touch my ears.  Why am I touching ears?  To make sure they are still in my ears!  They are so comfortable I don’t even realize I am wearing them.  I touch my ears to check if they are there and then I get feedback so I know yes they are there!  At first, I got a beep here and there and I didn’t know why.  I got a notification on my phone that says that is normal.  I think the hearing aids are tuning themselves."

Sennheiser - All-Day Clear Slim - OTC Self-Fitting Hearing Aid

I was looking for three main features in an OTC hearing aid: rechargeable, Bluetooth connectivity, and quality of sound. I found them all in these hearing aids. Sennheiser is world famous for their audio products, so I was banking on them putting their name on these *only* if they met strict quality standards. I was not disappointed. 

They’re light weight and easy to handle. Since they have a behind-the-ear component, the portion that goes into your ear is small and comfortable. The part that goes behind your ear is nearly invisible and has simple controls for changing volume and taking phone calls. The connecting wire is soft, but bendable and makes it easy to fit the aids to your liking. They feel secure, but with their open air design, not like some aids that feel stuffed in your ears. Also, they come with three earpiece sizes to fit each ear nicely.

Connecting the aids to your phone is easy with the app, which is also very straightforward. Once paired, a simple hearing preference test locks in your settings until you want to change them. The Bluetooth connectivity lets you listen to music (with quite nice sound quality!) or make and take phone calls. It’s important to note that the 16 hour battery life pertains to using the aids for hearing assistance, but using Bluetooth will only give you a few hours of battery life.

Charging the aids is easy with the enclosed charging case. Red, yellow and green indicators keep you up to date on charging progress. Taking the aids out of the charger turns them on and connects them to your phone. The app lets you adjust the overall volume or set it separately for each ear. You can fine tune the equalization with bass, mid tone, and treble sliders. Audio signals let you know when the batteries are running low.

Finally, due to their construction, sound is enhanced without sounding “canned” or artificial. The mixture of sound traveling directly to your ears combined with the amplified sound comes across as very natural."
118,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,i like this hearing aid,"I have to say that I am really impressed with the Sennheiser All Day Clear Slim product. With my regular small hearing losses, it is often difficult for me to fully enjoy my favorite music or follow a conversation clearly. However, since I started using this headset, my life has really changed. Its thin and lightweight design makes it extremely comfortable to wear all day, without any discomfort. Additionally, the exceptional sound clarity I get from these headphones is simply amazing. The bass is powerful and deep, and the highs are clear and crisp. Even when I'm in a noisy environment, the headphones manage to filter out the noise and give me a great hearing experience. I am truly grateful to have discovered the Sennheiser All Day Clear Slim, as it has improved my quality of life significantly. I highly recommend it to anyone with hearing problems as it really does make a huge difference."
118,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,VERY WELL MADE!,"I have been looking at OTC hearing aids for a while, I am a retired police officer.  And for 20 years I was a firearms instructor, the majority of that time I only used the soft foam, moldable in ear hearing protection.  Now I’m paying the price, my hearing is not what it used to be.  

I first off want to mention how well these are packaged by Sennheiser, the outer box was a mess, it looked as if it had been crushed and I was worried about the product inside.  But once I opened it and removed the inner box I realized they were not, due to the fact that Sennheiser put forth a lot of effort in packaging these hearing aids.  JOB WELL DONE1

Before I received these I downloaded the All-Day Clear app and registered for a new account.  When they arrived I was surprised that they were 77% charged. The initial setup w/ the app and the hearing aids was very easy.  It took about 2-3 minutes and I had them connected to my phone by bluetooth.  I took the time to try on the included soft, gel tips to find just the right fit for me.  I settled on the medium in my left ear and the small in my right.  My problem is that no matter what I do, whether its w/ these Sennheiser All-Day Clear Slim fearing aids or just in-ear headphones, God made my right ear different from the left as far as the canal is concerned.  My point is I never have a problem w/ my left ear, but my right ear after about an hour or so, I begin to experience ear fatigue.  And it gets to the point that I have to remove it.  It was the same w/ these.  That is no fault of the company, it’s just me.

As far as the product, its is VERY well made!  These are lightweight, that was the first thing that I noticed when I removed them from the case.  My wife and I rode our golf cart after I had the tips on and the hearing aids wire adjusted.  I chose the wind noise reduction setting, but I still had a lot of wind noise in both ears, not a big deal but it was noticeable.  When we arrived at home my wife was doing laundry and I was reading/listening to the television.  And I had the volume set to what I “normally” have it set on and immediately I had to turn it down.  I realized then that I really need hearing aids.  I was amazed, because I could hear.  My wife came out of the laundry room and asked why I turned the volume down and I told her that it was a bit overwhelming.  And it was/is.  I was hearing “noises” I had been missing.  I was shocked to hear the water discharging from the washing machine, I had never heard that.  I heard my wife running water in the kitchen sin, again, I hadn’t heard that.  And then, the ear pain started and I removed them for the night and charged them.  I went to Church the next morning and I was pleasantly surprised how well I could hear, again, I heard sounds, noises, voices, etc., that I hadn’t been used to hearing.  And the adjustability on the app makes fine tuning these to fit your need and surroundings so simple.  JOB WELL DONE!

The fit, other than my right ear is great.  No one has noticed (if they have they haven’t mentioned it) that I have these in.  They are sleek and when Sennheiser says “Slim” they aren’t kidding.  I was pleased how well they stayed in and allowed me to hear again.  Take the time to mold the wire to fit around the front part of the ear and they are truly not very noticeable.  The soft case that Sennheiser includes in the package is a great benefit for me, I put it in my pocket and when the ear fatigue starts I will take them out, I’ve tried leaving the left hearing aid in, but its hard to explain but I just don’t like the results, its as if I’m turning my head to the right to compensate and it becomes overwhelming.  My hope is that the more I wear these and get more accustomed to that “overwhelming” feeling that my ear fatigue will go away.  Because these Sennheiser All-Day Clear Slim have opened my eyes to how much I had lost in my hearing.  

JOB WELL DONE!"
118,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Easy to adjust,"It is nice to have hearing assistance and also be able to answer the phone or listen to music without having to switch between devices. It is a bit more obvious that I have something in my ear than other hearing assistance devices I have used, but most people assume it is an ear bud. It is convenient to be able to adjust the different levels if I want more or less bass for example I can use my phone to dial in when seems right for me. Not having something in my ear canal makes it more comfortable, although more obvious to others. The set up took a little bit, but was doable. Overall it is nice to have a little bit of assistance when I want it without having to go get an ear exam. I can adjust the settings depending on my environment. It is nice because if I know there is someones voice that I want to hear I can work at adapting the settings to be ideal for that voice to help me pick it out from the surrounding noises. The background adaption is a nice feature that helps balance levels."

118,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,So Far... So Good,"I've tried audiologist tuned AI style hearing aids for over $4000 and I've tried the $100 ""guaranteed"" cheapos and both were terrible. Enter the middle ground: Sennheiser All Day Cleaer Slim. I've used them for almost two months and as long as I keep them on ""Live Music"" mode, they're great. I can hear so much better. The other ""automatic"" mode or whatever it's called, filters out too much of the things I WANT to hear. If I want that, I'll go back to the $4000 AI model. So... it's liveable. What I LOVE is that calls, music, streaming video audio all come through clear and clean and at enough volume that I can actually enjoy telephone conversations again. I don't like the behind the ear thing. It feels like I'm going to lose them from time to time, but they work better than the in-the-ear units I tried before. So Far... So Good"
118,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"Comfortable to wear, definitely aids hearing","Downloaded the All-Day Clear app.  The intro, e.g. user agreement was so lengthy, it seemed like I was reading a manual!  Next, I had to create an account.  This included agreeing to them processing my data.  What data do they need for me to use hearing aids!  You have to provide a real email or phone number as they will send a verification code for you to complete the account creation process.  Next is the process of pairing via Bluetooth with your phone.  It took a couple of tries and then they paired.  Streaming a video or listening to music on the phone, the Sennheiser hearing aids work pretty well. This is true for phone conversations including conference calls I do from the phone.  Normally I have the volume all the way up, with the hearing aids I was able to hear well at about 50% volume.  At first I didn’t think the hearing aids were working without the phone.  I didn’t think they helped with the TV.  With a little time I found the TV was too loud and kept turning it down.  It’s now at about 40% of the volume it was when I wasn’t wearing the hearing aids.  They do the job.  I do get some feedback if I touch my ears.  Why am I touching ears?  To make sure they are still in my ears!  They are so comfortable I don’t even realize I am wearing them.  I touch my ears to check if they are there and then I get feedback so I know yes they are there!  At first, I got a beep here and there and I didn’t know why.  I got a notification on my phone that says that is normal.  I think the hearing aids are tuning themselves."
118,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Excellent choice!,"The Sennheiser - All-Day Clear Slim - OTC Self-Fitting Hearing Aid is an excellent OTC choice if you have the need.

My 72 year old mom moved in with us a couple years ago and both the wife and I (as well as our late-teens kids) noticed a gradual increase in TV and nusic volume coming from the basement. That in combination with us noticing an increasing presence of her asking for clarification during conversations, we were able to convince her that she may want to consider looking into hearing aids. She finally agreed and we are ALL so glad she did!

Inside the box, you'll find the usual suspects... The hearing aids, charger, cable, multiple tips, cleaning kit and a nice bonus of a casNiether of them being overly technical, I was impressed with how (relatively) quickly they had the hearing aids going.

As for quality, Sennheiser is universally recognized towards the upper end in consumer grade devices. This Clear Slim has a quality feel, look and design. 

End of the day mom loves them! she admitted she did not realiuze quite how far her hearing loss became. The conversations have been more engaging and theTV/music from the basement has almost dissapeared.

I wouldreccomend them to a friend!"
118,BestBuy,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,Can you hear me clearly and cleanly now?,"This hearing aid, available over the counter and without prescription, will improve the lifestyle of someone with mild to moderate hearing loss, but not as well as many speciality hearing aids available through an audiologist. Miniaturization in technology continues to improve and I was hoping that this could be a breakthrough product to help more people to engage in the world more comfortably. Unfortunately, it’s not quite there yet.

Set up:
Sennheiser requires installing their ‘All-Day Clear’ app to your phone for set up. This is used to create a sound profile. Unfortunately, the app crashed once (after 10 minutes ‘pending’), which made the set up take longer. On the second attempt, the aids were set up properly. Another annoyance was a warning to see a professional when I set the left gain higher than the right gain. I’d been to an audiologist in the past and know that my hearing is worse on the left side. I don’t need Sennheiser to remind me of that!

After using it for a couple of hours, I wanted to tweak some of the settings to make certain situations easier to deal with. Unfortunately, the app required me to set up the hearing aids again from scratch in order to ‘Update’ the settings. I had to write down what the settings were initially so I could have a reference point from which to work. It certainly would have been simpler to be able to tweak the settings directly instead of having to remember or write it down.

Appearance:
It was pointed out to me that the black backing to the ear buds was very visible in my ears, along with the wire heading to the ear bud from the outside portion. While hearing loss is not something to be embarrassed about, I’m not keen on how clearly this pair highlights itself to showcase that I’m wearing something. While I was out and about, I did hear someone say they through I was wearing ear buds, which was odd for someone my age.

Usage (TV / Computer / Phone):
After a couple of attempts, I was able to connect the hearing aids to my computer. At first, it did not appear in the list of bluetooth devices. After putting the hearing aids back in the case, then taking them out again, they conencted. Once connected, the sound quality was decent and clear from the PC. I also tried to connect the ‘TV mode’ on the hearing aid to my TV. I have an external bluetooth adapter for the TV, which is driven from the optical audio out. I’ve used this witth a personal surround speaker from Sony (great product) and which had been a godsend for allowing me to raise the volume for myself without disburbing those around me. I was hoping the adapter would connect to the hearing aids, but it did not. 

Connecting to phone audio was easier in some ways. I was able to get music playing through the hearing aids and they sounded as good as the computer with decent frequency range. Howver, when I got a call, I wasn’t able to get that to connect directly. I ended up using the speakerphone on my cell or my caller wasn’t able to hear me.

Usage (Conversation):
Sennhieser has done a decent job of rejecting ambient noise and focusing on a close conversation. It was certainly a big improvement over not using anything (and my shouting to others as I coudn’t hear myself). From talking to others about their experience, however, they’ve noted useful features on their hearing aids such as frequency shift, music pause, and overall clearer hearing.

Overall:
Hearing is a very personal experience. No two people lose their hearing in the same way. A specialist adds value in helping to tune a hearing aid and help you use it most effectively. They will also help you pick the right one for the features you want. While this comes at a price, I think that price is worth it when considering how long and how often hearing aids will get used. Sennheiser has done an admirable job of creating a hearing aid at a value price point. It’s just not the one for me."
118,BestBuy,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,"Good quality , but not clearly remarkable.","Firstly I am a Best Bujy Tech Insider and I did receive these Sennheiser All-Day Clear Slim hearing aids for the putpose of review.

I am a long time hearing aid user, so I
have experience with hearing aids of which all have deficiencies and these Sennheiser All-Day Clear Slims are no excreption.

I like the build quality. The heavy bendable wire is a good asset as it helps keep the hearing aid on your ear in the case of the ear insert comming out. I like the app, it installed easily and quides you in the setup of the hearing aids. the volume of each side can be individually controlled or they can be merged as one. There is an audio equalizer, but it has limited adjustments. It comes with three sizes  of ear inserts.

The battery life is all day if you only use them as hearing aids, If you use it for streaming audio from a phone, tablet or laptop, battery life will be rather limited. The charging case does not have a battery for charging so it will have to be plugged in for charging.It comes with a decent user manual and extra wax guards and the tool to replace them. 

What needs to be made clear is that although they are Blue Tooth, you can't connect them to your TV without buying a rather expensive adapter that then connects with the Sennheiser All-Day Slim hearing aids, and that is a real bummer if you were hoping  to be able to stream audio in private from your TV.

What I thought that stood out as a plus was that it didn't seem to exagerate wind noise, creaks and rattles in my older car as my other aids do. While watching TV they seem to not exagerate surrounding  sounds, such as ceiling fans.

They do a decent job streaming audio, but not great unless you hold your fingers over the ear inserts, then they sound like good ear phones. So unless you want to do that or put ear muffs over them, the sound will be a little hollow. It has separate settings for streaming and listening, which they call ""live Music"".

Reviewing hearing aids is not scientific, as they will react differently for each individual. Also you have to give your brain time to learn to process what it receives and turn it into what will eventually sound normal for you.

As hearing aids go and considering what they cost,it is a toss up as to whether I would reccomend them to a friend without reviewing other hearing aids. You can buy a service package that allows you to take they to a hearing aid center or store for adjustment or repair. You can find the cost of that on Sennheiser's website.

I am sorry that I can't be all Rah Rah, or No Way, about these hearing aids, because until I have used them for an extended period, I can not make a certain yay or nay vote on these."
118,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Pretty darn good...,"The Sennheiser - All-Day Clear Slim - OTC Self-Fitting Hearing Aids have been…well, they’ve been a blessing.  To be able to hear more in a social setting is wonderful.  I’m using the phrase, “I’m sorry, what?” much less.  I appreciate that.  My family appreciates that.

The All-Day Clear Slims, like any hearing device, will take some time to get used to.  Incoming sound/voices seem to have a bit of a ‘canned’ quality.  I figure that’s going to take time for my brain to work out — and for me to fine tune as time goes on.  One thing that has made this experience much easier to deal with is the setup and controlling capabilities of the All-Day Clear mobile app.  It was one of the least tedious, easy setups that I have experienced with OTC hearing aids.  Thank you, Sennheiser.

Over time, I can only imagine that I’ll be using the app less and less.  Right now, it’s great to have total command as I continue to become familiar with them.  I can fine tune balance, volume, and tone (with an EQ) in either a split fashion, or both left and right together.  My set has two sound settings — Automatic, which seems to adjust incoming sound based upon your surroundings (like in a constantly changing social setting), and what Sennheiser calls the Live Music setting.  This setting seems to take everything in just as it is.  I have found myself having the Automatic setting on during most of the day.  When I’m relaxing in the evening and watching the TV or a movie, I prefer the Live Music setting…fewer sounds/voices dropping out and then returning.  Everything seems to stay more constant.  This is all kind of hard to explain.  You need to experience it yourself.

There are a couple things I wish were different —  

I wish the charging case had an internal battery to charge the aids overnight.  As it is, the case does need to be plugged in via USB-C.

I wish the receiver buds were tan or semi-translucent instead of black.  Less noticeable.

I wish the connective wire from the main body to the ear bud was just a tad bit longer — but that’s just the ‘design’ of my earlobe.

Even with all this in mind, these are darn good hearing aids.  Try ‘em out.  You’ll want to check with Sennheiser, but I believe that they offer a 30-day trial period…and with these, you don’t have to buy any hearing aid batteries ever again!"

118,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,So Far... So Good,"I've tried audiologist tuned AI style hearing aids for over $4000 and I've tried the $100 ""guaranteed"" cheapos and both were terrible. Enter the middle ground: Sennheiser All Day Cleaer Slim. I've used them for almost two months and as long as I keep them on ""Live Music"" mode, they're great. I can hear so much better. The other ""automatic"" mode or whatever it's called, filters out too much of the things I WANT to hear. If I want that, I'll go back to the $4000 AI model. So... it's liveable. What I LOVE is that calls, music, streaming video audio all come through clear and clean and at enough volume that I can actually enjoy telephone conversations again. I don't like the behind the ear thing. It feels like I'm going to lose them from time to time, but they work better than the in-the-ear units I tried before. So Far... So Good"
118,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"Comfortable to wear, definitely aids hearing","Downloaded the All-Day Clear app.  The intro, e.g. user agreement was so lengthy, it seemed like I was reading a manual!  Next, I had to create an account.  This included agreeing to them processing my data.  What data do they need for me to use hearing aids!  You have to provide a real email or phone number as they will send a verification code for you to complete the account creation process.  Next is the process of pairing via Bluetooth with your phone.  It took a couple of tries and then they paired.  Streaming a video or listening to music on the phone, the Sennheiser hearing aids work pretty well. This is true for phone conversations including conference calls I do from the phone.  Normally I have the volume all the way up, with the hearing aids I was able to hear well at about 50% volume.  At first I didn’t think the hearing aids were working without the phone.  I didn’t think they helped with the TV.  With a little time I found the TV was too loud and kept turning it down.  It’s now at about 40% of the volume it was when I wasn’t wearing the hearing aids.  They do the job.  I do get some feedback if I touch my ears.  Why am I touching ears?  To make sure they are still in my ears!  They are so comfortable I don’t even realize I am wearing them.  I touch my ears to check if they are there and then I get feedback so I know yes they are there!  At first, I got a beep here and there and I didn’t know why.  I got a notification on my phone that says that is normal.  I think the hearing aids are tuning themselves."
118,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Excellent choice!,"The Sennheiser - All-Day Clear Slim - OTC Self-Fitting Hearing Aid is an excellent OTC choice if you have the need.

My 72 year old mom moved in with us a couple years ago and both the wife and I (as well as our late-teens kids) noticed a gradual increase in TV and nusic volume coming from the basement. That in combination with us noticing an increasing presence of her asking for clarification during conversations, we were able to convince her that she may want to consider looking into hearing aids. She finally agreed and we are ALL so glad she did!

Inside the box, you'll find the usual suspects... The hearing aids, charger, cable, multiple tips, cleaning kit and a nice bonus of a casNiether of them being overly technical, I was impressed with how (relatively) quickly they had the hearing aids going.

As for quality, Sennheiser is universally recognized towards the upper end in consumer grade devices. This Clear Slim has a quality feel, look and design. 

End of the day mom loves them! she admitted she did not realiuze quite how far her hearing loss became. The conversations have been more engaging and theTV/music from the basement has almost dissapeared.

I wouldreccomend them to a friend!"
118,BestBuy,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,Can you hear me clearly and cleanly now?,"This hearing aid, available over the counter and without prescription, will improve the lifestyle of someone with mild to moderate hearing loss, but not as well as many speciality hearing aids available through an audiologist. Miniaturization in technology continues to improve and I was hoping that this could be a breakthrough product to help more people to engage in the world more comfortably. Unfortunately, it’s not quite there yet.

Set up:
Sennheiser requires installing their ‘All-Day Clear’ app to your phone for set up. This is used to create a sound profile. Unfortunately, the app crashed once (after 10 minutes ‘pending’), which made the set up take longer. On the second attempt, the aids were set up properly. Another annoyance was a warning to see a professional when I set the left gain higher than the right gain. I’d been to an audiologist in the past and know that my hearing is worse on the left side. I don’t need Sennheiser to remind me of that!

After using it for a couple of hours, I wanted to tweak some of the settings to make certain situations easier to deal with. Unfortunately, the app required me to set up the hearing aids again from scratch in order to ‘Update’ the settings. I had to write down what the settings were initially so I could have a reference point from which to work. It certainly would have been simpler to be able to tweak the settings directly instead of having to remember or write it down.

Appearance:
It was pointed out to me that the black backing to the ear buds was very visible in my ears, along with the wire heading to the ear bud from the outside portion. While hearing loss is not something to be embarrassed about, I’m not keen on how clearly this pair highlights itself to showcase that I’m wearing something. While I was out and about, I did hear someone say they through I was wearing ear buds, which was odd for someone my age.

Usage (TV / Computer / Phone):
After a couple of attempts, I was able to connect the hearing aids to my computer. At first, it did not appear in the list of bluetooth devices. After putting the hearing aids back in the case, then taking them out again, they conencted. Once connected, the sound quality was decent and clear from the PC. I also tried to connect the ‘TV mode’ on the hearing aid to my TV. I have an external bluetooth adapter for the TV, which is driven from the optical audio out. I’ve used this witth a personal surround speaker from Sony (great product) and which had been a godsend for allowing me to raise the volume for myself without disburbing those around me. I was hoping the adapter would connect to the hearing aids, but it did not. 

Connecting to phone audio was easier in some ways. I was able to get music playing through the hearing aids and they sounded as good as the computer with decent frequency range. Howver, when I got a call, I wasn’t able to get that to connect directly. I ended up using the speakerphone on my cell or my caller wasn’t able to hear me.

Usage (Conversation):
Sennhieser has done a decent job of rejecting ambient noise and focusing on a close conversation. It was certainly a big improvement over not using anything (and my shouting to others as I coudn’t hear myself). From talking to others about their experience, however, they’ve noted useful features on their hearing aids such as frequency shift, music pause, and overall clearer hearing.

Overall:
Hearing is a very personal experience. No two people lose their hearing in the same way. A specialist adds value in helping to tune a hearing aid and help you use it most effectively. They will also help you pick the right one for the features you want. While this comes at a price, I think that price is worth it when considering how long and how often hearing aids will get used. Sennheiser has done an admirable job of creating a hearing aid at a value price point. It’s just not the one for me."
118,BestBuy,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,"Good quality , but not clearly remarkable.","Firstly I am a Best Bujy Tech Insider and I did receive these Sennheiser All-Day Clear Slim hearing aids for the putpose of review.

I am a long time hearing aid user, so I
have experience with hearing aids of which all have deficiencies and these Sennheiser All-Day Clear Slims are no excreption.

I like the build quality. The heavy bendable wire is a good asset as it helps keep the hearing aid on your ear in the case of the ear insert comming out. I like the app, it installed easily and quides you in the setup of the hearing aids. the volume of each side can be individually controlled or they can be merged as one. There is an audio equalizer, but it has limited adjustments. It comes with three sizes  of ear inserts.

The battery life is all day if you only use them as hearing aids, If you use it for streaming audio from a phone, tablet or laptop, battery life will be rather limited. The charging case does not have a battery for charging so it will have to be plugged in for charging.It comes with a decent user manual and extra wax guards and the tool to replace them. 

What needs to be made clear is that although they are Blue Tooth, you can't connect them to your TV without buying a rather expensive adapter that then connects with the Sennheiser All-Day Slim hearing aids, and that is a real bummer if you were hoping  to be able to stream audio in private from your TV.

What I thought that stood out as a plus was that it didn't seem to exagerate wind noise, creaks and rattles in my older car as my other aids do. While watching TV they seem to not exagerate surrounding  sounds, such as ceiling fans.

They do a decent job streaming audio, but not great unless you hold your fingers over the ear inserts, then they sound like good ear phones. So unless you want to do that or put ear muffs over them, the sound will be a little hollow. It has separate settings for streaming and listening, which they call ""live Music"".

Reviewing hearing aids is not scientific, as they will react differently for each individual. Also you have to give your brain time to learn to process what it receives and turn it into what will eventually sound normal for you.

As hearing aids go and considering what they cost,it is a toss up as to whether I would reccomend them to a friend without reviewing other hearing aids. You can buy a service package that allows you to take they to a hearing aid center or store for adjustment or repair. You can find the cost of that on Sennheiser's website.

I am sorry that I can't be all Rah Rah, or No Way, about these hearing aids, because until I have used them for an extended period, I can not make a certain yay or nay vote on these."

118,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Great OTC hearing aids need some tweaks,"In the box:
•	Left & right hearing aids
•	Charging case
•	Small, medium, & large eartips (1 pair each)
•	Extra wax guards (x6)
•	Cleaning brush (inside charging case)
•	Carrying case
•	Power adapter (5v 1A)
•	Charging cable (USB-A to USB-C)
•	User’s Guide (and other printed materials)

Setup:
The setup instructions advise that the hearing aids be charged for at least 3 hours before first use.
After some initial challenges, the hearing aids were successfully paired with my iPhone. Of note, there are 3 devices that may show up in your phones Bluetooth settings. The main device (All-Day Clear Slim) is the one that controls the connection with the phone. The other two (L – All-Day Clear Slim, and R – All-Day Clear Slim) are low energy connections by which the Sennheiser app controls the settings in the hearing aids. These low energy devices may appear in the list of Bluetooth devices on your phone, but connections to them are controlled by the app (i.e., you do not need to manually connect them in your system’s Bluetooth settings).
The setup process is guided by the All-Day Clear App (available from the Apple App Store and Google Play Store). Early in the process, you will need to go to your system Bluetooth settings (without closing the Sennheiser App), connect to the All-Day Clear Slim device, and return to the App to complete the setup. The App will control pairing of the left and right earpieces. Once paired, you will be guided through setting up a sound profile. The profile customizes the volume and frequency settings.
When your profile is complete, you can close the App. The hearing aids will retain the settings in the profile even if the App is closed or the phone is out of range (or turned off).
By default, connectivity on the iPhone uses an adaptive Bluetooth protocol. You can disable adaptive Bluetooth in the App if you encounter connectivity issues. The hearing aids must be powered off then on for a change in settings to take effect.
I was also able to pair the All-Day Clear Slim with my android phone, but couldn’t connect with it and my iPhone at the same time.

Fit & comfort:
I wear reading glasses and frequently put them on and take them off and was initially concerned by the behind-the-ear design. The thin ear loop and slim unit design made this a non-issue. The in-ear pieces are very small and comfortable. So much so that after about an hour I forget that they are there. The same is true of the behind-the-ear pieces. I would not notice them if not for the audible differences in my perception of the world around me. They do get a bit tiresome at the 6-hour mark, but this is far longer than I have been able to wear other OTC hearing aids.

Performance:
While some extraneous noise is amplified, there appears to be a substantial amount of signal processing going on. I hear more detail in my environment. Nonetheless, it will take time for my brain to develop some new filters for the for the unwanted sounds (e.g., fans, the TV in the next room, etc.).
There are instances when the hearing aids would lower ambient sound in one or both ears. This happens predictably when an auditory notification is generated by a connected phone. The hearing aids switch the audio source from their own microphones to the phone. After the signal from the phone ends, there is a slight delay before the hearing aid microphones re-engage. The transient (<0.5 seconds) lowering of ambient sound in the absence of a phone notification is unexplained, but only seemed to affect background noise, not conversations.
Volume on the hearing aid can be controlled with an 11-step slider. You can adjust both together or split the control and adjust volume for the left and right separately.
There is an 11-step, 3-band equalizer in the “Fine Tune” menu. It’s a nice feature, but not well implemented. Once you select Fine Tune to get to the equalizer, you have no other option than to select “Done”. If you have made changes, there is no way to quit without saving. If you don’t like the changes, you have to remember the original settings and reset them before pressing “Done”. Equalization settings apply to both earpieces even when you choose to split the volume controls.
Battery life is quite good. Approximately 12h of use took the batteries to 40% equally in the left and right earpieces.
Phone calls through the hearing aids were a major disappointment. Incoming sound quality was clipped, particularly in a noisy environment. Unlike streaming audio, the microphones must remain active when on a call. This sets up a bi-directional communication channel with the phone at which the All-Day Clear Slim is not well suited. Once paired, the App can still communicate with the hearing aids without having the main Bluetooth device connected. I actually prefer using the hearing aids without the phone connection. I can still adjust them with the App and there is no competition between the microphones in the hearing aids and phone notifications. I simply use my phone as I have for years. In this scenario, the hearing aids help, rather than hinder, calls.
Hearing aids remain on and Bluetooth connected even when they are in the charging case. They must be turned off in order to disconnect. Placing the hearing aids in the charging case should turn them off regardless of whether the power cord is connected.
It would have been nice if the charging case included a battery so that a wired power source was not always necessary for charging the hearing aids.
There was one occasion when the left hearing aid would not come on and would not charge in the case. Holding the button down for 30 seconds reset the unit. I had to do the same on the right and go through the setup process again. 

Overall:
I have tried a number of in-ear OTC hearing aids and, with rare exception, find them unhelpful at best and annoying at worst. The Sennheiser All-Day Clear Slim has convinced me that it is possible to make an OTC hearing aid that actually improves my hearing. Streaming audio is OK, but no match for good quality Bluetooth earphones. These are good hearing aids, but do not function well as a headset for making calls. A firmware update to turn the hearing aids off when in the case would be a big improvement and keep them from draining unnecessarily when not in use."

118,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Very good quality hearing aids with streaming,"Sennheiser - All-Day Clear Slim - OTC Self-Fitting Hearing Aid for Mild to Moderate Hearing Loss – All-Day Wear & Bluetooth - Gray

I was pleasantly surprised by the Sennheiser hearing aids I received. They truly are slimline and work very well - I've not had experience with more expensive hear aids, so I can't really compare the slimlines with those costing more.

Setup was straightforward with the help of a literal, printed manual included. Of course, the manual covers all the other aspects of use and care of the Sennheiser slimlines as well. The aids have their own charging case that can be plugged into a USB-C port or into the included charger that plugs into a wall outlet. Thee aids come with 3 sizes of eartips as well as a number of wax guards (the little nipple the eartips affix to). You can buy additional eartips and/or wax guards if you need to replace any of these over time. The aids have a button on each one if you want to adjust the volume, mode of sound, answer or disconnect from a phone call etc. The app for your phone gives you battery charge levels in the case and for each aid along with controls to adjust sound, sound mode, set the equalizer, wind noise adjustment, set ambient sound from 100% to 0% etc. During setup you go through a hearing test that adjusts the aids to your level and type of hearing loss.

I've worn the Sennheiser all day to include streaming for several hours of music and videos. After doing that, the remaining charge hits in the 40% to 50% range. The manufacturer claims about 16.5 hours of battery using the hearing aids mixed with some audio streaming, phone calls etc. I would say that's accurate based on my use.

In wearing the aids all day, I found them to be quite comfortable. They didn't bother my ear where the eartips reside in the canal nor did I even notice the slimline body of each aid behind my ears. I wear glasses and made sure my glasses earpiece on each side was on the outside of each slimline aid. This kept them tucked in next to my skull with no moving around. The wire going from the eartip to the slimline aid is bendable and holds its shape where it bridges over the top of the ear at the skull, so it holds the slimline in place anyway.

The Sennheiser aids will also connect directly to your TV, but I haven't gotten into that use at this time. Apparently there is an optional item you can purchase to connect to your TV for this; however, the aids should connect by BT (Blue Tooth) anyway without the optional item, but again, I haven't gotten into that at this time since TV connecting can be a bit complicated depending on your sound setup on your TV. It's doable, but in some circumstances it can be a little complicated.

The aids have multipoint capability, which means they can connect to two different BT devices (computer, tablet, phone, watch,  TV etc), but only two. Some devices have the capability to connect to 3 devices, but they are less common. Of course, you connect to one device at a time - the multipoint comes in when switching devices. If you're listening to music from your phone and then decide to watch/listen to a video on another device, your aids should simply switch to the last started audio device without you doing anything.

The slimline aids I have are a silver/gray color, which is fine. However, the microphones (the part the eartips attach to) are black. They resemble the visible part of earbuds you may have and use now for streaming audio. In other words, the Sennheiser ear piece doesn't disappear into the ear canal, but sets in the ear canal opening like earbuds, so the black outer surface (microphones) are visible. It actually looks like you have earbuds in your ears as you see so many people using to listen to music or talking on the phones without having to hold their phone. So, there's the visibility aspect of them I wanted to mention.

The other item I noticed is that while streaming audio from my computer when watching a video, I would lose BT contact momentarily with the audio stream if my head was held in a certain position. Moving my head slightly would regain the connection immediately so I'm not talking about a dropped BT connection but rather a temporary interrupted connection. This affected both aids at the same instant when this occurred.  I did the very same action using some good earbuds I have, and I couldn't reproduce the interruption with the BT connection on the earbuds. While not a scientific analysis of the issue, it seemed to me that, perhaps, the BT receiver/antenna in the Sennheiser aids, has a slight problem with reception with the receivers in a certain position relative to the device doing the streaming. At least that's what seems to occur since it does it each time with my head held in the same location/angle at my desk. It's not a deal breaker, but it's there nonetheless, and I've only noticed this sitting at my desk with my computer streaming audio to the aids.

Overall, the aids offer real comfort, long battery life, convenient streaming ability of music and phone calls and excellent sound quality. I do recommend these."
118,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,I think you can stop yelling at me,"To be middle aged and dealing with mild hearing loss is frustrating. You don't want to admit you cant hear or see so well anymore. But then others need to raise their voices at you or repeat things more than once and you secretly feel like you are being berated. Having to go to the doctor to get tested and fitted to a prescription hearing aid seems more trouble than it's worth. But with OTC hearing aids being available we can try to push that doctor visit back while longer. 

I have used other OTC hearing aids that fit like bluetooth ear buds, but found I couldn't really wear them all day. I always knew they were there. The Sennheiser All Day Slims are what they say they are. Slim and I can stand wearing them most of the day. Sound is clear when watching TV or taking phone calls over bluetooth although music depth is shallow, but my ear bud hearing aids can cover my music needs. In person conversations are easier to focus on. Although using them around AC window units can be a little distracting. I find I have to adjust the volume to a point where I am not overwhelmed by the droning of white noise over voices. 

Setup was very simple there is virtually no calibrations that are needed. Setting up a sennheiser account was the longest part of setting up. The app is also simple to use albeit a bit basic. The charge easily lasts a day and then some if you aren't using them continously from when you wake up to when u go to sleep. As far as wearing them all day, they are super light, fit comfortably and create no hot spots as some ear buds tend to do. The user interface is very simple. One button and one LED on each unit. Included in the pacakging was the charging case which must be plugged in to an included usb c charger, a slim travel case, and a clenaing brush integrated into the charging case. Speaking of charging, no need for swapping out super tiny batteries or keeping extra on hand. 

While they are comfortable and relatively more affordable than Rx hearing aids it does not preclude them from their faults. Controls seem a little too basic both on the units and the app. More control for tweaking the settings would've been preferred to adjust for different environments. I would like to see an on/off switch rather than having to press and hold. Sometimes I fat finger the unit and cover the LED and can't see if the light goes red or green. I don't understand the charging case. It's much larger than it needs to be. There is no internal battery so it must be plugged in to charge. There are no lights on the outside indicating charge status; must have lid open to see the charge lights. The aids will only auto turn on if you plug the unit in then remove the aids from the case. You must turn off  each aid before charging or they will create feedback that will drive non hearing challenged people nuts.... Wife yelled at me about some high pitched whine she was hearing and I said she might need to get her hearing checked. Then found out I forgot to turn off the aids before charging... Opps. But why can't they be shut off when put back in the cradle and turned on when removed? Seems like it should be more of a dock. And without a built in battery could've been shaped less like an egg. I noticed that sometimes the app has trouble connecting to one of the aids. But eventually connects. Hopefully this will not become a prevalent issue and gets improved with software updates.

Issues aside they do not break the All Day Slims for me. They help me hear better than without. And the rest of my family doesn't have to yell at me to tell me something or turn down the volume on the TV. I'm glad to be able to use these as an alternative to a full blown doctor prescribed $$$$hearing aid. At least for a few more years."
118,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Great OTC hearing aids.,"These are my favorite OTC hearing aids so far.  But there are a couple things as to why I am giving it a 4 star.  I will say those first.  

First is the case, it is pretty big but does not have a built-in battery, so it does not charge these unless it is plugged in.  That leads to my other issue, if it gets unplugged, the hearing aids will turn on and then they will make a high-pitched sound.  If you have had hearing aids before, this sound is the one that gets made when you put your hand over hearing aids.  I know this issue is not entirely with the case but related to it.  Even if I turn off the hearing aids prior, once placed in the case and power is plugged in, once power is cut off, they turn on.  These are few things for me.  Case being big is not that big a deal for me, but I don't see why it's as big as it is for not having a rechargeable battery that could charge the hearing aids if out and about.  And not a fan that they turn on when you unplug the case.  I have to open up the case and manually turn of each hearing aid.  

That said, they do at least include a smaller carrying case if you do go out and about.  But this case does not have a rechargeable battery either.  Just a smaller hard/soft case.  I would have preferred a case that could charge the hearing aids without needing to plug it in, and also be portable.  

I do love this style hearing aids though.  And these fit great in my ears as well.  I like the over the ear style as I have a lump in my outer ear, so other styles that sit there tend to fall out.   

These overall just sounded great compared to others I have had, as well as just felt a lot better wearing them, especially over time.  I did not have to keep readjusting them as often as others, especially for the left ear one.  

Sound was great, other than bass, but that is fine with me, and I did not really expect too much anyways.  They were easy to set up, although I wished the app did more of a hearing test style and set up based on that and then make adjustments.  I have more loss in one ear compared to the other, so it gave me the warning about that.  

The software was easy to use but a little confusing as well.  I was not sure if having the volume linked would set these to the same volume or keep my left ear higher and then allow to have volume up and down and equally adjust them.  

I love that I can get away with these at work and still listen to music lol.  (JK I don't do that).  But these can play your music thru them as well as hear what is going on.  But the music can get a bit louder so hard to hear things going on unless you mute the music.  

Overall, I enjoy these and for what being OTC, they work pretty well.  So far, the only pair I have that I feel is better are ones that I got a while ago that were custom made for each ear.  But those did not allow music to play thru them nor did they connect to my phone to adjust.  And used batteries.  

Lastly, I love that these are rechargeable, and they last all day.  Others I have used seem to last 4 or so hours.  

If you have not used hearing aids, they can take time to get used too.  Sounds are a bit different, as well as the fact that you will hear sounds you did not hear before.  

Overall great and I recommend these."
118,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,"One of the best OTC hearing aids, but...","I have several Sennheiser headphones and earbuds and I’ve always loved the quality, comfort and richness of sound so I was intrigued how Sennheiser would approach the new over the counter hearing aid market since Sonova acquired them.  Sonova is a leading provider of hearing care products and with the All-Day OTC hearing aids you can definitely see and hear the influence. 

These are the most comfortable hearing aids I’ve worn, including the pricey prescribed set I have owned for a couple of years.  They fit more like earbuds with full sized tips that fit snuggly in the ear canal and they don’t tickle my ears like my prescription set.  It comes with medium sized tips installed but included are smaller and larger tips so you can fit to your ear.

Setup was a breeze.  Install your flavor of the All-Day Clear app from Google Play or Apple Store and start the pairing process.  Once paired you set up your profile.  They use a canned conversation to listen to and you adjust volume, tone and clarity as needed for your hearing situation.  I have more hearing loss in my left ear and the app allows you to fine tune by splitting the volume controls for each ear.  Even more importantly, something missing from most over the counter hearing aids, is the ability to listen to music and have audio for phone calls.  That is a huge plus over other units.

As with all hearing aids the noise coming in from the built in mics is a bit tinny but you get used to it very quickly.  Sound coming in via Bluetooth is crystal clear and full bodied, meaning that it’s not much different than listening via earbuds.  I expected no less from Sennheiser.  

Using the phone app you can make adjustments on the fly.  In my office environment we have high levels of conversation at times so it’s great that the app allows you to dial in the volume you need so you can reduce the amount of ambient noise.   I usually have to dial it down a lot at times to reduce the distractions nearby.

The things I wish were different…
It would have been a good feature to have and option for a longer stem.  I wear glasses and with the size of my ear the body rides a bit higher and contacts the stems of my glasses.  I bit of extra length would allow the body to ride a bit lower behind the ear and not come in contact with the stems of my glasses.

I know the push is that these hearing aids have a 16 hour  battery life but they miss the boat that the charging case does not have a battery.  Case must be plugged in for it to charge the earpieces so you can’t charge the hearing aids if you are on the go.  At the price point and the sheer size of the charging case they should have included a reserve battery for charging on the go.  I would have opted for that rather than the padded carrying case, nice touch but unnecessary.  Give me a battery in the charging case please!!!"
118,BestBuy,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Couldnt get the app to work,Possibly the worst customer service on Sennheiser side I’ve experienced. I dont usually leave reveiws but i couldnt even connect to the app. Sennheiser also tried helping and they didnt even know what the issue was. Im guessing if i was able to connect it would have been good but i have never been as frustrated with a piece to tech as i was with this. I just want to hear lol
118,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,High quality OTC hearing aids,"This is my second style of OTC hearing aids I have tried and I have quickly noticed some positive differences. The other set I have is more of a ""ear bud"" style which I did originally like because they looked like regular wireless ear buds and they were pretty small. However, battery life wasn't ideal for all day usage with those more of just a pop them in when there is a reason to hear better kind of set-up. Originally I was hesitant for this style thinking that they would be a little unsightly for my age bracket (sub 40 years old). While I probably wont be gaining any style points at the club these are barely noticeable and substantially more comfortable to use over the entire day. Having the wire go from the ear piece to the body behind the lobe provides good weight distribution and better comfort. I had no issues using the medium size ear insert that comes pre-installed but they do also include a small and large set for other ear shapes. These offer much better battery life than the ear bud style, I would imagine also being contributed to the design to allow more space for a larger battery. The charging case is pretty large and bulky, but it does use USB-C thankfully, they do also include a smaller leather carrying case. Neither the charging case or the carrying case offer any on-the-go charging functionality. That has not been a necessity for me yet, I am able to get 12+ hours of use in on a single charge. Sound quality has been good, not very harsh in the way it amplifies and makes it easy to focus on voices and not flood you with background noise. Overall I have been very happy with these as finding something that fits well is extremely important for how good they will function. Sennheiser is a brand I have been familiar with and trust for quality, so far these hearing aids haven't disappointed yet."
118,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Pretty darn good...,"The Sennheiser - All-Day Clear Slim - OTC Self-Fitting Hearing Aids have been…well, they’ve been a blessing.  To be able to hear more in a social setting is wonderful.  I’m using the phrase, “I’m sorry, what?” much less.  I appreciate that.  My family appreciates that.

The All-Day Clear Slims, like any hearing device, will take some time to get used to.  Incoming sound/voices seem to have a bit of a ‘canned’ quality.  I figure that’s going to take time for my brain to work out — and for me to fine tune as time goes on.  One thing that has made this experience much easier to deal with is the setup and controlling capabilities of the All-Day Clear mobile app.  It was one of the least tedious, easy setups that I have experienced with OTC hearing aids.  Thank you, Sennheiser.

Over time, I can only imagine that I’ll be using the app less and less.  Right now, it’s great to have total command as I continue to become familiar with them.  I can fine tune balance, volume, and tone (with an EQ) in either a split fashion, or both left and right together.  My set has two sound settings — Automatic, which seems to adjust incoming sound based upon your surroundings (like in a constantly changing social setting), and what Sennheiser calls the Live Music setting.  This setting seems to take everything in just as it is.  I have found myself having the Automatic setting on during most of the day.  When I’m relaxing in the evening and watching the TV or a movie, I prefer the Live Music setting…fewer sounds/voices dropping out and then returning.  Everything seems to stay more constant.  This is all kind of hard to explain.  You need to experience it yourself.

There are a couple things I wish were different —  

I wish the charging case had an internal battery to charge the aids overnight.  As it is, the case does need to be plugged in via USB-C.

I wish the receiver buds were tan or semi-translucent instead of black.  Less noticeable.

I wish the connective wire from the main body to the ear bud was just a tad bit longer — but that’s just the ‘design’ of my earlobe.

Even with all this in mind, these are darn good hearing aids.  Try ‘em out.  You’ll want to check with Sennheiser, but I believe that they offer a 30-day trial period…and with these, you don’t have to buy any hearing aid batteries ever again!"
118,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,I like this product,"I recently had the opportunity to try the Sennheiser All Day Clear Slim product and I am happy to share my positive review about it. First of all, I must highlight the exceptional sound quality it offers. The bass is deep and powerful, while the treble is clear and precise, providing a most enjoyable listening experience. Plus, its slim, sleek design makes it very comfortable to wear throughout the day, without putting undue pressure on my ears. I'm also impressed with the battery life, which allows for extended use without having to worry about constantly recharging. Finally, I appreciate the noise reduction feature, which allows me to fully enjoy my music by filtering out external distractions. In short, the Sennheiser All Day Clear Slim product is a perfect choice for all women wishing to combine style, comfort and exceptional sound quality."

Sennheiser - All-Day Clear Slim - OTC Self-Fitting Hearing Aid

I was looking for three main features in an OTC hearing aid: rechargeable, Bluetooth connectivity, and quality of sound. I found them all in these hearing aids. Sennheiser is world famous for their audio products, so I was banking on them putting their name on these *only* if they met strict quality standards. I was not disappointed. 

They’re light weight and easy to handle. Since they have a behind-the-ear component, the portion that goes into your ear is small and comfortable. The part that goes behind your ear is nearly invisible and has simple controls for changing volume and taking phone calls. The connecting wire is soft, but bendable and makes it easy to fit the aids to your liking. They feel secure, but with their open air design, not like some aids that feel stuffed in your ears. Also, they come with three earpiece sizes to fit each ear nicely.

Connecting the aids to your phone is easy with the app, which is also very straightforward. Once paired, a simple hearing preference test locks in your settings until you want to change them. The Bluetooth connectivity lets you listen to music (with quite nice sound quality!) or make and take phone calls. It’s important to note that the 16 hour battery life pertains to using the aids for hearing assistance, but using Bluetooth will only give you a few hours of battery life.

Charging the aids is easy with the enclosed charging case. Red, yellow and green indicators keep you up to date on charging progress. Taking the aids out of the charger turns them on and connects them to your phone. The app lets you adjust the overall volume or set it separately for each ear. You can fine tune the equalization with bass, mid tone, and treble sliders. Audio signals let you know when the batteries are running low.

Finally, due to their construction, sound is enhanced without sounding “canned” or artificial. The mixture of sound traveling directly to your ears combined with the amplified sound comes across as very natural."
118,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,i like this hearing aid,"I have to say that I am really impressed with the Sennheiser All Day Clear Slim product. With my regular small hearing losses, it is often difficult for me to fully enjoy my favorite music or follow a conversation clearly. However, since I started using this headset, my life has really changed. Its thin and lightweight design makes it extremely comfortable to wear all day, without any discomfort. Additionally, the exceptional sound clarity I get from these headphones is simply amazing. The bass is powerful and deep, and the highs are clear and crisp. Even when I'm in a noisy environment, the headphones manage to filter out the noise and give me a great hearing experience. I am truly grateful to have discovered the Sennheiser All Day Clear Slim, as it has improved my quality of life significantly. I highly recommend it to anyone with hearing problems as it really does make a huge difference."
118,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,VERY WELL MADE!,"I have been looking at OTC hearing aids for a while, I am a retired police officer.  And for 20 years I was a firearms instructor, the majority of that time I only used the soft foam, moldable in ear hearing protection.  Now I’m paying the price, my hearing is not what it used to be.  

I first off want to mention how well these are packaged by Sennheiser, the outer box was a mess, it looked as if it had been crushed and I was worried about the product inside.  But once I opened it and removed the inner box I realized they were not, due to the fact that Sennheiser put forth a lot of effort in packaging these hearing aids.  JOB WELL DONE1

Before I received these I downloaded the All-Day Clear app and registered for a new account.  When they arrived I was surprised that they were 77% charged. The initial setup w/ the app and the hearing aids was very easy.  It took about 2-3 minutes and I had them connected to my phone by bluetooth.  I took the time to try on the included soft, gel tips to find just the right fit for me.  I settled on the medium in my left ear and the small in my right.  My problem is that no matter what I do, whether its w/ these Sennheiser All-Day Clear Slim fearing aids or just in-ear headphones, God made my right ear different from the left as far as the canal is concerned.  My point is I never have a problem w/ my left ear, but my right ear after about an hour or so, I begin to experience ear fatigue.  And it gets to the point that I have to remove it.  It was the same w/ these.  That is no fault of the company, it’s just me.

As far as the product, its is VERY well made!  These are lightweight, that was the first thing that I noticed when I removed them from the case.  My wife and I rode our golf cart after I had the tips on and the hearing aids wire adjusted.  I chose the wind noise reduction setting, but I still had a lot of wind noise in both ears, not a big deal but it was noticeable.  When we arrived at home my wife was doing laundry and I was reading/listening to the television.  And I had the volume set to what I “normally” have it set on and immediately I had to turn it down.  I realized then that I really need hearing aids.  I was amazed, because I could hear.  My wife came out of the laundry room and asked why I turned the volume down and I told her that it was a bit overwhelming.  And it was/is.  I was hearing “noises” I had been missing.  I was shocked to hear the water discharging from the washing machine, I had never heard that.  I heard my wife running water in the kitchen sin, again, I hadn’t heard that.  And then, the ear pain started and I removed them for the night and charged them.  I went to Church the next morning and I was pleasantly surprised how well I could hear, again, I heard sounds, noises, voices, etc., that I hadn’t been used to hearing.  And the adjustability on the app makes fine tuning these to fit your need and surroundings so simple.  JOB WELL DONE!

The fit, other than my right ear is great.  No one has noticed (if they have they haven’t mentioned it) that I have these in.  They are sleek and when Sennheiser says “Slim” they aren’t kidding.  I was pleased how well they stayed in and allowed me to hear again.  Take the time to mold the wire to fit around the front part of the ear and they are truly not very noticeable.  The soft case that Sennheiser includes in the package is a great benefit for me, I put it in my pocket and when the ear fatigue starts I will take them out, I’ve tried leaving the left hearing aid in, but its hard to explain but I just don’t like the results, its as if I’m turning my head to the right to compensate and it becomes overwhelming.  My hope is that the more I wear these and get more accustomed to that “overwhelming” feeling that my ear fatigue will go away.  Because these Sennheiser All-Day Clear Slim have opened my eyes to how much I had lost in my hearing.  

JOB WELL DONE!"
118,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Easy to adjust,"It is nice to have hearing assistance and also be able to answer the phone or listen to music without having to switch between devices. It is a bit more obvious that I have something in my ear than other hearing assistance devices I have used, but most people assume it is an ear bud. It is convenient to be able to adjust the different levels if I want more or less bass for example I can use my phone to dial in when seems right for me. Not having something in my ear canal makes it more comfortable, although more obvious to others. The set up took a little bit, but was doable. Overall it is nice to have a little bit of assistance when I want it without having to go get an ear exam. I can adjust the settings depending on my environment. It is nice because if I know there is someones voice that I want to hear I can work at adapting the settings to be ideal for that voice to help me pick it out from the surrounding noises. The background adaption is a nice feature that helps balance levels."
118,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Performance - superb; aesthetics - so so :-(,"Excellent: the performance.  Vastly improved my hearing watching TV, movies, in restaurants, social gatherings - both indoors and outdoors.  The app had short learning curve, easy to use, accomplished all I wanted, once it was installed,  installation was an exercise in futility.  I was unable to use my apple email addresses, iCloud in that a 2 step process required my receiving and entering a verification code.  I was unable to receive the code despite using 3 different Apple based emails.  I had to phone the help desk and their suggestion was to use a gmail address.  I did, it worked, all went silky smooth.  My issues are with the aesthetics.  The portion of the hearing aid that goes into the ear is a prounounced BLACK color.  It should be a lite color or clear color rather than the eye catching black.  The wire that loops over the ear is just thick enough to also stand out.  I have another brand of Hearing aids that use the same format.  The ear inserts are almost unnoticeable, and the wires are of a narrower diameter and barely visible.  The aids charge quickly in their case, hence these aids are more desirable than my other aids where I am constantly replacing batteries.  I also love taking cell phone calls with the aids being the receiver.  If the 2 changes were made by the OEM, these aids would be 5 star!"

118,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,So Far... So Good,"I've tried audiologist tuned AI style hearing aids for over $4000 and I've tried the $100 ""guaranteed"" cheapos and both were terrible. Enter the middle ground: Sennheiser All Day Cleaer Slim. I've used them for almost two months and as long as I keep them on ""Live Music"" mode, they're great. I can hear so much better. The other ""automatic"" mode or whatever it's called, filters out too much of the things I WANT to hear. If I want that, I'll go back to the $4000 AI model. So... it's liveable. What I LOVE is that calls, music, streaming video audio all come through clear and clean and at enough volume that I can actually enjoy telephone conversations again. I don't like the behind the ear thing. It feels like I'm going to lose them from time to time, but they work better than the in-the-ear units I tried before. So Far... So Good"
118,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"Comfortable to wear, definitely aids hearing","Downloaded the All-Day Clear app.  The intro, e.g. user agreement was so lengthy, it seemed like I was reading a manual!  Next, I had to create an account.  This included agreeing to them processing my data.  What data do they need for me to use hearing aids!  You have to provide a real email or phone number as they will send a verification code for you to complete the account creation process.  Next is the process of pairing via Bluetooth with your phone.  It took a couple of tries and then they paired.  Streaming a video or listening to music on the phone, the Sennheiser hearing aids work pretty well. This is true for phone conversations including conference calls I do from the phone.  Normally I have the volume all the way up, with the hearing aids I was able to hear well at about 50% volume.  At first I didn’t think the hearing aids were working without the phone.  I didn’t think they helped with the TV.  With a little time I found the TV was too loud and kept turning it down.  It’s now at about 40% of the volume it was when I wasn’t wearing the hearing aids.  They do the job.  I do get some feedback if I touch my ears.  Why am I touching ears?  To make sure they are still in my ears!  They are so comfortable I don’t even realize I am wearing them.  I touch my ears to check if they are there and then I get feedback so I know yes they are there!  At first, I got a beep here and there and I didn’t know why.  I got a notification on my phone that says that is normal.  I think the hearing aids are tuning themselves."
118,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Excellent choice!,"The Sennheiser - All-Day Clear Slim - OTC Self-Fitting Hearing Aid is an excellent OTC choice if you have the need.

My 72 year old mom moved in with us a couple years ago and both the wife and I (as well as our late-teens kids) noticed a gradual increase in TV and nusic volume coming from the basement. That in combination with us noticing an increasing presence of her asking for clarification during conversations, we were able to convince her that she may want to consider looking into hearing aids. She finally agreed and we are ALL so glad she did!

Inside the box, you'll find the usual suspects... The hearing aids, charger, cable, multiple tips, cleaning kit and a nice bonus of a casNiether of them being overly technical, I was impressed with how (relatively) quickly they had the hearing aids going.

As for quality, Sennheiser is universally recognized towards the upper end in consumer grade devices. This Clear Slim has a quality feel, look and design. 

End of the day mom loves them! she admitted she did not realiuze quite how far her hearing loss became. The conversations have been more engaging and theTV/music from the basement has almost dissapeared.

I wouldreccomend them to a friend!"
118,BestBuy,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,Can you hear me clearly and cleanly now?,"This hearing aid, available over the counter and without prescription, will improve the lifestyle of someone with mild to moderate hearing loss, but not as well as many speciality hearing aids available through an audiologist. Miniaturization in technology continues to improve and I was hoping that this could be a breakthrough product to help more people to engage in the world more comfortably. Unfortunately, it’s not quite there yet.

Set up:
Sennheiser requires installing their ‘All-Day Clear’ app to your phone for set up. This is used to create a sound profile. Unfortunately, the app crashed once (after 10 minutes ‘pending’), which made the set up take longer. On the second attempt, the aids were set up properly. Another annoyance was a warning to see a professional when I set the left gain higher than the right gain. I’d been to an audiologist in the past and know that my hearing is worse on the left side. I don’t need Sennheiser to remind me of that!

After using it for a couple of hours, I wanted to tweak some of the settings to make certain situations easier to deal with. Unfortunately, the app required me to set up the hearing aids again from scratch in order to ‘Update’ the settings. I had to write down what the settings were initially so I could have a reference point from which to work. It certainly would have been simpler to be able to tweak the settings directly instead of having to remember or write it down.

Appearance:
It was pointed out to me that the black backing to the ear buds was very visible in my ears, along with the wire heading to the ear bud from the outside portion. While hearing loss is not something to be embarrassed about, I’m not keen on how clearly this pair highlights itself to showcase that I’m wearing something. While I was out and about, I did hear someone say they through I was wearing ear buds, which was odd for someone my age.

Usage (TV / Computer / Phone):
After a couple of attempts, I was able to connect the hearing aids to my computer. At first, it did not appear in the list of bluetooth devices. After putting the hearing aids back in the case, then taking them out again, they conencted. Once connected, the sound quality was decent and clear from the PC. I also tried to connect the ‘TV mode’ on the hearing aid to my TV. I have an external bluetooth adapter for the TV, which is driven from the optical audio out. I’ve used this witth a personal surround speaker from Sony (great product) and which had been a godsend for allowing me to raise the volume for myself without disburbing those around me. I was hoping the adapter would connect to the hearing aids, but it did not. 

Connecting to phone audio was easier in some ways. I was able to get music playing through the hearing aids and they sounded as good as the computer with decent frequency range. Howver, when I got a call, I wasn’t able to get that to connect directly. I ended up using the speakerphone on my cell or my caller wasn’t able to hear me.

Usage (Conversation):
Sennhieser has done a decent job of rejecting ambient noise and focusing on a close conversation. It was certainly a big improvement over not using anything (and my shouting to others as I coudn’t hear myself). From talking to others about their experience, however, they’ve noted useful features on their hearing aids such as frequency shift, music pause, and overall clearer hearing.

Overall:
Hearing is a very personal experience. No two people lose their hearing in the same way. A specialist adds value in helping to tune a hearing aid and help you use it most effectively. They will also help you pick the right one for the features you want. While this comes at a price, I think that price is worth it when considering how long and how often hearing aids will get used. Sennheiser has done an admirable job of creating a hearing aid at a value price point. It’s just not the one for me."
118,BestBuy,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,"Good quality , but not clearly remarkable.","Firstly I am a Best Bujy Tech Insider and I did receive these Sennheiser All-Day Clear Slim hearing aids for the putpose of review.

I am a long time hearing aid user, so I
have experience with hearing aids of which all have deficiencies and these Sennheiser All-Day Clear Slims are no excreption.

I like the build quality. The heavy bendable wire is a good asset as it helps keep the hearing aid on your ear in the case of the ear insert comming out. I like the app, it installed easily and quides you in the setup of the hearing aids. the volume of each side can be individually controlled or they can be merged as one. There is an audio equalizer, but it has limited adjustments. It comes with three sizes  of ear inserts.

The battery life is all day if you only use them as hearing aids, If you use it for streaming audio from a phone, tablet or laptop, battery life will be rather limited. The charging case does not have a battery for charging so it will have to be plugged in for charging.It comes with a decent user manual and extra wax guards and the tool to replace them. 

What needs to be made clear is that although they are Blue Tooth, you can't connect them to your TV without buying a rather expensive adapter that then connects with the Sennheiser All-Day Slim hearing aids, and that is a real bummer if you were hoping  to be able to stream audio in private from your TV.

What I thought that stood out as a plus was that it didn't seem to exagerate wind noise, creaks and rattles in my older car as my other aids do. While watching TV they seem to not exagerate surrounding  sounds, such as ceiling fans.

They do a decent job streaming audio, but not great unless you hold your fingers over the ear inserts, then they sound like good ear phones. So unless you want to do that or put ear muffs over them, the sound will be a little hollow. It has separate settings for streaming and listening, which they call ""live Music"".

Reviewing hearing aids is not scientific, as they will react differently for each individual. Also you have to give your brain time to learn to process what it receives and turn it into what will eventually sound normal for you.

As hearing aids go and considering what they cost,it is a toss up as to whether I would reccomend them to a friend without reviewing other hearing aids. You can buy a service package that allows you to take they to a hearing aid center or store for adjustment or repair. You can find the cost of that on Sennheiser's website.

I am sorry that I can't be all Rah Rah, or No Way, about these hearing aids, because until I have used them for an extended period, I can not make a certain yay or nay vote on these."
118,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,"Great Mic Location, Uncomfortable for Long Use","--- SETUP ---
The hearing aids were a quick setup.  Remove from packaging, charge with the included USB C cable, and begin using after a full charge.  

--- FEATURES ---
Customize your own profile, can adapt to environment changes, listen to music from your mobile device, long battery life, rechargeable batteries.

--- PERFORMANCE AND EXPECTATIONS ---
Pros:
One thing that makes these hearing aids stand out from others is the location of the microphone.  The microphone is located at the hearing bud vs. behind the ear.  As a male with long hair, this is preferred, as there is one less barrier preventing sound reaching my ears.  

Having a long lasting battery life, these hearing aids last you way past regular office hours.  I leave my hearing aids at work, as that’s where I interact with most people.  Sometimes, I’d bring the buds home and forget the charging case.  When I returned the next day, they still had enough battery to help me get through half a day.  At which point, I’d let them charge for an hour or two and then resume use.

A cleaning brush and different sized ear gels are provided to best fit your needs.

Cons:
Normally, the installed ear gels work for me.  In this case, I had to change to the smaller ear gels. That’s not an issue for me, but even using the smaller gels, I was aware that I was wearing a hearing aid after a few hours, as I started to feel mild discomfort.  

The charging case is great for travel, but it is extremely large.  A carrying case is included that is much smaller, but if you are planning on traveling for a long time, you’d still need to bring the charging case separately.  

--- APPROVAL ---
Overall, using these hearing aids is helpful for a full workday.  Because of how obtrusive the charging case is, traveling with them can be cumbersome."
118,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,"Great quality, after you get used to the quirks.","Last Wednesday, I decided I was going to wear these for a quick 5k run. I've done this very same test with other hearing aids I've tried in the past and pretty much every set of earbuds I've ever had. I was excited for run club, got off work in time to get there without having to catch up or go out on my own, the fit of these hearing aids in daily wear around the neighborhood and in the office had me believe that they'd do an amazing job keeping wind noise at bay and allow me to hear those around me clearly. This is how they performed in all those situations: crystal clear voices, music was crisp and clean, little to no wind noise, and the microphones are on the earbud, not the receiver on top of the ear. Sadly, I was not able to use them as I left them in the charging case after having charged them... which meant they had been on for over a day, slowly draining the battery and making them unusable for my run. That test is now meant for a different day. The moral of the story is, with these hearing aids, MAKE SURE YOU TURN THEM OFF!

Overall, I absolutely love the fit, the styling, the sound quality for music and general world noise. These are some top-notch hearing aids that I would absolutely recommend to someone with more mild and situational hearing loss. I use them when we go out into crowded spaces, restaurants, bars, etc. They are fantastic, just a little quirky. Read the manual a few times, play with all the settings and enjoy the very easy to use app! I'm sure I'll make the mistake of leaving them in the charger after unplugging it again, that case is the only reason I am deducting one star, when they're done charging, the hearing aids are ""on"" and will remain that way until you turn them off or they run out of battery. Honestly a minor issue that will likely (hopefully) be fixed in a software update. 

You can't beat the sound quality and comfort of these, way to go Sennheiser! Highly recommend!"
118,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Just a hair shy of absolutely & totally fabulous!,"I’m in my early 50s & have mild hearing degradation; my wife is in her early 60s & suffers from moderate & noticeable hearing loss. We already tried some earbud-style “personal hearing amplifiers,” but found they yielded an unnatural, overly processed quality to voices in particular—the one thing both of us struggle with the most during conversations & TVs/movies. Then along comes these hearing aids, with a Sennheiser pedigree to boot, so we thought we’d give them a try before biting the bullet & sinking the equivalent of 3-4 mortgage payments into a set of prescription aids.

All I can say is…WOW, these aids totally deliver on their promises!

Unboxing is straightforward. You get a USB wall charger, charging cable, 3 sets of ear tips, a charging case with cleaning brush, zippered pocket case, & six “wax guard” applicators along with the hearing aids themselves.

The Clear Slims have a traditional hearing aid form factor with a behind-the-ear stem attached to a forming wire that feeds down into the earpiece. The behind-the-ear control stems are shockingly thin compared to traditional hearing aids we’ve seen & will likely hide neatly behind all but the tiniest outer ear (like my wife’s).Each stem has a single button that is easy to find by feel alone—thankfully it presses easily so you don’t feel like you’re dislodging the aids while operating them. Unfortunately, the forming wire and earpieces are mostly silver rather than flesh-tone which might be an issue if you’re a bit self-conscious about wearing hearing aids.

The clamshell charging case has a push-button closure to keep the case secure/aids protected. There is a small power LED at the back of the case while all other LED status indicators (battery level, charging, & pairing indicators) are on the stems of the hearing aids. The case is cavernous, supposedly to accommodate a drying capsule as well as the hearing aids; this is mentioned in the manual, but not pictured, so I don’t know what that solution looks like or what drying capsules are recommended (the FAQ simply says they’re available from a “hearing care professional”).

To get a personalized sound profile installed on the aids, you need to use Sennhesier’s companion app. The app requires you to have or create an account, but once you’re in, the setup wizard is very user-friendly with easy-to-understand instructions/easy-to-follow pictures that guide you through everything from fitment to pairing to sound adjustment including tweaks for volume as well as clarity. The sound profile is saved to the aids so you don’t have to be near your phone (or connected to it) to leverage the adjustments you’ve made.

You can tailor the sound further in the app by mirroring sound levels in both hearing aids or balance levels separately. There are also advanced sound controls including a 3-band (bass, mid, treble) graphic EQ & a wind noise reduction toggle. True to the Sennheiser name, once you feed the Clear Slims BT music from a phone or DAP, you are treated to an articulate, detailed, & imminently listenable musical performance. I would characterize the sound as leaning towards neutral/bright, similar to the “Sennheiser house sound” I’ve heard with other Senny headphones/buds. Bass extension is capable but isn’t as chest thumping as you might enjoy from some high-quality earbuds or headphones. Still, they offer an engaging & pleasant-enough experience that you can let the Clear Slims serve double duty if you want to spin up some tunes without changing out your hearing aids. You can even use them for phone calls just like regular BT earbuds–the dual mics on each earpiece do a great job of picking up your voice so callers can easily hear you, while on-ear controls allow for call answer, reject, & hanging up.

The Clear Slims have two sound modes that can be toggled in the app or on the aids themselves: Automatic & Live Music. We don’t have any concerts on the docket for several months, but I cranked up a live recording on my home theater & it seemed as if the Live Music setting attenuated some of the harsher upper registers of human voices & offered less aggressive overall amplification. There is a third sound mode for TV which routes audio from your TV/receiver directly to the hearing aids, rather than amplifying the sound coming from the speakers, but it is only available with Sennheiser’s TV Connector (currently $349 on Sennheiser’s website). It looks as if the TV Connector for the Clear Slims is not the same as the one used for their other TV audio products so a separate purchase is likely going to be necessary even if you have already invested in a Sennheiser wireless TV audio product. 

Finally, the big question of the day is how well do they work as hearing aids…in a word, wonderful! The Clear Slims do not seem to *unnaturally* boost or target specific frequencies to the point where sound becomes distorted, overly processed/tinny, or unrealistic. I don’t know what kind of voodoo Sennheiser uses to add both volume & clarity without feeling like anything is missing or overblown, but the result in use is simply an abundance of natural, enjoyable, & intelligible sound. In the evenings, I can now turn the receiver down a full 10dB & my wife can PERFECTLY hear & enjoy everything we’re watching on TV…and for the first time in years, I can speak at a normal volume, or even something close to a whisper, around the corner & outside of the room & my wife can still hear my every word…it’s been a game-changer!

There are a few gotchas you might want to be aware of, especially given the price point. First, when charging in the case, the hearing aids are held in place by two small but VERY potent spring-loaded plates that cover part of the openings to the charging slots. It’s a very unforgiving design that provides a lot of security while the aids are in place, but proves much more difficult to use than it should be. Until we realized you have to exert a little lateral pressure towards you, & not just downward pressure into the charging slots per se, we had a heck of a time getting the aids to seat into the charger at all…a few times, we simply gave up & just turned them off for the night rather than charging them.

Speaking of the case, it is a charger only…there is no internal battery to juice the hearing aids on the go. They will automatically turn on (and connect to your phone if within range) when you remove them, but the aids are only muted when you insert them into the case, they do not automatically turn off when they are seated on the charging contacts. It’s a small detail, but it makes a difference if you don’t have the case plugged in when you stow the aids away as they will continue to drain the battery if you forget to turn them off.

Not having used other hearing aids in the past, I can’t be sure if this is typical, but in our experience, these little guys squeal LOUDLY if your fingers get really close to the earpiece or accidentally press them a little too hard while fitting them into the ear canals. 

Sennheiser includes six wax guard applicators in the package. Most people are probably familiar with cleaning wax off the eartips & driver openings of regular BT earbuds–I thought maybe that’s what these wax guard sticks were for. But the Clear Slims have an additional protective cap over the earpiece openings to prevent wax buildup/ingress. According to the manual, you should change the wax guards every 3-4 months. The idea is to use one end of the applicator to GENTLY remove the existing wax guard cap, flip the applicator over, place the new cap housed in the other end over the opening, then discard the applicator stick. You have enough here to last you about 1.5-2 years if you follow Sennheiser’s schedule, but it is an added maintenance wrinkle you have to remember to do & an extra (minor) expense you may not have seen coming. 

On-ear controls offer many functions: volume +/-, call answer/reject/hang up, change sound mode, power on/off, but you only have one button per earpiece, and the manual is often confusing about button presses and timing. For example, some functions require a “quick” button press of <2 seconds, but others require a “quick” button press of >2 seconds, while others require a button press (no “quick”) of <2 seconds–oh, and many functions appear to use the same combinations of button presses/timing. Someone really needs to edit the manual to make sure “quick” is used consistently with the proper greater-than/less-than symbols because the instructions are all over the place. Also, if you happen to hold down one of the buttons too long trying to turn it off, on, or pair the earpiece, you can accidentally put it into “storage mode” where the aid becomes completely unresponsive and won’t even light up when charging. I had to contact support thinking one of the aids had burned out! NOTE: if this happens to you, hold down the button for 15-20 seconds to take the aid out of storage mode. 

Finally, despite the pleasant & natural sound they offer for the world around you, there is a noticeable sidetone for your own voice that can border on distracting. Specifically, the sound of your own voice is not only amplified, it echoes as well. In the end, it’s a small price to pay for better hearing all around, but it does take some time to get used to during a conversation.

Despite these observations & reservations, we’re still incredibly happy with the Sennheiser All-Day Clear Slims. There are a few things we need to get used to with this particular device, although that’s likely true of anyone’s transition to hearing aids. But given her more noticeable hearing degradation over mine, the improvement in my wife’s quality of life thanks to the Clear Slim hearing aids is nothing short of amazing. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
118,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,"Good, but not great.","They're not awful, but not amazing.  For the price, I'd say they come in the mid/mid-high range.  The battery life is good, and they charge quickly with the included USB-C.  The carrying case was an issue for me in safety-not that i'd lose them, but proper storage/travel.  The biggest issue was the fit and functionality.  When paired with the cell phone, calls were answered with some navigation, and conversations were crystal clear.  When answering a device/phone not paired with the aids, the amplification was insufficient.  This was a deal breaker, unfortunately."
118,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,These are a pleasure to use,"I’m a male in my mid-50s with medically documented mild hearing loss.  The opportunity to use the Sennheiser - All-Day Clear Slim hearing aids is exciting, but my results after a few days of sporadic use is a mixed bag.

Setup is straightforward.  Using the included charger and cable, charging takes up to 3 hours.  I took this opportunity to download the All-Day Clear app and create my account with Sennheiser.  The app guides you through setup and fitting.  Helpful reminders and tips are delivered via notifications on the phone.  

At the end of the day, the hearing aids fit securely in the charging cradle and they’re ready to go the next morning.  I’ve had no issues with battery life.  They easily last all day.

The Sennheiser - All-Day Clear Slim come with small, medium, and large ear tips.  Finding the right fit was easy.  I appreciate that these tips rest outside the ear canal; that really enhances long-term comfort.  The forming wire that wraps over the top of the ear is easily shaped to hold securely while remaining unobtrusive.

Each hearing aid (Left and Right) connects separately to your phone’s Bluetooth.  The sound control settings available via the app are simple and easy to understand.  Hearing aid volume is controlled via an in-app slider.  There is also the ability to control each ear’s volume separately, and a basic equalizer to control Bass, Mid, and Treble. (See accompanying photos).

The Sennheiser - All-Day Clear Slim are comfortable and easy to wear for hours at a time.  Present but not intrusive.

Being connected to my phone, I am able to listen to music and movies, anything I might normally listen to.  This is welcome and convenient, but I’ll stick to my usual active noise cancelling earbuds for extended music playback and entertainment.  The Sennheiser - All-Day Clear Slim hearing aids sound okay in this use but cannot compete with the dynamic range of a dedicated pair of quality earbuds.

One pleasant surprise is the ability to make and receive calls while using these hearing aids.  Calls can be initiated with the usual voice commands, and there are also buttons on the hearing aid earpiece (the part behind the ear) that can initiate/answer/end calls.  Incoming sound quality is excellent, and people on the other end of the call tell me I sound good.  I find that I need to stay within about 15 feet of my phone, or call/connection quality suffers.

I said at the start that my experience with the Sennheiser - All-Day Clear Slim has been a mixed bag.  

Pros:  In a quiet environment like an office or meeting, I have been very pleased with their performance.  Take the time to adjust volume and equalizer to suit your needs, and the difference is apparent.  I can now clearly hear coworkers that I have previously struggled to decipher.  This is a huge positive difference.

Cons: In a noisier setting, like my family room with an oscillating fan in the corner set on medium, I find the constant hum of the fan very distracting.  So far, I haven’t found EQ or volume settings to compensate for the unwanted sound amplification.  I have had the same experience while trying to have a conversation while the television was a little too loud.  Basically, it seems to come down to competing sounds, and I have the feeling that I’ll need to be patient while my ears/brain learn to make sense of the additional input.

Overall, I am very impressed with the quality of the Sennheiser - All-Day Clear Slim hearings aids, both in build and function.  I’m looking forward to improved hearing and comprehension without the need to consult my audiologist."
118,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,It Helps to Hear!,"Sennheiser - All-Day Clear Slim - OTC Self-Fitting Hearing Aids

I have been using hearing aids for a number of years so I jumped at the chance to test and evaluate these Over the Counter (OTC) Hearing Aids. They can be acquired without a visit to an audiologist. Also, they are sold at a fraction of a price that an audiologist would prescribe. I know - I have tried both. 

These hearing aids fit behind the ear with a tube that fits inside the ear. I find the aids that fit directly into the ear a bit more comfortable, especially since I need glasses. The comfort level when wearing these aids is acceptable, perhaps due to the slimmer fit behind the ear.

These hearing aids come with a case that stores and charges them, so no batteries are needed. The aids must be inserted correctly in order to charge. The case has a lid and I recommend not closing the lid. There are small light indicators indicating battery strength and Bluetooth connectivity.

Bluetooth connectivity can be a great help when connecting to electronics and TV's that support it. Much appreciated, thank you.

The software that supports these hearing aids are support by Apple or Google phone apps. The setup process is easy to understand as it walks you through it. The software also includes  the ability to tweak and adjust to an individual needs.

I gave these hearing aids a 5 star rating. Hearing aids are no fun but for me, a necessity. These hearings are not perfect, but they are very good and they are affordable."
118,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"Hear, hear - yes they do! - nice Hearing OTC aid","The Sennheiser - All-Day Clear Slim - OTC Self-Fitting Hearing Aid for Mild to Moderate Hearing Loss – All-Day Wear & Bluetooth – in Gray is a well designed and engineered hearing system. The specifications put it in the top of the OTC (over the counter) class of hearing aids. One of the key specifications that impressed me is the Ingress Protection (IP) Rating of IP68 which means they have enviable dust and water incursion prevention – basically they are what I would call waterproof. Sennheiser has been making audio devices since 1945 and has a great reputation. 

They have given me all day use (around 16 hours), including listening to Bluetooth streamed music. Charging takes several hours which I do overnight.

They are not intrusive looking from an esthetic point of view. 

The carrying case is bulky and does not include internal battery power for charging – needs to be plugged in to a usb charger. 

Its microphone array works well for phone calls while the sound output in the ear is pleasant even for listening to music.

Overall it helps my aural discrimination letting me understand what is being spoken. They are light and stay in place. Great product."
118,BestBuy,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,"Comfortable and well built, but disappointing.","Years ago I was in an accident that left me with mild hearing damage.  At that time, you could only get hearing aids via a prescription, and they cost several thousands of dollars.  Insurance wouldn’t cover it, and my hearing issues were not so severe that I really needed a full-on pair of them to live a day-to-day life. With recent laws changed though, you can now buy hearing aids over the counter, and tons are popping up to give people with mild to moderate hearing issues some more affordable options.

I’ve tried a couple of “cheap” models and they frankly did very little for me, so the Sennheiser Slim Hearing Aids were presented for me to try.  They are not inexpensive per se, but still cost half or more than half LESS than prescription style hearing aids.  These are more traditional in appearance, with a main unit sliding behind your ear, and a small tube wrapping around the top of your ear to an earpiece.  These are thinner than some, and the earpiece on this model doesn’t actually stick deep into your ear, but more rests on the outer part of your ear.  They come as a pair, are rechargeable (so no stocking up on tiny batteries – yay!), and sit in a nice case when not in use or charging. A padded travel case and cleaning kit are also included.

It takes a couple of hours or so to charge these.  You then can download their “All Day Clear”  app to any Apple or Android device that allows you to fine tune and adjust the setting on them, and I do suggest you do this as you really won’t get anywhere close to the full benefits from them unless you can adjust them. You need to create an account on the app.  After a little while I barely noticed they were on my ears as again, these are a little thinner than similar style models. They connect via Bluetooth to the app.  You can adjust volume, the sound type you may be around in a particular area so they pick different sounds up better with different settings, etc.  The omnidirectional mics on them get an ok range from varied directions.  You can adjust the volume of each side and adjust for music or standard sounds, and a fine tune area lets you adjust via sliders the bass, mid-range, and treble.  More on the results below, but there’s a bit of disappointment. They are rated for around 16 hours of use with a full charge which is pretty accurate so far, but if you spend a ton of time making adjustments and cranking the volume up more, you may get a little less. You can also stream music through these or even take/make phone calls, but that drains the battery much faster. Still, you do get a decent amount of runtime on them in hearing aid mode, and not having to buy those little hearing aid batteries will save money.

Unfortunately, there’s a few disappointments with these in my use.  First, while they DO allow me to hear a greater range of tones (high to low), no matter how I adjust or fine tune them in the app, the sound is still pretty “tinny” or hollow.  If I crank up the mid-range enough to make things sound more normal, then the range (distance it picks up) drops.  And while the upper and lower ranges were improved, the overall ability to hear volume wise actually seemed to go DOWN for me, even cranked up to nearly full.  Also, it says you need to press-hold the button the back of each until you see a red light to fully then them “off” before putting back in the main case for storage or charging. I did so, and noticed later my phone wasn’t getting any sound at all in another room – it was still connected to the aids. So even turning them off, placing them back into the case turned them on again and I had to turn them off again while they were inside the case.  Taking them out automatically turns them back on (this part, is normal).

Each person with hearing loss issues will have different types of issues or levels.  Again, these are designed for low to moderate hearing loss and are not prescription-level hearing aids.  That being said, with my own personal issues, I didn’t see any better results with these than I have experienced with other models that cost much less.  As a side-note, I did allow a good friend who has poor hearing in one ear to try one on when he came over, and his comments were similar… tinny, lower volume even on high, hollow sounding, etc.  My rating however, is based solely on my own experience with these.  While they are certainly better than no hearing aid at all, I’m afraid I cannot recommend the Sennheiser Slim aids based on their benefit per their retail cost."

118,BestBuy,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Disappointing,"Disappointing.  That’s the best word to describe these. When you have a hearing aid made by an established, respected maker of hearing aids and sold through their highly respected consumer audio division, you have certain expectations. And at this price point, those expectations absolutely should be met. They are not.

Let me start with a basic statement on hearing loss. Hearing loss is an individual issue – everyone’s loss is different. This is particularly true in the frequencies that are impacted, both in terms of what the frequencies are and how bad the loss is at each frequency. 

Let’s start with the basics. Opening the surprisingly large package reveals a surprisingly large docking station for recharging. There’s also a smaller carry case, but with no ability to recharge from it. Opening the charging case reveals a slim, although not small, pair of hearing aids. You’ll have to charge them right away, as the case discharges at a surprisingly fast rate when the hearing aids are inserted. Once charged, the first thing you’re likely to notice is that the case is making a whistling noise. This is feedback, and the only way to get it to stop is to open the case and remove the hearing aids before closing it again.

The design has some interesting features. As the name notes, these units are slim, but they’re not small. (I’ve included a few comparison photos so you can gauge the size of these versus the Go Ultra and a professional Widex model.) While this may make them look unusual, the fit is quite comfortable and I found the slim design allowed them to pair well with my glasses. The microphones are also in the in-ear receiver rather than on the body of the unit. This approach is more like a completely in-ear design microphone. While it worked well, this design choice also causes the in-ear receiver to stick out more, making the hearing aid more noticeable than some more conventional designs.

The hearing aids come with an app, of course. Connecting and setting up is straight-forward, once the app stops crashing. The app crashed twice on me during connection and forced me to start over. I’m using an iPhone running the latest release, so there really is no excuse for this. 

Once the app finally allowed me to do the setup, it had me wear the hearing aids so that it could program them. This is the next design fail. The app allowed me to set volume, balance, and bass/mid/treble. This is not nearly enough detail to cover the nuance of individual hearing loss patterns, and Sonova / Sennheiser should know this. A good hearing aid, particularly at this price point, should tailor your experience to your specific loss pattern. The app did identify that I had a significant discrepancy in the loss level across the ears and recommended I see a medical professional, which is the right recommendation. 

Once they were in and programmed, the sound was clear and without delay (some competing models have slower chips that deliver a slightly delayed sound, making you feel like you’re perpetually stuck in a badly dubbed foreign movie). Unfortunately, the clear sound was overwhelmed by the lack of specific frequency control. If I turned it up loud enough the hear my girlfriend speak, then the dog barking was so loud it caused pain. If I set it to where the dog bark was comfortable, then I couldn’t hear my girlfriend or most other humans.

Of these hearing aids were 1/3 this price, I would still consider the design flaws, and particularly the lack of more precise settings, tuned by a proper in-home hearing test, unacceptable. At this price point and coming from an established hearing aid manufacturer, it’s downright inexcusable."
118,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,I like the fit and appearance,"The sound quality is clear. The all-day clear slim hearing aids app was easy to download and use. I like that I can answer my calls with the hearing aids. But I had some difficulty with controlling the volume you have to increase with the right aid and decrease with the left aid. I like the hearing aids wear ability, I get to wear them all day."
118,BestBuy,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,Not Good Enough,"I gave these a try, considering they were about 2k less than the Signia model I eventually got from  the regular hearing Doctor. Since I have severe hearing loss in the left ear, these just didn't give me enough boost. I have just moderate loss in the right ear so the extra high frequency allowed me to hear the leaves crunch and the birds chirp. But, comparing the two, I had to go back to the original high dollar hearing aids. They are smaller, sound clearer, and fit better. These Sennheisers should be good for you if you have moderate hearing loss."
118,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Good but not good enough,"Yes there is a lot of good to be said for these hearing aids. I like that the controls for these hearing aids can be pared to your cell phone for controlling volume and pitch control. They definitely helped in my hearing. On the bad side I did not like that they showed up so much on my ear. I am a white older man and the hearing aids are black colored and they are big so they show up very much. If I was a girl, I could cover them with longer hair. The ear part that fits in my ear canal was too big so they fit just barely okay. Most other hearing aids come with extra ear buds of different sizes so they will fit better. I did like the free trial period that Best Buy offered, that was nice."

118,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Pretty darn good...,"The Sennheiser - All-Day Clear Slim - OTC Self-Fitting Hearing Aids have been…well, they’ve been a blessing.  To be able to hear more in a social setting is wonderful.  I’m using the phrase, “I’m sorry, what?” much less.  I appreciate that.  My family appreciates that.

The All-Day Clear Slims, like any hearing device, will take some time to get used to.  Incoming sound/voices seem to have a bit of a ‘canned’ quality.  I figure that’s going to take time for my brain to work out — and for me to fine tune as time goes on.  One thing that has made this experience much easier to deal with is the setup and controlling capabilities of the All-Day Clear mobile app.  It was one of the least tedious, easy setups that I have experienced with OTC hearing aids.  Thank you, Sennheiser.

Over time, I can only imagine that I’ll be using the app less and less.  Right now, it’s great to have total command as I continue to become familiar with them.  I can fine tune balance, volume, and tone (with an EQ) in either a split fashion, or both left and right together.  My set has two sound settings — Automatic, which seems to adjust incoming sound based upon your surroundings (like in a constantly changing social setting), and what Sennheiser calls the Live Music setting.  This setting seems to take everything in just as it is.  I have found myself having the Automatic setting on during most of the day.  When I’m relaxing in the evening and watching the TV or a movie, I prefer the Live Music setting…fewer sounds/voices dropping out and then returning.  Everything seems to stay more constant.  This is all kind of hard to explain.  You need to experience it yourself.

There are a couple things I wish were different —  

I wish the charging case had an internal battery to charge the aids overnight.  As it is, the case does need to be plugged in via USB-C.

I wish the receiver buds were tan or semi-translucent instead of black.  Less noticeable.

I wish the connective wire from the main body to the ear bud was just a tad bit longer — but that’s just the ‘design’ of my earlobe.

Even with all this in mind, these are darn good hearing aids.  Try ‘em out.  You’ll want to check with Sennheiser, but I believe that they offer a 30-day trial period…and with these, you don’t have to buy any hearing aid batteries ever again!"

First of all, I must highlight the exceptional sound quality it offers. The bass is deep and powerful, while the treble is clear and precise, providing a most enjoyable listening experience. Plus, its slim, sleek design makes it very comfortable to wear throughout the day, without putting undue pressure on my ears. I'm also impressed with the battery life, which allows for extended use without having to worry about constantly recharging. Finally, I appreciate the noise reduction feature, which allows me to fully enjoy my music by filtering out external distractions. In short, the Sennheiser All Day Clear Slim product is a perfect choice for all women wishing to combine style, comfort and exceptional sound quality."

Sennheiser - All-Day Clear Slim - OTC Self-Fitting Hearing Aid

I was looking for three main features in an OTC hearing aid: rechargeable, Bluetooth connectivity, and quality of sound. I found them all in these hearing aids. Sennheiser is world famous for their audio products, so I was banking on them putting their name on these *only* if they met strict quality standards. I was not disappointed. 

They’re light weight and easy to handle. Since they have a behind-the-ear component, the portion that goes into your ear is small and comfortable. The part that goes behind your ear is nearly invisible and has simple controls for changing volume and taking phone calls. The connecting wire is soft, but bendable and makes it easy to fit the aids to your liking. They feel secure, but with their open air design, not like some aids that feel stuffed in your ears. Also, they come with three earpiece sizes to fit each ear nicely.

Connecting the aids to your phone is easy with the app, which is also very straightforward. Once paired, a simple hearing preference test locks in your settings until you want to change them. The Bluetooth connectivity lets you listen to music (with quite nice sound quality!) or make and take phone calls. It’s important to note that the 16 hour battery life pertains to using the aids for hearing assistance, but using Bluetooth will only give you a few hours of battery life.

Charging the aids is easy with the enclosed charging case. Red, yellow and green indicators keep you up to date on charging progress. Taking the aids out of the charger turns them on and connects them to your phone. The app lets you adjust the overall volume or set it separately for each ear. You can fine tune the equalization with bass, mid tone, and treble sliders. Audio signals let you know when the batteries are running low.

Finally, due to their construction, sound is enhanced without sounding “canned” or artificial. The mixture of sound traveling directly to your ears combined with the amplified sound comes across as very natural."
118,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,i like this hearing aid,"I have to say that I am really impressed with the Sennheiser All Day Clear Slim product. With my regular small hearing losses, it is often difficult for me to fully enjoy my favorite music or follow a conversation clearly. However, since I started using this headset, my life has really changed. Its thin and lightweight design makes it extremely comfortable to wear all day, without any discomfort. Additionally, the exceptional sound clarity I get from these headphones is simply amazing. The bass is powerful and deep, and the highs are clear and crisp. Even when I'm in a noisy environment, the headphones manage to filter out the noise and give me a great hearing experience. I am truly grateful to have discovered the Sennheiser All Day Clear Slim, as it has improved my quality of life significantly. I highly recommend it to anyone with hearing problems as it really does make a huge difference."
118,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,VERY WELL MADE!,"I have been looking at OTC hearing aids for a while, I am a retired police officer.  And for 20 years I was a firearms instructor, the majority of that time I only used the soft foam, moldable in ear hearing protection.  Now I’m paying the price, my hearing is not what it used to be.  

I first off want to mention how well these are packaged by Sennheiser, the outer box was a mess, it looked as if it had been crushed and I was worried about the product inside.  But once I opened it and removed the inner box I realized they were not, due to the fact that Sennheiser put forth a lot of effort in packaging these hearing aids.  JOB WELL DONE1

Before I received these I downloaded the All-Day Clear app and registered for a new account.  When they arrived I was surprised that they were 77% charged. The initial setup w/ the app and the hearing aids was very easy.  It took about 2-3 minutes and I had them connected to my phone by bluetooth.  I took the time to try on the included soft, gel tips to find just the right fit for me.  I settled on the medium in my left ear and the small in my right.  My problem is that no matter what I do, whether its w/ these Sennheiser All-Day Clear Slim fearing aids or just in-ear headphones, God made my right ear different from the left as far as the canal is concerned.  My point is I never have a problem w/ my left ear, but my right ear after about an hour or so, I begin to experience ear fatigue.  And it gets to the point that I have to remove it.  It was the same w/ these.  That is no fault of the company, it’s just me.

As far as the product, its is VERY well made!  These are lightweight, that was the first thing that I noticed when I removed them from the case.  My wife and I rode our golf cart after I had the tips on and the hearing aids wire adjusted.  I chose the wind noise reduction setting, but I still had a lot of wind noise in both ears, not a big deal but it was noticeable.  When we arrived at home my wife was doing laundry and I was reading/listening to the television.  And I had the volume set to what I “normally” have it set on and immediately I had to turn it down.  I realized then that I really need hearing aids.  I was amazed, because I could hear.  My wife came out of the laundry room and asked why I turned the volume down and I told her that it was a bit overwhelming.  And it was/is.  I was hearing “noises” I had been missing.  I was shocked to hear the water discharging from the washing machine, I had never heard that.  I heard my wife running water in the kitchen sin, again, I hadn’t heard that.  And then, the ear pain started and I removed them for the night and charged them.  I went to Church the next morning and I was pleasantly surprised how well I could hear, again, I heard sounds, noises, voices, etc., that I hadn’t been used to hearing.  And the adjustability on the app makes fine tuning these to fit your need and surroundings so simple.  JOB WELL DONE!

The fit, other than my right ear is great.  No one has noticed (if they have they haven’t mentioned it) that I have these in.  They are sleek and when Sennheiser says “Slim” they aren’t kidding.  I was pleased how well they stayed in and allowed me to hear again.  Take the time to mold the wire to fit around the front part of the ear and they are truly not very noticeable.  The soft case that Sennheiser includes in the package is a great benefit for me, I put it in my pocket and when the ear fatigue starts I will take them out, I’ve tried leaving the left hearing aid in, but its hard to explain but I just don’t like the results, its as if I’m turning my head to the right to compensate and it becomes overwhelming.  My hope is that the more I wear these and get more accustomed to that “overwhelming” feeling that my ear fatigue will go away.  Because these Sennheiser All-Day Clear Slim have opened my eyes to how much I had lost in my hearing.  

JOB WELL DONE!"
118,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Easy to adjust,"It is nice to have hearing assistance and also be able to answer the phone or listen to music without having to switch between devices. It is a bit more obvious that I have something in my ear than other hearing assistance devices I have used, but most people assume it is an ear bud. It is convenient to be able to adjust the different levels if I want more or less bass for example I can use my phone to dial in when seems right for me. Not having something in my ear canal makes it more comfortable, although more obvious to others. The set up took a little bit, but was doable. Overall it is nice to have a little bit of assistance when I want it without having to go get an ear exam. I can adjust the settings depending on my environment. It is nice because if I know there is someones voice that I want to hear I can work at adapting the settings to be ideal for that voice to help me pick it out from the surrounding noises. The background adaption is a nice feature that helps balance levels."

118,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,So Far... So Good,"I've tried audiologist tuned AI style hearing aids for over $4000 and I've tried the $100 ""guaranteed"" cheapos and both were terrible. Enter the middle ground: Sennheiser All Day Cleaer Slim. I've used them for almost two months and as long as I keep them on ""Live Music"" mode, they're great. I can hear so much better. The other ""automatic"" mode or whatever it's called, filters out too much of the things I WANT to hear. If I want that, I'll go back to the $4000 AI model. So... it's liveable. What I LOVE is that calls, music, streaming video audio all come through clear and clean and at enough volume that I can actually enjoy telephone conversations again. I don't like the behind the ear thing. It feels like I'm going to lose them from time to time, but they work better than the in-the-ear units I tried before. So Far... So Good"
118,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"Comfortable to wear, definitely aids hearing","Downloaded the All-Day Clear app.  The intro, e.g. user agreement was so lengthy, it seemed like I was reading a manual!  Next, I had to create an account.  This included agreeing to them processing my data.  What data do they need for me to use hearing aids!  You have to provide a real email or phone number as they will send a verification code for you to complete the account creation process.  Next is the process of pairing via Bluetooth with your phone.  It took a couple of tries and then they paired.  Streaming a video or listening to music on the phone, the Sennheiser hearing aids work pretty well. This is true for phone conversations including conference calls I do from the phone.  Normally I have the volume all the way up, with the hearing aids I was able to hear well at about 50% volume.  At first I didn’t think the hearing aids were working without the phone.  I didn’t think they helped with the TV.  With a little time I found the TV was too loud and kept turning it down.  It’s now at about 40% of the volume it was when I wasn’t wearing the hearing aids.  They do the job.  I do get some feedback if I touch my ears.  Why am I touching ears?  To make sure they are still in my ears!  They are so comfortable I don’t even realize I am wearing them.  I touch my ears to check if they are there and then I get feedback so I know yes they are there!  At first, I got a beep here and there and I didn’t know why.  I got a notification on my phone that says that is normal.  I think the hearing aids are tuning themselves."
118,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Excellent choice!,"The Sennheiser - All-Day Clear Slim - OTC Self-Fitting Hearing Aid is an excellent OTC choice if you have the need.

My 72 year old mom moved in with us a couple years ago and both the wife and I (as well as our late-teens kids) noticed a gradual increase in TV and nusic volume coming from the basement. That in combination with us noticing an increasing presence of her asking for clarification during conversations, we were able to convince her that she may want to consider looking into hearing aids. She finally agreed and we are ALL so glad she did!

Inside the box, you'll find the usual suspects... The hearing aids, charger, cable, multiple tips, cleaning kit and a nice bonus of a casNiether of them being overly technical, I was impressed with how (relatively) quickly they had the hearing aids going.

As for quality, Sennheiser is universally recognized towards the upper end in consumer grade devices. This Clear Slim has a quality feel, look and design. 

End of the day mom loves them! she admitted she did not realiuze quite how far her hearing loss became. The conversations have been more engaging and theTV/music from the basement has almost dissapeared.

I wouldreccomend them to a friend!"
118,BestBuy,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,Can you hear me clearly and cleanly now?,"This hearing aid, available over the counter and without prescription, will improve the lifestyle of someone with mild to moderate hearing loss, but not as well as many speciality hearing aids available through an audiologist. Miniaturization in technology continues to improve and I was hoping that this could be a breakthrough product to help more people to engage in the world more comfortably. Unfortunately, it’s not quite there yet.

Set up:
Sennheiser requires installing their ‘All-Day Clear’ app to your phone for set up. This is used to create a sound profile. Unfortunately, the app crashed once (after 10 minutes ‘pending’), which made the set up take longer. On the second attempt, the aids were set up properly. Another annoyance was a warning to see a professional when I set the left gain higher than the right gain. I’d been to an audiologist in the past and know that my hearing is worse on the left side. I don’t need Sennheiser to remind me of that!

After using it for a couple of hours, I wanted to tweak some of the settings to make certain situations easier to deal with. Unfortunately, the app required me to set up the hearing aids again from scratch in order to ‘Update’ the settings. I had to write down what the settings were initially so I could have a reference point from which to work. It certainly would have been simpler to be able to tweak the settings directly instead of having to remember or write it down.

Appearance:
It was pointed out to me that the black backing to the ear buds was very visible in my ears, along with the wire heading to the ear bud from the outside portion. While hearing loss is not something to be embarrassed about, I’m not keen on how clearly this pair highlights itself to showcase that I’m wearing something. While I was out and about, I did hear someone say they through I was wearing ear buds, which was odd for someone my age.

Usage (TV / Computer / Phone):
After a couple of attempts, I was able to connect the hearing aids to my computer. At first, it did not appear in the list of bluetooth devices. After putting the hearing aids back in the case, then taking them out again, they conencted. Once connected, the sound quality was decent and clear from the PC. I also tried to connect the ‘TV mode’ on the hearing aid to my TV. I have an external bluetooth adapter for the TV, which is driven from the optical audio out. I’ve used this witth a personal surround speaker from Sony (great product) and which had been a godsend for allowing me to raise the volume for myself without disburbing those around me. I was hoping the adapter would connect to the hearing aids, but it did not. 

Connecting to phone audio was easier in some ways. I was able to get music playing through the hearing aids and they sounded as good as the computer with decent frequency range. Howver, when I got a call, I wasn’t able to get that to connect directly. I ended up using the speakerphone on my cell or my caller wasn’t able to hear me.

Usage (Conversation):
Sennhieser has done a decent job of rejecting ambient noise and focusing on a close conversation. It was certainly a big improvement over not using anything (and my shouting to others as I coudn’t hear myself). From talking to others about their experience, however, they’ve noted useful features on their hearing aids such as frequency shift, music pause, and overall clearer hearing.

Overall:
Hearing is a very personal experience. No two people lose their hearing in the same way. A specialist adds value in helping to tune a hearing aid and help you use it most effectively. They will also help you pick the right one for the features you want. While this comes at a price, I think that price is worth it when considering how long and how often hearing aids will get used. Sennheiser has done an admirable job of creating a hearing aid at a value price point. It’s just not the one for me."
118,BestBuy,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,"Good quality , but not clearly remarkable.","Firstly I am a Best Bujy Tech Insider and I did receive these Sennheiser All-Day Clear Slim hearing aids for the putpose of review.

I am a long time hearing aid user, so I
have experience with hearing aids of which all have deficiencies and these Sennheiser All-Day Clear Slims are no excreption.

I like the build quality. The heavy bendable wire is a good asset as it helps keep the hearing aid on your ear in the case of the ear insert comming out. I like the app, it installed easily and quides you in the setup of the hearing aids. the volume of each side can be individually controlled or they can be merged as one. There is an audio equalizer, but it has limited adjustments. It comes with three sizes  of ear inserts.

The battery life is all day if you only use them as hearing aids, If you use it for streaming audio from a phone, tablet or laptop, battery life will be rather limited. The charging case does not have a battery for charging so it will have to be plugged in for charging.It comes with a decent user manual and extra wax guards and the tool to replace them. 

What needs to be made clear is that although they are Blue Tooth, you can't connect them to your TV without buying a rather expensive adapter that then connects with the Sennheiser All-Day Slim hearing aids, and that is a real bummer if you were hoping  to be able to stream audio in private from your TV.

What I thought that stood out as a plus was that it didn't seem to exagerate wind noise, creaks and rattles in my older car as my other aids do. While watching TV they seem to not exagerate surrounding  sounds, such as ceiling fans.

They do a decent job streaming audio, but not great unless you hold your fingers over the ear inserts, then they sound like good ear phones. So unless you want to do that or put ear muffs over them, the sound will be a little hollow. It has separate settings for streaming and listening, which they call ""live Music"".

Reviewing hearing aids is not scientific, as they will react differently for each individual. Also you have to give your brain time to learn to process what it receives and turn it into what will eventually sound normal for you.

As hearing aids go and considering what they cost,it is a toss up as to whether I would reccomend them to a friend without reviewing other hearing aids. You can buy a service package that allows you to take they to a hearing aid center or store for adjustment or repair. You can find the cost of that on Sennheiser's website.

I am sorry that I can't be all Rah Rah, or No Way, about these hearing aids, because until I have used them for an extended period, I can not make a certain yay or nay vote on these."
118,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Pretty darn good...,"The Sennheiser - All-Day Clear Slim - OTC Self-Fitting Hearing Aids have been…well, they’ve been a blessing.  To be able to hear more in a social setting is wonderful.  I’m using the phrase, “I’m sorry, what?” much less.  I appreciate that.  My family appreciates that.

The All-Day Clear Slims, like any hearing device, will take some time to get used to.  Incoming sound/voices seem to have a bit of a ‘canned’ quality.  I figure that’s going to take time for my brain to work out — and for me to fine tune as time goes on.  One thing that has made this experience much easier to deal with is the setup and controlling capabilities of the All-Day Clear mobile app.  It was one of the least tedious, easy setups that I have experienced with OTC hearing aids.  Thank you, Sennheiser.

Over time, I can only imagine that I’ll be using the app less and less.  Right now, it’s great to have total command as I continue to become familiar with them.  I can fine tune balance, volume, and tone (with an EQ) in either a split fashion, or both left and right together.  My set has two sound settings — Automatic, which seems to adjust incoming sound based upon your surroundings (like in a constantly changing social setting), and what Sennheiser calls the Live Music setting.  This setting seems to take everything in just as it is.  I have found myself having the Automatic setting on during most of the day.  When I’m relaxing in the evening and watching the TV or a movie, I prefer the Live Music setting…fewer sounds/voices dropping out and then returning.  Everything seems to stay more constant.  This is all kind of hard to explain.  You need to experience it yourself.

There are a couple things I wish were different —  

I wish the charging case had an internal battery to charge the aids overnight.  As it is, the case does need to be plugged in via USB-C.

I wish the receiver buds were tan or semi-translucent instead of black.  Less noticeable.

I wish the connective wire from the main body to the ear bud was just a tad bit longer — but that’s just the ‘design’ of my earlobe.

Even with all this in mind, these are darn good hearing aids.  Try ‘em out.  You’ll want to check with Sennheiser, but I believe that they offer a 30-day trial period…and with these, you don’t have to buy any hearing aid batteries ever again!"

First of all, I must highlight the exceptional sound quality it offers. The bass is deep and powerful, while the treble is clear and precise, providing a most enjoyable listening experience.

I'm also impressed with the battery life, which allows for extended use without having to worry about constantly recharging.

118,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,So Far... So Good,"I've tried audiologist tuned AI style hearing aids for over $4000 and I've tried the $100 ""guaranteed"" cheapos and both were terrible. Enter the middle ground: Sennheiser All Day Cleaer Slim. I've used them for almost two months and as long as I keep them on ""Live Music"" mode, they're great. I can hear so much better. The other ""automatic"" mode or whatever it's called, filters out too much of the things I WANT to hear. If I want that, I'll go back to the $4000 AI model. So... it's liveable. What I LOVE is that calls, music, streaming video audio all come through clear and clean and at enough volume that I can actually enjoy telephone conversations again. I don't like the behind the ear thing. It feels like I'm going to lose them from time to time, but they work better than the in-the-ear units I tried before. So Far... So Good"
118,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"Comfortable to wear, definitely aids hearing","Downloaded the All-Day Clear app.  The intro, e.g. user agreement was so lengthy, it seemed like I was reading a manual!  Next, I had to create an account.  This included agreeing to them processing my data.  What data do they need for me to use hearing aids!  You have to provide a real email or phone number as they will send a verification code for you to complete the account creation process.  Next is the process of pairing via Bluetooth with your phone.  It took a couple of tries and then they paired.  Streaming a video or listening to music on the phone, the Sennheiser hearing aids work pretty well. This is true for phone conversations including conference calls I do from the phone.  Normally I have the volume all the way up, with the hearing aids I was able to hear well at about 50% volume.  At first I didn’t think the hearing aids were working without the phone.  I didn’t think they helped with the TV.  With a little time I found the TV was too loud and kept turning it down.  It’s now at about 40% of the volume it was when I wasn’t wearing the hearing aids.  They do the job.  I do get some feedback if I touch my ears.  Why am I touching ears?  To make sure they are still in my ears!  They are so comfortable I don’t even realize I am wearing them.  I touch my ears to check if they are there and then I get feedback so I know yes they are there!  At first, I got a beep here and there and I didn’t know why.  I got a notification on my phone that says that is normal.  I think the hearing aids are tuning themselves."
118,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Excellent choice!,"The Sennheiser - All-Day Clear Slim - OTC Self-Fitting Hearing Aid is an excellent OTC choice if you have the need.

My 72 year old mom moved in with us a couple years ago and both the wife and I (as well as our late-teens kids) noticed a gradual increase in TV and nusic volume coming from the basement. That in combination with us noticing an increasing presence of her asking for clarification during conversations, we were able to convince her that she may want to consider looking into hearing aids. She finally agreed and we are ALL so glad she did!

Inside the box, you'll find the usual suspects... The hearing aids, charger, cable, multiple tips, cleaning kit and a nice bonus of a casNiether of them being overly technical, I was impressed with how (relatively) quickly they had the hearing aids going.

As for quality, Sennheiser is universally recognized towards the upper end in consumer grade devices. This Clear Slim has a quality feel, look and design. 

End of the day mom loves them! she admitted she did not realiuze quite how far her hearing loss became. The conversations have been more engaging and theTV/music from the basement has almost dissapeared.

I wouldreccomend them to a friend!"
118,BestBuy,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,Can you hear me clearly and cleanly now?,"This hearing aid, available over the counter and without prescription, will improve the lifestyle of someone with mild to moderate hearing loss, but not as well as many speciality hearing aids available through an audiologist. Miniaturization in technology continues to improve and I was hoping that this could be a breakthrough product to help more people to engage in the world more comfortably. Unfortunately, it’s not quite there yet.

Set up:
Sennheiser requires installing their ‘All-Day Clear’ app to your phone for set up. This is used to create a sound profile. Unfortunately, the app crashed once (after 10 minutes ‘pending’), which made the set up take longer. On the second attempt, the aids were set up properly. Another annoyance was a warning to see a professional when I set the left gain higher than the right gain. I’d been to an audiologist in the past and know that my hearing is worse on the left side. I don’t need Sennheiser to remind me of that!

After using it for a couple of hours, I wanted to tweak some of the settings to make certain situations easier to deal with. Unfortunately, the app required me to set up the hearing aids again from scratch in order to ‘Update’ the settings. I had to write down what the settings were initially so I could have a reference point from which to work. It certainly would have been simpler to be able to tweak the settings directly instead of having to remember or write it down.

Appearance:
It was pointed out to me that the black backing to the ear buds was very visible in my ears, along with the wire heading to the ear bud from the outside portion. While hearing loss is not something to be embarrassed about, I’m not keen on how clearly this pair highlights itself to showcase that I’m wearing something. While I was out and about, I did hear someone say they through I was wearing ear buds, which was odd for someone my age.

Usage (TV / Computer / Phone):
After a couple of attempts, I was able to connect the hearing aids to my computer. At first, it did not appear in the list of bluetooth devices. After putting the hearing aids back in the case, then taking them out again, they conencted. Once connected, the sound quality was decent and clear from the PC. I also tried to connect the ‘TV mode’ on the hearing aid to my TV. I have an external bluetooth adapter for the TV, which is driven from the optical audio out. I’ve used this witth a personal surround speaker from Sony (great product) and which had been a godsend for allowing me to raise the volume for myself without disburbing those around me. I was hoping the adapter would connect to the hearing aids, but it did not. 

Connecting to phone audio was easier in some ways. I was able to get music playing through the hearing aids and they sounded as good as the computer with decent frequency range. Howver, when I got a call, I wasn’t able to get that to connect directly. I ended up using the speakerphone on my cell or my caller wasn’t able to hear me.

Usage (Conversation):
Sennhieser has done a decent job of rejecting ambient noise and focusing on a close conversation. It was certainly a big improvement over not using anything (and my shouting to others as I coudn’t hear myself). From talking to others about their experience, however, they’ve noted useful features on their hearing aids such as frequency shift, music pause, and overall clearer hearing.

Overall:
Hearing is a very personal experience. No two people lose their hearing in the same way. A specialist adds value in helping to tune a hearing aid and help you use it most effectively. They will also help you pick the right one for the features you want. While this comes at a price, I think that price is worth it when considering how long and how often hearing aids will get used. Sennheiser has done an admirable job of creating a hearing aid at a value price point. It’s just not the one for me."
118,BestBuy,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,"Good quality , but not clearly remarkable.","Firstly I am a Best Bujy Tech Insider and I did receive these Sennheiser All-Day Clear Slim hearing aids for the putpose of review.

I am a long time hearing aid user, so I
have experience with hearing aids of which all have deficiencies and these Sennheiser All-Day Clear Slims are no excreption.

I like the build quality. The heavy bendable wire is a good asset as it helps keep the hearing aid on your ear in the case of the ear insert comming out. I like the app, it installed easily and quides you in the setup of the hearing aids. the volume of each side can be individually controlled or they can be merged as one. There is an audio equalizer, but it has limited adjustments. It comes with three sizes  of ear inserts.

The battery life is all day if you only use them as hearing aids, If you use it for streaming audio from a phone, tablet or laptop, battery life will be rather limited. The charging case does not have a battery for charging so it will have to be plugged in for charging.It comes with a decent user manual and extra wax guards and the tool to replace them. 

What needs to be made clear is that although they are Blue Tooth, you can't connect them to your TV without buying a rather expensive adapter that then connects with the Sennheiser All-Day Slim hearing aids, and that is a real bummer if you were hoping  to be able to stream audio in private from your TV.

What I thought that stood out as a plus was that it didn't seem to exagerate wind noise, creaks and rattles in my older car as my other aids do. While watching TV they seem to not exagerate surrounding  sounds, such as ceiling fans.

They do a decent job streaming audio, but not great unless you hold your fingers over the ear inserts, then they sound like good ear phones. So unless you want to do that or put ear muffs over them, the sound will be a little hollow. It has separate settings for streaming and listening, which they call ""live Music"".

Reviewing hearing aids is not scientific, as they will react differently for each individual. Also you have to give your brain time to learn to process what it receives and turn it into what will eventually sound normal for you.

As hearing aids go and considering what they cost,it is a toss up as to whether I would reccomend them to a friend without reviewing other hearing aids. You can buy a service package that allows you to take they to a hearing aid center or store for adjustment or repair. You can find the cost of that on Sennheiser's website.

I am sorry that I can't be all Rah Rah, or No Way, about these hearing aids, because until I have used them for an extended period, I can not make a certain yay or nay vote on these."
10,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Mrs,Takes some getting used to. Does magnify sounds. Never had hearing aids before so not sure of what to expect.
10,BestBuy,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Poor material and performance,Very cheap quality. Too much noise and the material is very cheap. Broke within 1 week and brand refused to repair for free. Will never suggest anyone.
10,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,comfortable and work great,"Hearing aids without a doctor; sounds interesting. I have a tad bit of hearing loss but not enough to try and get hearing aids in all reality.  So, these are fun to try out and see how much they help.   I love the setup of these buds, everything is through the app.  You take them out stick the battery in, open the app and it walks you through setting them up.  When I first opened the container I was a little overwhelmed with all the little tubs but I quickly realized those are just to give everyone some customizability and all those are really needed once you find the one that fits you.  I got the Bluetooth all setup and it gave me a hearing test and then customized the sound to my ear test results.  There are different modes to try out and I immediately noticed the difference when in a noisy environment, these allow me to pick out conversations way more easily That has been a really nice feature of using these.  The other place I really noticed that these helped was in the car, I can easily hear my kid talk to me from the back seat which was really convenient.  There are two things that I don’t like; one is that they don’t have rechargeable batteries. Rechargeable batteries are just so much more convenient and save money over time.  The other thing that I don’t like is that Bluetooth is built in but not Bluetooth capabilities for phone calls.  I use Bluetooth headsets to hear my conference calls better and that both aren’t compatible my ears at the same time, which I find annoying.
It's the holidays and I’m with my wife’s family; my father-in-law has wanted to try hearing aids but hasn’t gone through the trouble going to the doctor, with this it was really easy to have him try them out, I just redid the hearing test and he was super happy being able to hear all of the sudden.  Overall, I love that someone can just get these now and configure them in a quiet area and be good to go.  I think that Bluetooth phone call integration should be included, and I would much rather have rechargeable batteries but if hearing and ease of set up is your first priority these are awesome."
10,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"Lightweight, Comfortable, and High Quality Sound","The Lexie Lumen hearing aids fit well.  They are small and lightweight.  Wearing them all day didn’t cause me to have to adjust them throughout the day.  I don’t notice that they are in.  That’s saying a lot since I wear glasses.  I didn’t run into any problems over a period of 7 full days wearing the hearing aids with my glasses.  If you are worried about the ear pieces of your glasses causing problems with them, don’t worry as I didn’t have any issues.  I also had multiple conference calls while wearing them.  My headset on with the hearing aids in wasn’t uncomfortable and I was in one-to-two-hour calls without a problem.  You get multiple sets of tubes and multiple sets of tips, so you shouldn’t have any problems finding the combination that works best for you.

Battery

The hearing aids use size 312 batteries.  They come with 24 batteries.  So far, the battery in each of them are still running.  With Bluetooth built-in to them, and that being on, didn’t cause a drain on the batteries.  7am to 11pm for 7 days and I’m still running on the original batteries.  The one thing I would like to see changed is the way you power off the hearing aids.  In order to power them off, you open the battery tray.  I would be nice to have a switch to turn them off.  The problem I ran into with this is that when I pick them up in the mornings, one of the batteries would fall out of the tray.  Not that big of a deal, but as the size 312 batteries are small, I found myself hunting for a dropped battery.

Sound quality

Sound quality is nothing short of amazing.  These are so much better than my previous hearing aids.  I still have the ones I was previously using from a different manufacturer, but I will not be going back to those and will only use these now.  It took me two days to get used to these, but Lexie says to give it two weeks.  After two days, I didn’t notice the electronic enhanced sound as being that.  With my previous hearing aids, it was always noticeable, but not with the Lexie hearing aids.

App/features

Lexie has an app that you use to run a sound test so the app can setup an audio profile for you that works best for your hearing loss.  It took only a few minutes to get through the test.  Once that is done, you can adjust the volume and set different profiles based on your environment.  Currently there are six profiles.  The profiles can be selected with the push of a button on the hearing aids if you need to change profiles but don’t want to do it through your mobile device.  The app will also show you a power indicator for each hearing aid as well as get remote expert support.

I’m pleased with what Lexie has here.  I’ve tried several brands in the past and the Lexie hearing aids, by far, exceed all of the hearing aids that I’ve tried over the years.  I don’t think anyone will go wrong with these.  I can’t recommend them enough.  Well done Lexie!"
10,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Great Tech. The App Makes Them Easy To Setup,"Great Tech in these and the App makes getting them fine-tuned a breeze.  These use standard zinc-air hearing aid batteries, if somebody already has a traditional (before over the counter OTC options became available) they are already use to these types of batteries.  The batteries last about 5 to 8 days as long as you crack open the battery holder when they are not in use.  My wife had no problems installing the Lexie app and getting these setup with the easy to use hearing setup session.  The 2nd morning, the app was not responsive, and upon restarting it, it would not get past the ""programming hearing aids"" step.  Called the number that came up on the App under HELP, and had a live person helping us in literally less than a minute.  They were super helpful running through things to try in order, we had to delete the data on the app and redo the hearing setup session from scratch, but they have worked flawlessly since then.  The sound help from these after setup is exceptional.  The detail that can be picked up by those with hearing loss will vary, but my wife has reported that the everyday mode helps a lot, but the noisy indoors mode makes a big difference when music, multiple voices, sounds of multiple people moving and doing things in the kitchen.  They can hear me clearly around corners now without me raising my voice, and they were able to track me by sound all around the top floor of our house.  Just the little things like they were able to hear the raindrops hitting super clearly when the front door was opened while being all the way across the living room.  The app makes using these super easy, so you don't have to fiddle with the controls on the hearing aids themselves.  Select sound modes, adjust volume levels, check your hearing profile.  I wholeheartedly suggest these for those trying the new Over the Counter (OTC) approach to hearing aids."
10,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,A Great Pair Of Hearing Aids!,"When I first received the Lexie Lumen OTC hearing aids, I could not get them to pair with the Lexie Application. I received a second set after calling Lexie's customer service department and these paired right out of the box with no issues.

The Lexie hearing aids, powered by Bose, sit snugly behind your ears and connect to your inner ears via a clear plastic cable that is almost invisible. The hearing aid bodies are hardly seen due to their small footprint and high mounting abehind your ears. The color of the Lexie hearing aides I have is gray and blend in with my hair color nicely. The in-ear cords can hardly be seen, are quite small and go into your ear and out of sight.

The Lexie App was easy to download and install on my iPhone. The application allows you to control the volume and sound quality (treble and bass) and is very well thought out. Settings include adjusting between treble and bass, sound balance between ears, sound directionality - front only or from everywhere - and environments - noisy indoor, outdoors, music and everyday.

The Lexie Lumen OTC B-1 Hearing Aids powered by Bose are a very good investment and work very well in helping you hear in most any environment."
10,BestBuy,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,There are better choices out there,"The first thing you may notice about the Lexi Lumen, particularly if they aren't your first hearing aids, is that they are relatively large. They are larger than my previous professional model, and significantly larger than my current professional aid, both of which are over-the-ear types like the Lumen. Still, they are very lightweight and comfortable, so it really depends on how noticeable they are on you and whether having a visible hearing aid bothers you. They run off of a standard hearing aid battery size 312. These last about a week, and the Lumen comes packaged with several packs of batteries. 

Fitting the hearing aid involves using a cardboard sizer to select the correct length of tubing and then choosing the earpiece that works the best for you. A wide selection of both is included in the package. Setup then continues through the app.

I have hearing loss in one ear (unilateral). The Lexi app correctly identified that anyone with unilateral hearing loss should be examined by a physician to see if there is an underlying issue that needs to be addressed, which not all OTC tests do. Like other OTC hearing aids, the Lexi app administers a hearing test. While selecting a quiet environment is critical, the Lexi app does not tell you if your current environment is quiet enough. Unlike the other apps I have tried, sequential tests conducted in the same quiet environment showed significantly different hearing profiles. Sometimes it showed me having diminished mid-range hearing, but normal high and low end, which is exactly the opposite of what a professional test and tests from Jabra and Sony OTC aids showed. Once it showed me with completely normal hearing in both ears. It usually showed me with relatively normal high-end hearing, which I can guarantee is not correct. The app stores your most recent profiles and you can revert to any one of them, including selecting a different profile for each ear. This is handy, but would be even handier if it showed you what the profile looked like rather than just the date and time it was created.

Once you’ve set up the Lumen, you can select from six different environment modes, including using a companion mic or a telecoil. “Music” was actually the most natural sound for me, but it also amplified a lot of background noises that natural hearing (and other hearing aids I've used) don't amplify. I ended up setting them on “Everyday” to block the background noise, accepting some reduced naturalness to the sound.

As far as sound clarity, the Lexi Lumen was quite good, but for me it had a rather unusual glitch that I still haven’t been able to resolve, even with help from Lexi’s support line. When a sudden noise occurs (think of a book opening, a microwave oven alarm, or a knock at the door) the Lumen initially mutes the sound before bringing it up to a normal volume. While only about half a second, it is very distracting. Since I only wear one hearing aid, sounds initially appeared to be coming from the unaided side until the Lexi caught up. Changing the environment to “Music” improved this, but this mode amplifies a lot of frequencies that could best be described as background static - perfect for picking up the nuances in music, not so good for walking around. I have been working with Lexi support to find out why this is happening, but so far we have no resolution. The support team’s approach is to have you try a different setting / earpiece and live with it a few days, at which point they’ll call you back. Well, actually, you end up having to call them back, as I have yet to have them actually make the promised follow-on call. If we get this issue corrected, it would significantly change my impression of these. I will post an updated review should that happen.

If you have hearing loss, any hearing aid will change your life, and in that respect the Lexi Lumen may deliver what you need. Overall, though, there are better choices out there."
10,BestBuy,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,very comfortable,"So far, I have been enjoying these hearing aids.  But I have noticed a few things and why I am giving them a 3-star rating.  I have pretty bad hearing loss in my left ear and right ear.  Left ear more so.  I can tell these are on in the right ear easy as I get static when I adjust or touch the right hearing aid.  My left ear though, I don't get that static and I only can tell it's on because in the app I can have it beep in whatever hearing aid.  I also feel like the left ear is much lower sounding.  I am assuming this is due to having worse hearing loss in my left ear and so its maxed out.  Sad if this is the case as I have used others that seem to get louder.  I also noticed that on my right ear, if I adjust the volume past 6 or so, it starts to get static/distorted.  Same when you might turn on an audio device and turn it up too loud for what the speakers can handle.  

The app, to set up, it has you go thru a hearing test.  This is normal and I don't mind that.  However, instead of short beeps, it would just do a single long beep.  I prefer the short beeps.  Would be nice to have that as an option.  It would also be nice if you could input your own hearing loss diagram.  Or customize it.  

Batteries, why now a days they did not go with rechargeables I don't know.  Would be nice if they could have made it so you could place in the case and have the case charge.  That said, these do last about a week of normal wear.  That brings up another issue, to turn these off, you have to open the battery compartment.  I would have liked to see this future in the app so that I could turn off easily while keeping in my ear.  there are times I want to briefly turn off but don't want to have to take them out.  

These are also partial Bluetooth from what you might expect when you hear they are Bluetooth.  That being that they connect to your phone via Bluetooth.  However, you can't listen to music, videos etc.  you can only control them via the app.  

Now for comfort.  This is one reason why I am giving this a 3 star instead of a 2.  These are my favorite hearing aid style.  I like that they go behind the ear and then a tube inside the ear canal.  I have used these all day and not have them fall out.  My left ear were earbuds usually sit at has a lump.  So, it causes most hearing buds to fall out as they don't go in as far because of this.  With these, because they don't rely on sitting in the ear, I had no issues with them coming out.  I also in a way like this style because it lets everyone around me know that I do have a hearing loss.  This isn't something to be ashamed of.  This also seems too not have anyone question if I have ear buds in.  

Like I mentioned, with these I would have liked to see rechargeable batteries, and a way for them to be able to allow you to listen to your device at the same time.  And better speaker for them for those with more severe hearing loss.  They have a Bose one that is a little more expensive, but I believe those are like I mentioned above, that sit in your ear.  I like this style (or ones that are straight that just go into the ear canal)."
10,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Great Choice If You Have Need,"Lexie Hearing - Lexie Lumen OTC Hearing Aids: An excellent choice if you need them.

So my dad is living with us for a year or so after losing my mom unexpectedly. The wife and I {along with my brother and other family members) have noted for YEARS that his hearing has been getting progressively worse. After living with us for as long as he had, it was blatantly obvious to EVERYONE that his hearing was rapidly depleteing.

Unfortunately, he continually denied it. Even though both of his brothers and 2 of 3 of nephews have worn hearing aids for years, he simply denied it.

Well, we finally had the difficult conversation and he agreed that we were probably right... When I gave him the chance to look over these and read the Best Buy tech spec's he agreed to try them out. I can tell you, he is glad he did!

He is much more connected in coversations, more aware of things happening around him AND he has turned the TV volume down significantly.

After downloading the app, set up was pretty easy. We had him going in a fairly short time. The app was easy to use and laid out very well. As for comfort, he has worn them for hours at a time and had no complaints, at least after a couple days to ""burn them in"". He has used them in multipe social settings, while driving, at a Colorado Avalanche game, skiing. All with no problems.

These are a high-end medical device and I would whole-heartedly reccomend them to a friend!"
10,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Affordable Option For Average Hearing Problems,"BOX:   In the box you will get the hearing aids in a case, extra batteries, a user manual, quick start guide, alternate tubes, different sized tips, measuring tool, drying capsules, cleaning wire and a tool to clean your hearing aids.  These come in a nice, compact, convenient case, kind of like what you would keep ear buds in.

ASSEMBLY:   I was able to put the batteries in (at the bottom of each hearing aid), chose my tube length for around the ear and get these set up pretty quickly.   It is simple to change the tube length after using the measuring tool.  They unplug and plug in with ease.  The tubes are even labeled left and right to make it easy for you.

CONTROLS:   The hearing aids themselves have buttons to help control your hearing.  Each hearing aid has these buttons.  The top button is a program button, which helps change the settings for regular and background programs, along with 2 other options.  There is also volume up and down.

LEXIE APP & SETUP:   If you find, like I do, that the buttons are not easy to control, these hearing aids are designed to work with the Lexie App.  The aids are connected to your phone via Bluetooth.  Just because these are connected to your phone through Bluetooth does not mean you can stream music with them.  They weren’t designed for that.  The app walks you through the set up process by answering some questions and even does a hearing check to help with the programming to help you hear better.

PERSONAL RESULTS:  I have found that I can hear much better while watching television at a lower volume, which my family loves.  I can now hear conversations while in a crowded environment, such as parties, restaurants, etc. This was one of my biggest obstacles.  I was nodding my head (because my mouth reading wasn’t always accurate) and I have had some pretty embarrassing moments.  So glad that won’t be happening again, since I can hear so much better in 
these types of environment.  

SUPPORT:   If you have questions, the support team is excellent in helping you to get these working right for you.

For the price of these, you are getting updated hearing aids for less than getting them through a doctor.  If you are on a budget and can’t get hearing aids through your insurance, these are a reasonably priced option."
10,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Great alternative to prescription hearing aids!,"I got these as a gift for my father-in-law who has tried both in-ear, and over-the-ear hearing aids.  Overall, he likes them, and they are comfortable.

They have replaceable batteries which is a plus as you don't have to recharge them on a daily basis. So far, battery life is good and additional batteries are included. Batteries are also available at just about every retailer and online.

The retention wire does a good job of keeping the hearing aids in place. The volume control works well and the environment control button does a good job with background noise.

Unfortunately, there's no on/off switch so you have to remove the batteries to turn them off. Although this preserves battery life, the downside is the hole for the batteries is very small. An older person and/or someone with unsteady hands might have a difficult time replacing the batteries.

The app was easy to install and the hearing test allows you to tailor the aids for your specific needs.

Unfortunately, they are little bit large and noticeable so if you're someone who is self-conscious about hearing aids, the in-ear type might be preferable.

However, the biggest advantage to these is the price! No need to spend thousands of dollars or take multiple trips to the audiologist for custom hearing aids.  

These do a great job and get five stars for sure!"
10,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Great affordable OTC hearing aids!,"These hearing aids are very nice compared to the much higher priced aids. They have a 45 day money-back guarantee. You don't need an appointment to get them as they are FDA-regulated. They have replaceable batteries. They are sweatproof and have noise reduction and feedback cancellation. There is an app where the user can have more control including the adjustable volume.  You are able to use FSA and HSA dollars to pay. Out of the box they are very easy to fit and use. The app has a hearing check so it can be setup just for your hearing. What I liked is the hearing aids have directional hearing so you know where the sound is coming from. Some aids don't have that and you have to try and figure out where the sound came from. The lexie has a subscription where if you pay the monthly cost you get a care kit that will send you batteries as well as accessories. What was also nice about the app is you can choose what hearing environment you are in. It has every day use, noisy indoor, music, outdoor, telecoil or companion mic.

Again I will keep my eye open on this company as they Address these issues I am sure that they will make an application that is easy for seniors to use to control the hearing aid and that less interaction with Small buttons and replacement parts will be made.

I strongly think they should probably ask Bose for their noise cancelation technology an earbud design which is more user friendly and adds a feature that helps greatly with senior hearing

But that would best be a good suggestion that probably will not happen"
10,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Works well with iPhone,Very happy with my purchase of Lexie Lumen. I got the light grey model which looks great and is very discrete. Setting up from my iPhone was easy and it works well with different environment settings. This works better and is more comfortable than my last hearing aid that cost me over $2500.
10,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Hearing aids half the size and fraction of cost,"Hearing aids have come a long way size, technology, and affordability wise. Compared to  similar hearing aids that my grandmother has used, these Lexie Lumen OTC hearing aids are almost half the size of normal hearing aids, a fraction of the cost, and easy to setup and use with bluetooth technology and the use of their app to go through the process and take the hearing check to really have these work best for your specific hearing deficits. With sizing and going through setup you're up and running. 

The buttons are small enough to not be bulky but at the same time raised enough to function easily at the touch of your finger.  There Adaptive Noise Reduction helps to differentiate between 
sounds which are more speech-like or more noise-like. They include multiple tip sizes so you're set for pretty much any size ear whether it small, medium, or large. It comes with a nice carrying case as well.

I have recently had issues with fluid build up in my ear and slightly diminished hearing. I've been having to pop my ears to get the sound back.  My ENT doctor has said I may need a procedure to fix this but in the mean time these have definitely been a blessing in disguise. It can be extremely frustrating when you're asking someone to repeat what they've said or you aren't able to comprehend due to mild hearing loss. I would definitely recommend these to others"
10,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Tears of happiness,"For some context on the user, I had my 80 year old grandmother use these hearing aids because whenever any of us in the family talk to her, she says that we are mumbling and she can't understand what we're saying, blaming us as the reason for her not being able to hear us well.

My grandmother and my grandfather always have the television volume up to near the max that whenever we visit their house it's hard to hear and we need to lower the volume.

After gifting these to my grandmother (I wish I had a second pair for my grandfather), there was no noticeable difference immediately which is normal. In addition she didn't want to believe that her hearing was the issue.

After about a week, it seemed so subtle, but it was great news in a funny way. She said we're now too loud! Which we were happy to hear. She can definitely hear much better.

Wanted to share this review in a story-like format of how it has helped our family grow closer. Simply put, they work. Give them a shot. It's worth it."

Still struggle with noisy situations, but don't know if that is the hearing aids or my own hearing loss issues."

10,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,comfortable and work great,"Hearing aids without a doctor; sounds interesting. I have a tad bit of hearing loss but not enough to try and get hearing aids in all reality.  So, these are fun to try out and see how much they help.   I love the setup of these buds, everything is through the app.  You take them out stick the battery in, open the app and it walks you through setting them up.  When I first opened the container I was a little overwhelmed with all the little tubs but I quickly realized those are just to give everyone some customizability and all those are really needed once you find the one that fits you.  I got the Bluetooth all setup and it gave me a hearing test and then customized the sound to my ear test results.  There are different modes to try out and I immediately noticed the difference when in a noisy environment, these allow me to pick out conversations way more easily That has been a really nice feature of using these.  The other place I really noticed that these helped was in the car, I can easily hear my kid talk to me from the back seat which was really convenient.  There are two things that I don’t like; one is that they don’t have rechargeable batteries. Rechargeable batteries are just so much more convenient and save money over time.  The other thing that I don’t like is that Bluetooth is built in but not Bluetooth capabilities for phone calls.  I use Bluetooth headsets to hear my conference calls better and that both aren’t compatible my ears at the same time, which I find annoying.
It's the holidays and I’m with my wife’s family; my father-in-law has wanted to try hearing aids but hasn’t gone through the trouble going to the doctor, with this it was really easy to have him try them out, I just redid the hearing test and he was super happy being able to hear all of the sudden.  Overall, I love that someone can just get these now and configure them in a quiet area and be good to go.  I think that Bluetooth phone call integration should be included, and I would much rather have rechargeable batteries but if hearing and ease of set up is your first priority these are awesome."
10,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"Lightweight, Comfortable, and High Quality Sound","The Lexie Lumen hearing aids fit well.  They are small and lightweight.  Wearing them all day didn’t cause me to have to adjust them throughout the day.  I don’t notice that they are in.  That’s saying a lot since I wear glasses.  I didn’t run into any problems over a period of 7 full days wearing the hearing aids with my glasses.  If you are worried about the ear pieces of your glasses causing problems with them, don’t worry as I didn’t have any issues.  I also had multiple conference calls while wearing them.  My headset on with the hearing aids in wasn’t uncomfortable and I was in one-to-two-hour calls without a problem.  You get multiple sets of tubes and multiple sets of tips, so you shouldn’t have any problems finding the combination that works best for you.

Battery

The hearing aids use size 312 batteries.  They come with 24 batteries.  So far, the battery in each of them are still running.  With Bluetooth built-in to them, and that being on, didn’t cause a drain on the batteries.  7am to 11pm for 7 days and I’m still running on the original batteries.  The one thing I would like to see changed is the way you power off the hearing aids.  In order to power them off, you open the battery tray.  I would be nice to have a switch to turn them off.  The problem I ran into with this is that when I pick them up in the mornings, one of the batteries would fall out of the tray.  Not that big of a deal, but as the size 312 batteries are small, I found myself hunting for a dropped battery.

Sound quality

Sound quality is nothing short of amazing.  These are so much better than my previous hearing aids.  I still have the ones I was previously using from a different manufacturer, but I will not be going back to those and will only use these now.  It took me two days to get used to these, but Lexie says to give it two weeks.  After two days, I didn’t notice the electronic enhanced sound as being that.  With my previous hearing aids, it was always noticeable, but not with the Lexie hearing aids.

App/features

Lexie has an app that you use to run a sound test so the app can setup an audio profile for you that works best for your hearing loss.  It took only a few minutes to get through the test.  Once that is done, you can adjust the volume and set different profiles based on your environment.  Currently there are six profiles.  The profiles can be selected with the push of a button on the hearing aids if you need to change profiles but don’t want to do it through your mobile device.  The app will also show you a power indicator for each hearing aid as well as get remote expert support.

I’m pleased with what Lexie has here.  I’ve tried several brands in the past and the Lexie hearing aids, by far, exceed all of the hearing aids that I’ve tried over the years.  I don’t think anyone will go wrong with these.  I can’t recommend them enough.  Well done Lexie!"
10,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Great Tech. The App Makes Them Easy To Setup,"Great Tech in these and the App makes getting them fine-tuned a breeze.  These use standard zinc-air hearing aid batteries, if somebody already has a traditional (before over the counter OTC options became available) they are already use to these types of batteries.  The batteries last about 5 to 8 days as long as you crack open the battery holder when they are not in use.  My wife had no problems installing the Lexie app and getting these setup with the easy to use hearing setup session.  The 2nd morning, the app was not responsive, and upon restarting it, it would not get past the ""programming hearing aids"" step.  Called the number that came up on the App under HELP, and had a live person helping us in literally less than a minute.  They were super helpful running through things to try in order, we had to delete the data on the app and redo the hearing setup session from scratch, but they have worked flawlessly since then.  The sound help from these after setup is exceptional.  The detail that can be picked up by those with hearing loss will vary, but my wife has reported that the everyday mode helps a lot, but the noisy indoors mode makes a big difference when music, multiple voices, sounds of multiple people moving and doing things in the kitchen.  They can hear me clearly around corners now without me raising my voice, and they were able to track me by sound all around the top floor of our house.  Just the little things like they were able to hear the raindrops hitting super clearly when the front door was opened while being all the way across the living room.  The app makes using these super easy, so you don't have to fiddle with the controls on the hearing aids themselves.  Select sound modes, adjust volume levels, check your hearing profile.  I wholeheartedly suggest these for those trying the new Over the Counter (OTC) approach to hearing aids."
10,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,A Great Pair Of Hearing Aids!,"When I first received the Lexie Lumen OTC hearing aids, I could not get them to pair with the Lexie Application. I received a second set after calling Lexie's customer service department and these paired right out of the box with no issues.

The Lexie hearing aids, powered by Bose, sit snugly behind your ears and connect to your inner ears via a clear plastic cable that is almost invisible. The hearing aid bodies are hardly seen due to their small footprint and high mounting abehind your ears. The color of the Lexie hearing aides I have is gray and blend in with my hair color nicely. The in-ear cords can hardly be seen, are quite small and go into your ear and out of sight.

The Lexie App was easy to download and install on my iPhone. The application allows you to control the volume and sound quality (treble and bass) and is very well thought out. Settings include adjusting between treble and bass, sound balance between ears, sound directionality - front only or from everywhere - and environments - noisy indoor, outdoors, music and everyday.

The Lexie Lumen OTC B-1 Hearing Aids powered by Bose are a very good investment and work very well in helping you hear in most any environment."
10,BestBuy,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,There are better choices out there,"The first thing you may notice about the Lexi Lumen, particularly if they aren't your first hearing aids, is that they are relatively large. They are larger than my previous professional model, and significantly larger than my current professional aid, both of which are over-the-ear types like the Lumen. Still, they are very lightweight and comfortable, so it really depends on how noticeable they are on you and whether having a visible hearing aid bothers you. They run off of a standard hearing aid battery size 312. These last about a week, and the Lumen comes packaged with several packs of batteries. 

Fitting the hearing aid involves using a cardboard sizer to select the correct length of tubing and then choosing the earpiece that works the best for you. A wide selection of both is included in the package. Setup then continues through the app.

I have hearing loss in one ear (unilateral). The Lexi app correctly identified that anyone with unilateral hearing loss should be examined by a physician to see if there is an underlying issue that needs to be addressed, which not all OTC tests do. Like other OTC hearing aids, the Lexi app administers a hearing test. While selecting a quiet environment is critical, the Lexi app does not tell you if your current environment is quiet enough. Unlike the other apps I have tried, sequential tests conducted in the same quiet environment showed significantly different hearing profiles. Sometimes it showed me having diminished mid-range hearing, but normal high and low end, which is exactly the opposite of what a professional test and tests from Jabra and Sony OTC aids showed. Once it showed me with completely normal hearing in both ears. It usually showed me with relatively normal high-end hearing, which I can guarantee is not correct. The app stores your most recent profiles and you can revert to any one of them, including selecting a different profile for each ear. This is handy, but would be even handier if it showed you what the profile looked like rather than just the date and time it was created.

Once you’ve set up the Lumen, you can select from six different environment modes, including using a companion mic or a telecoil. “Music” was actually the most natural sound for me, but it also amplified a lot of background noises that natural hearing (and other hearing aids I've used) don't amplify. I ended up setting them on “Everyday” to block the background noise, accepting some reduced naturalness to the sound.

As far as sound clarity, the Lexi Lumen was quite good, but for me it had a rather unusual glitch that I still haven’t been able to resolve, even with help from Lexi’s support line. When a sudden noise occurs (think of a book opening, a microwave oven alarm, or a knock at the door) the Lumen initially mutes the sound before bringing it up to a normal volume. While only about half a second, it is very distracting. Since I only wear one hearing aid, sounds initially appeared to be coming from the unaided side until the Lexi caught up. Changing the environment to “Music” improved this, but this mode amplifies a lot of frequencies that could best be described as background static - perfect for picking up the nuances in music, not so good for walking around. I have been working with Lexi support to find out why this is happening, but so far we have no resolution. The support team’s approach is to have you try a different setting / earpiece and live with it a few days, at which point they’ll call you back. Well, actually, you end up having to call them back, as I have yet to have them actually make the promised follow-on call. If we get this issue corrected, it would significantly change my impression of these. I will post an updated review should that happen.

If you have hearing loss, any hearing aid will change your life, and in that respect the Lexi Lumen may deliver what you need. Overall, though, there are better choices out there."
10,BestBuy,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,very comfortable,"So far, I have been enjoying these hearing aids.  But I have noticed a few things and why I am giving them a 3-star rating.  I have pretty bad hearing loss in my left ear and right ear.  Left ear more so.  I can tell these are on in the right ear easy as I get static when I adjust or touch the right hearing aid.  My left ear though, I don't get that static and I only can tell it's on because in the app I can have it beep in whatever hearing aid.  I also feel like the left ear is much lower sounding.  I am assuming this is due to having worse hearing loss in my left ear and so its maxed out.  Sad if this is the case as I have used others that seem to get louder.  I also noticed that on my right ear, if I adjust the volume past 6 or so, it starts to get static/distorted.  Same when you might turn on an audio device and turn it up too loud for what the speakers can handle.  

The app, to set up, it has you go thru a hearing test.  This is normal and I don't mind that.  However, instead of short beeps, it would just do a single long beep.  I prefer the short beeps.  Would be nice to have that as an option.  It would also be nice if you could input your own hearing loss diagram.  Or customize it.  

Batteries, why now a days they did not go with rechargeables I don't know.  Would be nice if they could have made it so you could place in the case and have the case charge.  That said, these do last about a week of normal wear.  That brings up another issue, to turn these off, you have to open the battery compartment.  I would have liked to see this future in the app so that I could turn off easily while keeping in my ear.  there are times I want to briefly turn off but don't want to have to take them out.  

These are also partial Bluetooth from what you might expect when you hear they are Bluetooth.  That being that they connect to your phone via Bluetooth.  However, you can't listen to music, videos etc.  you can only control them via the app.  

Now for comfort.  This is one reason why I am giving this a 3 star instead of a 2.  These are my favorite hearing aid style.  I like that they go behind the ear and then a tube inside the ear canal.  I have used these all day and not have them fall out.  My left ear were earbuds usually sit at has a lump.  So, it causes most hearing buds to fall out as they don't go in as far because of this.  With these, because they don't rely on sitting in the ear, I had no issues with them coming out.  I also in a way like this style because it lets everyone around me know that I do have a hearing loss.  This isn't something to be ashamed of.  This also seems too not have anyone question if I have ear buds in.  

Like I mentioned, with these I would have liked to see rechargeable batteries, and a way for them to be able to allow you to listen to your device at the same time.  And better speaker for them for those with more severe hearing loss.  They have a Bose one that is a little more expensive, but I believe those are like I mentioned above, that sit in your ear.  I like this style (or ones that are straight that just go into the ear canal)."
10,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Great Choice If You Have Need,"Lexie Hearing - Lexie Lumen OTC Hearing Aids: An excellent choice if you need them.

So my dad is living with us for a year or so after losing my mom unexpectedly. The wife and I {along with my brother and other family members) have noted for YEARS that his hearing has been getting progressively worse. After living with us for as long as he had, it was blatantly obvious to EVERYONE that his hearing was rapidly depleteing.

Unfortunately, he continually denied it. Even though both of his brothers and 2 of 3 of nephews have worn hearing aids for years, he simply denied it.

Well, we finally had the difficult conversation and he agreed that we were probably right... When I gave him the chance to look over these and read the Best Buy tech spec's he agreed to try them out. I can tell you, he is glad he did!

He is much more connected in coversations, more aware of things happening around him AND he has turned the TV volume down significantly.

After downloading the app, set up was pretty easy. We had him going in a fairly short time. The app was easy to use and laid out very well. As for comfort, he has worn them for hours at a time and had no complaints, at least after a couple days to ""burn them in"". He has used them in multipe social settings, while driving, at a Colorado Avalanche game, skiing. All with no problems.

These are a high-end medical device and I would whole-heartedly reccomend them to a friend!"
10,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Affordable Option For Average Hearing Problems,"BOX:   In the box you will get the hearing aids in a case, extra batteries, a user manual, quick start guide, alternate tubes, different sized tips, measuring tool, drying capsules, cleaning wire and a tool to clean your hearing aids.  These come in a nice, compact, convenient case, kind of like what you would keep ear buds in.

ASSEMBLY:   I was able to put the batteries in (at the bottom of each hearing aid), chose my tube length for around the ear and get these set up pretty quickly.   It is simple to change the tube length after using the measuring tool.  They unplug and plug in with ease.  The tubes are even labeled left and right to make it easy for you.

CONTROLS:   The hearing aids themselves have buttons to help control your hearing.  Each hearing aid has these buttons.  The top button is a program button, which helps change the settings for regular and background programs, along with 2 other options.  There is also volume up and down.

LEXIE APP & SETUP:   If you find, like I do, that the buttons are not easy to control, these hearing aids are designed to work with the Lexie App.  The aids are connected to your phone via Bluetooth.  Just because these are connected to your phone through Bluetooth does not mean you can stream music with them.  They weren’t designed for that.  The app walks you through the set up process by answering some questions and even does a hearing check to help with the programming to help you hear better.

PERSONAL RESULTS:  I have found that I can hear much better while watching television at a lower volume, which my family loves.  I can now hear conversations while in a crowded environment, such as parties, restaurants, etc. This was one of my biggest obstacles.  I was nodding my head (because my mouth reading wasn’t always accurate) and I have had some pretty embarrassing moments.  So glad that won’t be happening again, since I can hear so much better in 
these types of environment.  

SUPPORT:   If you have questions, the support team is excellent in helping you to get these working right for you.

For the price of these, you are getting updated hearing aids for less than getting them through a doctor.  If you are on a budget and can’t get hearing aids through your insurance, these are a reasonably priced option."
10,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Great alternative to prescription hearing aids!,"I got these as a gift for my father-in-law who has tried both in-ear, and over-the-ear hearing aids.  Overall, he likes them, and they are comfortable.

They have replaceable batteries which is a plus as you don't have to recharge them on a daily basis. So far, battery life is good and additional batteries are included. Batteries are also available at just about every retailer and online.

The retention wire does a good job of keeping the hearing aids in place. The volume control works well and the environment control button does a good job with background noise.

Unfortunately, there's no on/off switch so you have to remove the batteries to turn them off. Although this preserves battery life, the downside is the hole for the batteries is very small. An older person and/or someone with unsteady hands might have a difficult time replacing the batteries.

The app was easy to install and the hearing test allows you to tailor the aids for your specific needs.

Unfortunately, they are little bit large and noticeable so if you're someone who is self-conscious about hearing aids, the in-ear type might be preferable.

However, the biggest advantage to these is the price! No need to spend thousands of dollars or take multiple trips to the audiologist for custom hearing aids.  

These do a great job and get five stars for sure!"
10,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Great affordable OTC hearing aids!,"These hearing aids are very nice compared to the much higher priced aids. They have a 45 day money-back guarantee. You don't need an appointment to get them as they are FDA-regulated. They have replaceable batteries. They are sweatproof and have noise reduction and feedback cancellation. There is an app where the user can have more control including the adjustable volume.  You are able to use FSA and HSA dollars to pay. Out of the box they are very easy to fit and use. The app has a hearing check so it can be setup just for your hearing. What I liked is the hearing aids have directional hearing so you know where the sound is coming from. Some aids don't have that and you have to try and figure out where the sound came from. The lexie has a subscription where if you pay the monthly cost you get a care kit that will send you batteries as well as accessories. What was also nice about the app is you can choose what hearing environment you are in. It has every day use, noisy indoor, music, outdoor, telecoil or companion mic.

It's the holidays and I’m with my wife’s family; my father-in-law has wanted to try hearing aids but hasn’t gone through the trouble going to the doctor, with this it was really easy to have him try them out, I just redid the hearing test and he was super happy being able to hear all of the sudden.  Overall, I love that someone can just get these now and configure them in a quiet area and be good to go.  I think that Bluetooth phone call integration should be included, and I would much rather have rechargeable batteries but if hearing and ease of set up is your first priority these are awesome."
10,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"Lightweight, Comfortable, and High Quality Sound","The Lexie Lumen hearing aids fit well.  They are small and lightweight.  Wearing them all day didn’t cause me to have to adjust them throughout the day.  I don’t notice that they are in.  That’s saying a lot since I wear glasses.  I didn’t run into any problems over a period of 7 full days wearing the hearing aids with my glasses.  If you are worried about the ear pieces of your glasses causing problems with them, don’t worry as I didn’t have any issues.  I also had multiple conference calls while wearing them.  My headset on with the hearing aids in wasn’t uncomfortable and I was in one-to-two-hour calls without a problem.  You get multiple sets of tubes and multiple sets of tips, so you shouldn’t have any problems finding the combination that works best for you.

Battery

The hearing aids use size 312 batteries.  They come with 24 batteries.  So far, the battery in each of them are still running.  With Bluetooth built-in to them, and that being on, didn’t cause a drain on the batteries.  7am to 11pm for 7 days and I’m still running on the original batteries.  The one thing I would like to see changed is the way you power off the hearing aids.  In order to power them off, you open the battery tray.  I would be nice to have a switch to turn them off.  The problem I ran into with this is that when I pick them up in the mornings, one of the batteries would fall out of the tray.  Not that big of a deal, but as the size 312 batteries are small, I found myself hunting for a dropped battery.

Sound quality

Sound quality is nothing short of amazing.  These are so much better than my previous hearing aids.  I still have the ones I was previously using from a different manufacturer, but I will not be going back to those and will only use these now.  It took me two days to get used to these, but Lexie says to give it two weeks.  After two days, I didn’t notice the electronic enhanced sound as being that.  With my previous hearing aids, it was always noticeable, but not with the Lexie hearing aids.

App/features

Lexie has an app that you use to run a sound test so the app can setup an audio profile for you that works best for your hearing loss.  It took only a few minutes to get through the test.  Once that is done, you can adjust the volume and set different profiles based on your environment.  Currently there are six profiles.  The profiles can be selected with the push of a button on the hearing aids if you need to change profiles but don’t want to do it through your mobile device.  The app will also show you a power indicator for each hearing aid as well as get remote expert support.

I’m pleased with what Lexie has here.  I’ve tried several brands in the past and the Lexie hearing aids, by far, exceed all of the hearing aids that I’ve tried over the years.  I don’t think anyone will go wrong with these.  I can’t recommend them enough.  Well done Lexie!"
10,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Great Tech. The App Makes Them Easy To Setup,"Great Tech in these and the App makes getting them fine-tuned a breeze.  These use standard zinc-air hearing aid batteries, if somebody already has a traditional (before over the counter OTC options became available) they are already use to these types of batteries.  The batteries last about 5 to 8 days as long as you crack open the battery holder when they are not in use.  My wife had no problems installing the Lexie app and getting these setup with the easy to use hearing setup session.  The 2nd morning, the app was not responsive, and upon restarting it, it would not get past the ""programming hearing aids"" step.  Called the number that came up on the App under HELP, and had a live person helping us in literally less than a minute.  They were super helpful running through things to try in order, we had to delete the data on the app and redo the hearing setup session from scratch, but they have worked flawlessly since then.  The sound help from these after setup is exceptional.  The detail that can be picked up by those with hearing loss will vary, but my wife has reported that the everyday mode helps a lot, but the noisy indoors mode makes a big difference when music, multiple voices, sounds of multiple people moving and doing things in the kitchen.  They can hear me clearly around corners now without me raising my voice, and they were able to track me by sound all around the top floor of our house.  Just the little things like they were able to hear the raindrops hitting super clearly when the front door was opened while being all the way across the living room.  The app makes using these super easy, so you don't have to fiddle with the controls on the hearing aids themselves.  Select sound modes, adjust volume levels, check your hearing profile.  I wholeheartedly suggest these for those trying the new Over the Counter (OTC) approach to hearing aids."
10,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,A Great Pair Of Hearing Aids!,"When I first received the Lexie Lumen OTC hearing aids, I could not get them to pair with the Lexie Application. I received a second set after calling Lexie's customer service department and these paired right out of the box with no issues.

The Lexie hearing aids, powered by Bose, sit snugly behind your ears and connect to your inner ears via a clear plastic cable that is almost invisible. The hearing aid bodies are hardly seen due to their small footprint and high mounting abehind your ears. The color of the Lexie hearing aides I have is gray and blend in with my hair color nicely. The in-ear cords can hardly be seen, are quite small and go into your ear and out of sight.

The Lexie App was easy to download and install on my iPhone. The application allows you to control the volume and sound quality (treble and bass) and is very well thought out. Settings include adjusting between treble and bass, sound balance between ears, sound directionality - front only or from everywhere - and environments - noisy indoor, outdoors, music and everyday.

The Lexie Lumen OTC B-1 Hearing Aids powered by Bose are a very good investment and work very well in helping you hear in most any environment."
10,BestBuy,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,There are better choices out there,"The first thing you may notice about the Lexi Lumen, particularly if they aren't your first hearing aids, is that they are relatively large. They are larger than my previous professional model, and significantly larger than my current professional aid, both of which are over-the-ear types like the Lumen. Still, they are very lightweight and comfortable, so it really depends on how noticeable they are on you and whether having a visible hearing aid bothers you. They run off of a standard hearing aid battery size 312. These last about a week, and the Lumen comes packaged with several packs of batteries. 

Fitting the hearing aid involves using a cardboard sizer to select the correct length of tubing and then choosing the earpiece that works the best for you. A wide selection of both is included in the package. Setup then continues through the app.

I have hearing loss in one ear (unilateral). The Lexi app correctly identified that anyone with unilateral hearing loss should be examined by a physician to see if there is an underlying issue that needs to be addressed, which not all OTC tests do. Like other OTC hearing aids, the Lexi app administers a hearing test. While selecting a quiet environment is critical, the Lexi app does not tell you if your current environment is quiet enough. Unlike the other apps I have tried, sequential tests conducted in the same quiet environment showed significantly different hearing profiles. Sometimes it showed me having diminished mid-range hearing, but normal high and low end, which is exactly the opposite of what a professional test and tests from Jabra and Sony OTC aids showed. Once it showed me with completely normal hearing in both ears. It usually showed me with relatively normal high-end hearing, which I can guarantee is not correct. The app stores your most recent profiles and you can revert to any one of them, including selecting a different profile for each ear. This is handy, but would be even handier if it showed you what the profile looked like rather than just the date and time it was created.

Once you’ve set up the Lumen, you can select from six different environment modes, including using a companion mic or a telecoil. “Music” was actually the most natural sound for me, but it also amplified a lot of background noises that natural hearing (and other hearing aids I've used) don't amplify. I ended up setting them on “Everyday” to block the background noise, accepting some reduced naturalness to the sound.

As far as sound clarity, the Lexi Lumen was quite good, but for me it had a rather unusual glitch that I still haven’t been able to resolve, even with help from Lexi’s support line. When a sudden noise occurs (think of a book opening, a microwave oven alarm, or a knock at the door) the Lumen initially mutes the sound before bringing it up to a normal volume. While only about half a second, it is very distracting. Since I only wear one hearing aid, sounds initially appeared to be coming from the unaided side until the Lexi caught up. Changing the environment to “Music” improved this, but this mode amplifies a lot of frequencies that could best be described as background static - perfect for picking up the nuances in music, not so good for walking around. I have been working with Lexi support to find out why this is happening, but so far we have no resolution. The support team’s approach is to have you try a different setting / earpiece and live with it a few days, at which point they’ll call you back. Well, actually, you end up having to call them back, as I have yet to have them actually make the promised follow-on call. If we get this issue corrected, it would significantly change my impression of these. I will post an updated review should that happen.

If you have hearing loss, any hearing aid will change your life, and in that respect the Lexi Lumen may deliver what you need. Overall, though, there are better choices out there."
10,BestBuy,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,very comfortable,"So far, I have been enjoying these hearing aids.  But I have noticed a few things and why I am giving them a 3-star rating.  I have pretty bad hearing loss in my left ear and right ear.  Left ear more so.  I can tell these are on in the right ear easy as I get static when I adjust or touch the right hearing aid.  My left ear though, I don't get that static and I only can tell it's on because in the app I can have it beep in whatever hearing aid.  I also feel like the left ear is much lower sounding.  I am assuming this is due to having worse hearing loss in my left ear and so its maxed out.  Sad if this is the case as I have used others that seem to get louder.  I also noticed that on my right ear, if I adjust the volume past 6 or so, it starts to get static/distorted.  Same when you might turn on an audio device and turn it up too loud for what the speakers can handle.  

The app, to set up, it has you go thru a hearing test.  This is normal and I don't mind that.  However, instead of short beeps, it would just do a single long beep.  I prefer the short beeps.  Would be nice to have that as an option.  It would also be nice if you could input your own hearing loss diagram.  Or customize it.  

Batteries, why now a days they did not go with rechargeables I don't know.  Would be nice if they could have made it so you could place in the case and have the case charge.  That said, these do last about a week of normal wear.  That brings up another issue, to turn these off, you have to open the battery compartment.  I would have liked to see this future in the app so that I could turn off easily while keeping in my ear.  there are times I want to briefly turn off but don't want to have to take them out.  

These are also partial Bluetooth from what you might expect when you hear they are Bluetooth.  That being that they connect to your phone via Bluetooth.  However, you can't listen to music, videos etc.  you can only control them via the app.  

Now for comfort.  This is one reason why I am giving this a 3 star instead of a 2.  These are my favorite hearing aid style.  I like that they go behind the ear and then a tube inside the ear canal.  I have used these all day and not have them fall out.  My left ear were earbuds usually sit at has a lump.  So, it causes most hearing buds to fall out as they don't go in as far because of this.  With these, because they don't rely on sitting in the ear, I had no issues with them coming out.  I also in a way like this style because it lets everyone around me know that I do have a hearing loss.  This isn't something to be ashamed of.  This also seems too not have anyone question if I have ear buds in.  

Like I mentioned, with these I would have liked to see rechargeable batteries, and a way for them to be able to allow you to listen to your device at the same time.  And better speaker for them for those with more severe hearing loss.  They have a Bose one that is a little more expensive, but I believe those are like I mentioned above, that sit in your ear.  I like this style (or ones that are straight that just go into the ear canal)."
10,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Great Choice If You Have Need,"Lexie Hearing - Lexie Lumen OTC Hearing Aids: An excellent choice if you need them.

So my dad is living with us for a year or so after losing my mom unexpectedly. The wife and I {along with my brother and other family members) have noted for YEARS that his hearing has been getting progressively worse. After living with us for as long as he had, it was blatantly obvious to EVERYONE that his hearing was rapidly depleteing.

Unfortunately, he continually denied it. Even though both of his brothers and 2 of 3 of nephews have worn hearing aids for years, he simply denied it.

Well, we finally had the difficult conversation and he agreed that we were probably right... When I gave him the chance to look over these and read the Best Buy tech spec's he agreed to try them out. I can tell you, he is glad he did!

He is much more connected in coversations, more aware of things happening around him AND he has turned the TV volume down significantly.

After downloading the app, set up was pretty easy. We had him going in a fairly short time. The app was easy to use and laid out very well. As for comfort, he has worn them for hours at a time and had no complaints, at least after a couple days to ""burn them in"". He has used them in multipe social settings, while driving, at a Colorado Avalanche game, skiing. All with no problems.

These are a high-end medical device and I would whole-heartedly reccomend them to a friend!"
10,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Affordable Option For Average Hearing Problems,"BOX:   In the box you will get the hearing aids in a case, extra batteries, a user manual, quick start guide, alternate tubes, different sized tips, measuring tool, drying capsules, cleaning wire and a tool to clean your hearing aids.  These come in a nice, compact, convenient case, kind of like what you would keep ear buds in.

ASSEMBLY:   I was able to put the batteries in (at the bottom of each hearing aid), chose my tube length for around the ear and get these set up pretty quickly.   It is simple to change the tube length after using the measuring tool.  They unplug and plug in with ease.  The tubes are even labeled left and right to make it easy for you.

CONTROLS:   The hearing aids themselves have buttons to help control your hearing.  Each hearing aid has these buttons.  The top button is a program button, which helps change the settings for regular and background programs, along with 2 other options.  There is also volume up and down.

LEXIE APP & SETUP:   If you find, like I do, that the buttons are not easy to control, these hearing aids are designed to work with the Lexie App.  The aids are connected to your phone via Bluetooth.  Just because these are connected to your phone through Bluetooth does not mean you can stream music with them.  They weren’t designed for that.  The app walks you through the set up process by answering some questions and even does a hearing check to help with the programming to help you hear better.

PERSONAL RESULTS:  I have found that I can hear much better while watching television at a lower volume, which my family loves.  I can now hear conversations while in a crowded environment, such as parties, restaurants, etc. This was one of my biggest obstacles.  I was nodding my head (because my mouth reading wasn’t always accurate) and I have had some pretty embarrassing moments.  So glad that won’t be happening again, since I can hear so much better in 
these types of environment.  

SUPPORT:   If you have questions, the support team is excellent in helping you to get these working right for you.

For the price of these, you are getting updated hearing aids for less than getting them through a doctor.  If you are on a budget and can’t get hearing aids through your insurance, these are a reasonably priced option."
10,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Great alternative to prescription hearing aids!,"I got these as a gift for my father-in-law who has tried both in-ear, and over-the-ear hearing aids.  Overall, he likes them, and they are comfortable.

They have replaceable batteries which is a plus as you don't have to recharge them on a daily basis. So far, battery life is good and additional batteries are included. Batteries are also available at just about every retailer and online.

The retention wire does a good job of keeping the hearing aids in place. The volume control works well and the environment control button does a good job with background noise.

Unfortunately, there's no on/off switch so you have to remove the batteries to turn them off. Although this preserves battery life, the downside is the hole for the batteries is very small. An older person and/or someone with unsteady hands might have a difficult time replacing the batteries.

The app was easy to install and the hearing test allows you to tailor the aids for your specific needs.

Unfortunately, they are little bit large and noticeable so if you're someone who is self-conscious about hearing aids, the in-ear type might be preferable.

However, the biggest advantage to these is the price! No need to spend thousands of dollars or take multiple trips to the audiologist for custom hearing aids.  

These do a great job and get five stars for sure!"
10,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Great affordable OTC hearing aids!,"These hearing aids are very nice compared to the much higher priced aids. They have a 45 day money-back guarantee. You don't need an appointment to get them as they are FDA-regulated. They have replaceable batteries. They are sweatproof and have noise reduction and feedback cancellation. There is an app where the user can have more control including the adjustable volume.  You are able to use FSA and HSA dollars to pay. Out of the box they are very easy to fit and use. The app has a hearing check so it can be setup just for your hearing. What I liked is the hearing aids have directional hearing so you know where the sound is coming from. Some aids don't have that and you have to try and figure out where the sound came from. The lexie has a subscription where if you pay the monthly cost you get a care kit that will send you batteries as well as accessories. What was also nice about the app is you can choose what hearing environment you are in. It has every day use, noisy indoor, music, outdoor, telecoil or companion mic. If you are looking for a reasonably priced hearing aids these should be on your list."
10,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,"One year check in,  Unit works support outstanding","product is iffy that no seniors like to use it and I don't have a hearing problem I was hoping for a lot more/

Most important feature is customer service,l By all means this company is aggressive and desire satisfaction from its clients which is notable and appreciated.

Because hearing aids are excessively expensive a reasonably intelligent person who has smartphone experience with small buttons and patients can make excellent use of this product

However maintenance and comfort are very questionable, The unit has sticking wire Straps hanging out of the year, Easily perishable Plastic extenders into the ear

And its tiny button control system located on the device is a nuisance for most aged people who also use their smartphones at best for just making phone calls not adjusting features

With its support structure and it's still functionality after a year it has some very good positives.  Support is very important for such devices and they do have a good support team they literally check up on the User's product to lend a hand

Again I will keep my eye open on this company as they Address these issues I am sure that they will make an application that is easy for seniors to use to control the hearing aid and that less interaction with Small buttons and replacement parts will be made.

I strongly think they should probably ask Bose for their noise cancelation technology an earbud design which is more user friendly and adds a feature that helps greatly with senior hearing

But that would best be a good suggestion that probably will not happen"

10,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Hearing aids half the size and fraction of cost,"Hearing aids have come a long way size, technology, and affordability wise. Compared to  similar hearing aids that my grandmother has used, these Lexie Lumen OTC hearing aids are almost half the size of normal hearing aids, a fraction of the cost, and easy to setup and use with bluetooth technology and the use of their app to go through the process and take the hearing check to really have these work best for your specific hearing deficits. With sizing and going through setup you're up and running. 

The buttons are small enough to not be bulky but at the same time raised enough to function easily at the touch of your finger.  There Adaptive Noise Reduction helps to differentiate between 
sounds which are more speech-like or more noise-like. They include multiple tip sizes so you're set for pretty much any size ear whether it small, medium, or large. It comes with a nice carrying case as well.

I have recently had issues with fluid build up in my ear and slightly diminished hearing. I've been having to pop my ears to get the sound back.  My ENT doctor has said I may need a procedure to fix this but in the mean time these have definitely been a blessing in disguise. It can be extremely frustrating when you're asking someone to repeat what they've said or you aren't able to comprehend due to mild hearing loss. I would definitely recommend these to others"
10,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Tears of happiness,"For some context on the user, I had my 80 year old grandmother use these hearing aids because whenever any of us in the family talk to her, she says that we are mumbling and she can't understand what we're saying, blaming us as the reason for her not being able to hear us well.

My grandmother and my grandfather always have the television volume up to near the max that whenever we visit their house it's hard to hear and we need to lower the volume.

After gifting these to my grandmother (I wish I had a second pair for my grandfather), there was no noticeable difference immediately which is normal. In addition she didn't want to believe that her hearing was the issue.

After about a week, it seemed so subtle, but it was great news in a funny way. She said we're now too loud! Which we were happy to hear. She can definitely hear much better.

Wanted to share this review in a story-like format of how it has helped our family grow closer. Simply put, they work. Give them a shot. It's worth it."

There are different modes to try out and I immediately noticed the difference when in a noisy environment, these allow me to pick out conversations way more easily That has been a really nice feature of using these.

The Lexie App was easy to download and install on my iPhone. The application allows you to control the volume and sound quality (treble and bass) and is very well thought out. Settings include adjusting between treble and bass, sound balance between ears, sound directionality - front only or from everywhere - and environments - noisy indoor, outdoors, music and everyday.

The Lexie Lumen OTC B-1 Hearing Aids powered by Bose are a very good investment and work very well in helping you hear in most any environment."
10,BestBuy,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,There are better choices out there,"The first thing you may notice about the Lexi Lumen, particularly if they aren't your first hearing aids, is that they are relatively large. They are larger than my previous professional model, and significantly larger than my current professional aid, both of which are over-the-ear types like the Lumen. Still, they are very lightweight and comfortable, so it really depends on how noticeable they are on you and whether having a visible hearing aid bothers you. They run off of a standard hearing aid battery size 312. These last about a week, and the Lumen comes packaged with several packs of batteries. 

Fitting the hearing aid involves using a cardboard sizer to select the correct length of tubing and then choosing the earpiece that works the best for you. A wide selection of both is included in the package. Setup then continues through the app.

I have hearing loss in one ear (unilateral). The Lexi app correctly identified that anyone with unilateral hearing loss should be examined by a physician to see if there is an underlying issue that needs to be addressed, which not all OTC tests do. Like other OTC hearing aids, the Lexi app administers a hearing test. While selecting a quiet environment is critical, the Lexi app does not tell you if your current environment is quiet enough. Unlike the other apps I have tried, sequential tests conducted in the same quiet environment showed significantly different hearing profiles. Sometimes it showed me having diminished mid-range hearing, but normal high and low end, which is exactly the opposite of what a professional test and tests from Jabra and Sony OTC aids showed. Once it showed me with completely normal hearing in both ears. It usually showed me with relatively normal high-end hearing, which I can guarantee is not correct. The app stores your most recent profiles and you can revert to any one of them, including selecting a different profile for each ear. This is handy, but would be even handier if it showed you what the profile looked like rather than just the date and time it was created.

Once you’ve set up the Lumen, you can select from six different environment modes, including using a companion mic or a telecoil. “Music” was actually the most natural sound for me, but it also amplified a lot of background noises that natural hearing (and other hearing aids I've used) don't amplify. I ended up setting them on “Everyday” to block the background noise, accepting some reduced naturalness to the sound.

As far as sound clarity, the Lexi Lumen was quite good, but for me it had a rather unusual glitch that I still haven’t been able to resolve, even with help from Lexi’s support line. When a sudden noise occurs (think of a book opening, a microwave oven alarm, or a knock at the door) the Lumen initially mutes the sound before bringing it up to a normal volume. While only about half a second, it is very distracting. Since I only wear one hearing aid, sounds initially appeared to be coming from the unaided side until the Lexi caught up. Changing the environment to “Music” improved this, but this mode amplifies a lot of frequencies that could best be described as background static - perfect for picking up the nuances in music, not so good for walking around. I have been working with Lexi support to find out why this is happening, but so far we have no resolution. The support team’s approach is to have you try a different setting / earpiece and live with it a few days, at which point they’ll call you back. Well, actually, you end up having to call them back, as I have yet to have them actually make the promised follow-on call. If we get this issue corrected, it would significantly change my impression of these. I will post an updated review should that happen.

If you have hearing loss, any hearing aid will change your life, and in that respect the Lexi Lumen may deliver what you need. Overall, though, there are better choices out there."
10,BestBuy,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,very comfortable,"So far, I have been enjoying these hearing aids.  But I have noticed a few things and why I am giving them a 3-star rating.  I have pretty bad hearing loss in my left ear and right ear.  Left ear more so.  I can tell these are on in the right ear easy as I get static when I adjust or touch the right hearing aid.  My left ear though, I don't get that static and I only can tell it's on because in the app I can have it beep in whatever hearing aid.  I also feel like the left ear is much lower sounding.  I am assuming this is due to having worse hearing loss in my left ear and so its maxed out.  Sad if this is the case as I have used others that seem to get louder.  I also noticed that on my right ear, if I adjust the volume past 6 or so, it starts to get static/distorted.  Same when you might turn on an audio device and turn it up too loud for what the speakers can handle.  

The app, to set up, it has you go thru a hearing test.  This is normal and I don't mind that.  However, instead of short beeps, it would just do a single long beep.  I prefer the short beeps.  Would be nice to have that as an option.  It would also be nice if you could input your own hearing loss diagram.  Or customize it.  

Batteries, why now a days they did not go with rechargeables I don't know.  Would be nice if they could have made it so you could place in the case and have the case charge.  That said, these do last about a week of normal wear.  That brings up another issue, to turn these off, you have to open the battery compartment.  I would have liked to see this future in the app so that I could turn off easily while keeping in my ear.  there are times I want to briefly turn off but don't want to have to take them out.  

These are also partial Bluetooth from what you might expect when you hear they are Bluetooth.  That being that they connect to your phone via Bluetooth.  However, you can't listen to music, videos etc.  you can only control them via the app.  

Now for comfort.  This is one reason why I am giving this a 3 star instead of a 2.  These are my favorite hearing aid style.  I like that they go behind the ear and then a tube inside the ear canal.  I have used these all day and not have them fall out.  My left ear were earbuds usually sit at has a lump.  So, it causes most hearing buds to fall out as they don't go in as far because of this.  With these, because they don't rely on sitting in the ear, I had no issues with them coming out.  I also in a way like this style because it lets everyone around me know that I do have a hearing loss.  This isn't something to be ashamed of.  This also seems too not have anyone question if I have ear buds in.  

Like I mentioned, with these I would have liked to see rechargeable batteries, and a way for them to be able to allow you to listen to your device at the same time.  And better speaker for them for those with more severe hearing loss.  They have a Bose one that is a little more expensive, but I believe those are like I mentioned above, that sit in your ear.  I like this style (or ones that are straight that just go into the ear canal)."
10,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Great Choice If You Have Need,"Lexie Hearing - Lexie Lumen OTC Hearing Aids: An excellent choice if you need them.

So my dad is living with us for a year or so after losing my mom unexpectedly. The wife and I {along with my brother and other family members) have noted for YEARS that his hearing has been getting progressively worse. After living with us for as long as he had, it was blatantly obvious to EVERYONE that his hearing was rapidly depleteing.

Unfortunately, he continually denied it. Even though both of his brothers and 2 of 3 of nephews have worn hearing aids for years, he simply denied it.

Well, we finally had the difficult conversation and he agreed that we were probably right... When I gave him the chance to look over these and read the Best Buy tech spec's he agreed to try them out. I can tell you, he is glad he did!

He is much more connected in coversations, more aware of things happening around him AND he has turned the TV volume down significantly.

After downloading the app, set up was pretty easy. We had him going in a fairly short time. The app was easy to use and laid out very well. As for comfort, he has worn them for hours at a time and had no complaints, at least after a couple days to ""burn them in"". He has used them in multipe social settings, while driving, at a Colorado Avalanche game, skiing. All with no problems.

These are a high-end medical device and I would whole-heartedly reccomend them to a friend!"
10,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Affordable Option For Average Hearing Problems,"BOX:   In the box you will get the hearing aids in a case, extra batteries, a user manual, quick start guide, alternate tubes, different sized tips, measuring tool, drying capsules, cleaning wire and a tool to clean your hearing aids.  These come in a nice, compact, convenient case, kind of like what you would keep ear buds in.

ASSEMBLY:   I was able to put the batteries in (at the bottom of each hearing aid), chose my tube length for around the ear and get these set up pretty quickly.   It is simple to change the tube length after using the measuring tool.  They unplug and plug in with ease.  The tubes are even labeled left and right to make it easy for you.

CONTROLS:   The hearing aids themselves have buttons to help control your hearing.  Each hearing aid has these buttons.  The top button is a program button, which helps change the settings for regular and background programs, along with 2 other options.  There is also volume up and down.

LEXIE APP & SETUP:   If you find, like I do, that the buttons are not easy to control, these hearing aids are designed to work with the Lexie App.  The aids are connected to your phone via Bluetooth.  Just because these are connected to your phone through Bluetooth does not mean you can stream music with them.  They weren’t designed for that.  The app walks you through the set up process by answering some questions and even does a hearing check to help with the programming to help you hear better.

PERSONAL RESULTS:  I have found that I can hear much better while watching television at a lower volume, which my family loves.  I can now hear conversations while in a crowded environment, such as parties, restaurants, etc. This was one of my biggest obstacles.  I was nodding my head (because my mouth reading wasn’t always accurate) and I have had some pretty embarrassing moments.  So glad that won’t be happening again, since I can hear so much better in 
these types of environment.  

SUPPORT:   If you have questions, the support team is excellent in helping you to get these working right for you.

For the price of these, you are getting updated hearing aids for less than getting them through a doctor.  If you are on a budget and can’t get hearing aids through your insurance, these are a reasonably priced option."
10,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Great alternative to prescription hearing aids!,"I got these as a gift for my father-in-law who has tried both in-ear, and over-the-ear hearing aids.  Overall, he likes them, and they are comfortable.

They have replaceable batteries which is a plus as you don't have to recharge them on a daily basis. So far, battery life is good and additional batteries are included. Batteries are also available at just about every retailer and online.

The retention wire does a good job of keeping the hearing aids in place. The volume control works well and the environment control button does a good job with background noise.

Unfortunately, there's no on/off switch so you have to remove the batteries to turn them off. Although this preserves battery life, the downside is the hole for the batteries is very small. An older person and/or someone with unsteady hands might have a difficult time replacing the batteries.

The app was easy to install and the hearing test allows you to tailor the aids for your specific needs.

Unfortunately, they are little bit large and noticeable so if you're someone who is self-conscious about hearing aids, the in-ear type might be preferable.

However, the biggest advantage to these is the price! No need to spend thousands of dollars or take multiple trips to the audiologist for custom hearing aids.  

These do a great job and get five stars for sure!"
10,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Great affordable OTC hearing aids!,"These hearing aids are very nice compared to the much higher priced aids. They have a 45 day money-back guarantee. You don't need an appointment to get them as they are FDA-regulated. They have replaceable batteries. They are sweatproof and have noise reduction and feedback cancellation. There is an app where the user can have more control including the adjustable volume.  You are able to use FSA and HSA dollars to pay. Out of the box they are very easy to fit and use. The app has a hearing check so it can be setup just for your hearing. What I liked is the hearing aids have directional hearing so you know where the sound is coming from. Some aids don't have that and you have to try and figure out where the sound came from. The lexie has a subscription where if you pay the monthly cost you get a care kit that will send you batteries as well as accessories. What was also nice about the app is you can choose what hearing environment you are in. It has every day use, noisy indoor, music, outdoor, telecoil or companion mic. If you are looking for a reasonably priced hearing aids these should be on your list."
10,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,"One year check in,  Unit works support outstanding","product is iffy that no seniors like to use it and I don't have a hearing problem I was hoping for a lot more/

Most important feature is customer service,l By all means this company is aggressive and desire satisfaction from its clients which is notable and appreciated.

Because hearing aids are excessively expensive a reasonably intelligent person who has smartphone experience with small buttons and patients can make excellent use of this product

However maintenance and comfort are very questionable, The unit has sticking wire Straps hanging out of the year, Easily perishable Plastic extenders into the ear

And its tiny button control system located on the device is a nuisance for most aged people who also use their smartphones at best for just making phone calls not adjusting features

With its support structure and it's still functionality after a year it has some very good positives.  Support is very important for such devices and they do have a good support team they literally check up on the User's product to lend a hand

Again I will keep my eye open on this company as they Address these issues I am sure that they will make an application that is easy for seniors to use to control the hearing aid and that less interaction with Small buttons and replacement parts will be made.

I strongly think they should probably ask Bose for their noise cancelation technology an earbud design which is more user friendly and adds a feature that helps greatly with senior hearing

But that would best be a good suggestion that probably will not happen"
10,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Works well with iPhone,Very happy with my purchase of Lexie Lumen. I got the light grey model which looks great and is very discrete. Setting up from my iPhone was easy and it works well with different environment settings. This works better and is more comfortable than my last hearing aid that cost me over $2500.
10,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Hearing aids half the size and fraction of cost,"Hearing aids have come a long way size, technology, and affordability wise. Compared to  similar hearing aids that my grandmother has used, these Lexie Lumen OTC hearing aids are almost half the size of normal hearing aids, a fraction of the cost, and easy to setup and use with bluetooth technology and the use of their app to go through the process and take the hearing check to really have these work best for your specific hearing deficits. With sizing and going through setup you're up and running. 

The buttons are small enough to not be bulky but at the same time raised enough to function easily at the touch of your finger.  There Adaptive Noise Reduction helps to differentiate between 
sounds which are more speech-like or more noise-like. They include multiple tip sizes so you're set for pretty much any size ear whether it small, medium, or large. It comes with a nice carrying case as well.

I have recently had issues with fluid build up in my ear and slightly diminished hearing. I've been having to pop my ears to get the sound back.  My ENT doctor has said I may need a procedure to fix this but in the mean time these have definitely been a blessing in disguise. It can be extremely frustrating when you're asking someone to repeat what they've said or you aren't able to comprehend due to mild hearing loss. I would definitely recommend these to others"
10,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Tears of happiness,"For some context on the user, I had my 80 year old grandmother use these hearing aids because whenever any of us in the family talk to her, she says that we are mumbling and she can't understand what we're saying, blaming us as the reason for her not being able to hear us well.

My grandmother and my grandfather always have the television volume up to near the max that whenever we visit their house it's hard to hear and we need to lower the volume.

After gifting these to my grandmother (I wish I had a second pair for my grandfather), there was no noticeable difference immediately which is normal. In addition she didn't want to believe that her hearing was the issue.

After about a week, it seemed so subtle, but it was great news in a funny way. She said we're now too loud! Which we were happy to hear. She can definitely hear much better.

Wanted to share this review in a story-like format of how it has helped our family grow closer. Simply put, they work. Give them a shot. It's worth it."

Had bought two different OTC hearing aids from different companies and the wouldn't hold a charge (there were supposedly rechargeable). These are battery operated and batteries have last 8+ days.  Still struggle with noisy situations, but don't know if that is the hearing aids or my own hearing loss issues."

10,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,comfortable and work great,"Hearing aids without a doctor; sounds interesting. I have a tad bit of hearing loss but not enough to try and get hearing aids in all reality.  So, these are fun to try out and see how much they help.   I love the setup of these buds, everything is through the app.  You take them out stick the battery in, open the app and it walks you through setting them up.  When I first opened the container I was a little overwhelmed with all the little tubs but I quickly realized those are just to give everyone some customizability and all those are really needed once you find the one that fits you.  I got the Bluetooth all setup and it gave me a hearing test and then customized the sound to my ear test results.  There are different modes to try out and I immediately noticed the difference when in a noisy environment, these allow me to pick out conversations way more easily That has been a really nice feature of using these.  The other place I really noticed that these helped was in the car, I can easily hear my kid talk to me from the back seat which was really convenient.  There are two things that I don’t like; one is that they don’t have rechargeable batteries. Rechargeable batteries are just so much more convenient and save money over time.  The other thing that I don’t like is that Bluetooth is built in but not Bluetooth capabilities for phone calls.  I use Bluetooth headsets to hear my conference calls better and that both aren’t compatible my ears at the same time, which I find annoying.
It's the holidays and I’m with my wife’s family; my father-in-law has wanted to try hearing aids but hasn’t gone through the trouble going to the doctor, with this it was really easy to have him try them out, I just redid the hearing test and he was super happy being able to hear all of the sudden.  Overall, I love that someone can just get these now and configure them in a quiet area and be good to go.  I think that Bluetooth phone call integration should be included, and I would much rather have rechargeable batteries but if hearing and ease of set up is your first priority these are awesome."
10,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"Lightweight, Comfortable, and High Quality Sound","The Lexie Lumen hearing aids fit well.  They are small and lightweight.  Wearing them all day didn’t cause me to have to adjust them throughout the day.  I don’t notice that they are in.  That’s saying a lot since I wear glasses.  I didn’t run into any problems over a period of 7 full days wearing the hearing aids with my glasses.  If you are worried about the ear pieces of your glasses causing problems with them, don’t worry as I didn’t have any issues.  I also had multiple conference calls while wearing them.  My headset on with the hearing aids in wasn’t uncomfortable and I was in one-to-two-hour calls without a problem.  You get multiple sets of tubes and multiple sets of tips, so you shouldn’t have any problems finding the combination that works best for you.

Battery

The hearing aids use size 312 batteries.  They come with 24 batteries.  So far, the battery in each of them are still running.  With Bluetooth built-in to them, and that being on, didn’t cause a drain on the batteries.  7am to 11pm for 7 days and I’m still running on the original batteries.  The one thing I would like to see changed is the way you power off the hearing aids.  In order to power them off, you open the battery tray.  I would be nice to have a switch to turn them off.  The problem I ran into with this is that when I pick them up in the mornings, one of the batteries would fall out of the tray.  Not that big of a deal, but as the size 312 batteries are small, I found myself hunting for a dropped battery.

Sound quality

Sound quality is nothing short of amazing.  These are so much better than my previous hearing aids.  I still have the ones I was previously using from a different manufacturer, but I will not be going back to those and will only use these now.  It took me two days to get used to these, but Lexie says to give it two weeks.  After two days, I didn’t notice the electronic enhanced sound as being that.  With my previous hearing aids, it was always noticeable, but not with the Lexie hearing aids.

App/features

Lexie has an app that you use to run a sound test so the app can setup an audio profile for you that works best for your hearing loss.  It took only a few minutes to get through the test.  Once that is done, you can adjust the volume and set different profiles based on your environment.  Currently there are six profiles.  The profiles can be selected with the push of a button on the hearing aids if you need to change profiles but don’t want to do it through your mobile device.  The app will also show you a power indicator for each hearing aid as well as get remote expert support.

I’m pleased with what Lexie has here.  I’ve tried several brands in the past and the Lexie hearing aids, by far, exceed all of the hearing aids that I’ve tried over the years.  I don’t think anyone will go wrong with these.  I can’t recommend them enough.  Well done Lexie!"
10,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Great Tech. The App Makes Them Easy To Setup,"Great Tech in these and the App makes getting them fine-tuned a breeze.  These use standard zinc-air hearing aid batteries, if somebody already has a traditional (before over the counter OTC options became available) they are already use to these types of batteries.  The batteries last about 5 to 8 days as long as you crack open the battery holder when they are not in use.  My wife had no problems installing the Lexie app and getting these setup with the easy to use hearing setup session.  The 2nd morning, the app was not responsive, and upon restarting it, it would not get past the ""programming hearing aids"" step.  Called the number that came up on the App under HELP, and had a live person helping us in literally less than a minute.  They were super helpful running through things to try in order, we had to delete the data on the app and redo the hearing setup session from scratch, but they have worked flawlessly since then.  The sound help from these after setup is exceptional.  The detail that can be picked up by those with hearing loss will vary, but my wife has reported that the everyday mode helps a lot, but the noisy indoors mode makes a big difference when music, multiple voices, sounds of multiple people moving and doing things in the kitchen.  They can hear me clearly around corners now without me raising my voice, and they were able to track me by sound all around the top floor of our house.  Just the little things like they were able to hear the raindrops hitting super clearly when the front door was opened while being all the way across the living room.  The app makes using these super easy, so you don't have to fiddle with the controls on the hearing aids themselves.  Select sound modes, adjust volume levels, check your hearing profile.  I wholeheartedly suggest these for those trying the new Over the Counter (OTC) approach to hearing aids."

Now for comfort.  This is one reason why I am giving this a 3 star instead of a 2.  These are my favorite hearing aid style.  I like that they go behind the ear and then a tube inside the ear canal.  I have used these all day and not have them fall out.  My left ear were earbuds usually sit at has a lump.  So, it causes most hearing buds to fall out as they don't go in as far because of this.  With these, because they don't rely on sitting in the ear, I had no issues with them coming out.  I also in a way like this style because it lets everyone around me know that I do have a hearing loss.  This isn't something to be ashamed of.  This also seems too not have anyone question if I have ear buds in.  

Like I mentioned, with these I would have liked to see rechargeable batteries, and a way for them to be able to allow you to listen to your device at the same time.  And better speaker for them for those with more severe hearing loss.  They have a Bose one that is a little more expensive, but I believe those are like I mentioned above, that sit in your ear.  I like this style (or ones that are straight that just go into the ear canal)."
10,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Great Choice If You Have Need,"Lexie Hearing - Lexie Lumen OTC Hearing Aids: An excellent choice if you need them.

So my dad is living with us for a year or so after losing my mom unexpectedly. The wife and I {along with my brother and other family members) have noted for YEARS that his hearing has been getting progressively worse. After living with us for as long as he had, it was blatantly obvious to EVERYONE that his hearing was rapidly depleteing.

Unfortunately, he continually denied it. Even though both of his brothers and 2 of 3 of nephews have worn hearing aids for years, he simply denied it.

Well, we finally had the difficult conversation and he agreed that we were probably right... When I gave him the chance to look over these and read the Best Buy tech spec's he agreed to try them out. I can tell you, he is glad he did!

He is much more connected in coversations, more aware of things happening around him AND he has turned the TV volume down significantly.

After downloading the app, set up was pretty easy. We had him going in a fairly short time. The app was easy to use and laid out very well. As for comfort, he has worn them for hours at a time and had no complaints, at least after a couple days to ""burn them in"". He has used them in multipe social settings, while driving, at a Colorado Avalanche game, skiing. All with no problems.

These are a high-end medical device and I would whole-heartedly reccomend them to a friend!"
10,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Affordable Option For Average Hearing Problems,"BOX:   In the box you will get the hearing aids in a case, extra batteries, a user manual, quick start guide, alternate tubes, different sized tips, measuring tool, drying capsules, cleaning wire and a tool to clean your hearing aids.  These come in a nice, compact, convenient case, kind of like what you would keep ear buds in.

ASSEMBLY:   I was able to put the batteries in (at the bottom of each hearing aid), chose my tube length for around the ear and get these set up pretty quickly.   It is simple to change the tube length after using the measuring tool.  They unplug and plug in with ease.  The tubes are even labeled left and right to make it easy for you.

CONTROLS:   The hearing aids themselves have buttons to help control your hearing.  Each hearing aid has these buttons.  The top button is a program button, which helps change the settings for regular and background programs, along with 2 other options.  There is also volume up and down.

LEXIE APP & SETUP:   If you find, like I do, that the buttons are not easy to control, these hearing aids are designed to work with the Lexie App.  The aids are connected to your phone via Bluetooth.  Just because these are connected to your phone through Bluetooth does not mean you can stream music with them.  They weren’t designed for that.  The app walks you through the set up process by answering some questions and even does a hearing check to help with the programming to help you hear better.

PERSONAL RESULTS:  I have found that I can hear much better while watching television at a lower volume, which my family loves.  I can now hear conversations while in a crowded environment, such as parties, restaurants, etc. This was one of my biggest obstacles.  I was nodding my head (because my mouth reading wasn’t always accurate) and I have had some pretty embarrassing moments.  So glad that won’t be happening again, since I can hear so much better in 
these types of environment.  

SUPPORT:   If you have questions, the support team is excellent in helping you to get these working right for you.

For the price of these, you are getting updated hearing aids for less than getting them through a doctor.  If you are on a budget and can’t get hearing aids through your insurance, these are a reasonably priced option."
10,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Great alternative to prescription hearing aids!,"I got these as a gift for my father-in-law who has tried both in-ear, and over-the-ear hearing aids.  Overall, he likes them, and they are comfortable.

They have replaceable batteries which is a plus as you don't have to recharge them on a daily basis. So far, battery life is good and additional batteries are included. Batteries are also available at just about every retailer and online.

The retention wire does a good job of keeping the hearing aids in place. The volume control works well and the environment control button does a good job with background noise.

Unfortunately, there's no on/off switch so you have to remove the batteries to turn them off. Although this preserves battery life, the downside is the hole for the batteries is very small. An older person and/or someone with unsteady hands might have a difficult time replacing the batteries.

The app was easy to install and the hearing test allows you to tailor the aids for your specific needs.

Unfortunately, they are little bit large and noticeable so if you're someone who is self-conscious about hearing aids, the in-ear type might be preferable.

However, the biggest advantage to these is the price! No need to spend thousands of dollars or take multiple trips to the audiologist for custom hearing aids.  

These do a great job and get five stars for sure!"
10,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Great affordable OTC hearing aids!,"These hearing aids are very nice compared to the much higher priced aids. They have a 45 day money-back guarantee. You don't need an appointment to get them as they are FDA-regulated. They have replaceable batteries. They are sweatproof and have noise reduction and feedback cancellation. There is an app where the user can have more control including the adjustable volume.  You are able to use FSA and HSA dollars to pay. Out of the box they are very easy to fit and use. The app has a hearing check so it can be setup just for your hearing. What I liked is the hearing aids have directional hearing so you know where the sound is coming from. Some aids don't have that and you have to try and figure out where the sound came from. The lexie has a subscription where if you pay the monthly cost you get a care kit that will send you batteries as well as accessories. What was also nice about the app is you can choose what hearing environment you are in. It has every day use, noisy indoor, music, outdoor, telecoil or companion mic. If you are looking for a reasonably priced hearing aids these should be on your list."
10,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,"One year check in,  Unit works support outstanding","product is iffy that no seniors like to use it and I don't have a hearing problem I was hoping for a lot more/

Most important feature is customer service,l By all means this company is aggressive and desire satisfaction from its clients which is notable and appreciated.

Because hearing aids are excessively expensive a reasonably intelligent person who has smartphone experience with small buttons and patients can make excellent use of this product

However maintenance and comfort are very questionable, The unit has sticking wire Straps hanging out of the year, Easily perishable Plastic extenders into the ear

And its tiny button control system located on the device is a nuisance for most aged people who also use their smartphones at best for just making phone calls not adjusting features

With its support structure and it's still functionality after a year it has some very good positives.  Support is very important for such devices and they do have a good support team they literally check up on the User's product to lend a hand

Again I will keep my eye open on this company as they Address these issues I am sure that they will make an application that is easy for seniors to use to control the hearing aid and that less interaction with Small buttons and replacement parts will be made.

I strongly think they should probably ask Bose for their noise cancelation technology an earbud design which is more user friendly and adds a feature that helps greatly with senior hearing

But that would best be a good suggestion that probably will not happen"
10,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Works well with iPhone,Very happy with my purchase of Lexie Lumen. I got the light grey model which looks great and is very discrete. Setting up from my iPhone was easy and it works well with different environment settings. This works better and is more comfortable than my last hearing aid that cost me over $2500.
10,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Hearing aids half the size and fraction of cost,"Hearing aids have come a long way size, technology, and affordability wise. Compared to  similar hearing aids that my grandmother has used, these Lexie Lumen OTC hearing aids are almost half the size of normal hearing aids, a fraction of the cost, and easy to setup and use with bluetooth technology and the use of their app to go through the process and take the hearing check to really have these work best for your specific hearing deficits. With sizing and going through setup you're up and running. 

The buttons are small enough to not be bulky but at the same time raised enough to function easily at the touch of your finger.  There Adaptive Noise Reduction helps to differentiate between 
sounds which are more speech-like or more noise-like. They include multiple tip sizes so you're set for pretty much any size ear whether it small, medium, or large. It comes with a nice carrying case as well.

I have recently had issues with fluid build up in my ear and slightly diminished hearing. I've been having to pop my ears to get the sound back.  My ENT doctor has said I may need a procedure to fix this but in the mean time these have definitely been a blessing in disguise. It can be extremely frustrating when you're asking someone to repeat what they've said or you aren't able to comprehend due to mild hearing loss. I would definitely recommend these to others"
10,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Tears of happiness,"For some context on the user, I had my 80 year old grandmother use these hearing aids because whenever any of us in the family talk to her, she says that we are mumbling and she can't understand what we're saying, blaming us as the reason for her not being able to hear us well.

My grandmother and my grandfather always have the television volume up to near the max that whenever we visit their house it's hard to hear and we need to lower the volume.

After gifting these to my grandmother (I wish I had a second pair for my grandfather), there was no noticeable difference immediately which is normal. In addition she didn't want to believe that her hearing was the issue.

After about a week, it seemed so subtle, but it was great news in a funny way. She said we're now too loud! Which we were happy to hear. She can definitely hear much better.

Wanted to share this review in a story-like format of how it has helped our family grow closer. Simply put, they work. Give them a shot. It's worth it."

10,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Would recommend the OTC hearing aids.,"I am overall pleased with these hearing aids.  Had bought two different OTC hearing aids from different companies and the wouldn't hold a charge (there were supposedly rechargeable). These are battery operated and batteries have last 8+ days.  Still struggle with noisy situations, but don't know if that is the hearing aids or my own hearing loss issues."

10,BestBuy,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,Not Rechargeable!,At this price point I was unpleasantly surprised to find that the batteries are not rechargeable. You have to go deep into the specs to find this out. I would not recommend this unit.

10,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,comfortable and work great,"Hearing aids without a doctor; sounds interesting. I have a tad bit of hearing loss but not enough to try and get hearing aids in all reality.  So, these are fun to try out and see how much they help.   I love the setup of these buds, everything is through the app.  You take them out stick the battery in, open the app and it walks you through setting them up.  When I first opened the container I was a little overwhelmed with all the little tubs but I quickly realized those are just to give everyone some customizability and all those are really needed once you find the one that fits you.  I got the Bluetooth all setup and it gave me a hearing test and then customized the sound to my ear test results.  There are different modes to try out and I immediately noticed the difference when in a noisy environment, these allow me to pick out conversations way more easily That has been a really nice feature of using these.  The other place I really noticed that these helped was in the car, I can easily hear my kid talk to me from the back seat which was really convenient.  There are two things that I don’t like; one is that they don’t have rechargeable batteries. Rechargeable batteries are just so much more convenient and save money over time.  The other thing that I don’t like is that Bluetooth is built in but not Bluetooth capabilities for phone calls.  I use Bluetooth headsets to hear my conference calls better and that both aren’t compatible my ears at the same time, which I find annoying.
It's the holidays and I’m with my wife’s family; my father-in-law has wanted to try hearing aids but hasn’t gone through the trouble going to the doctor, with this it was really easy to have him try them out, I just redid the hearing test and he was super happy being able to hear all of the sudden.  Overall, I love that someone can just get these now and configure them in a quiet area and be good to go.  I think that Bluetooth phone call integration should be included, and I would much rather have rechargeable batteries but if hearing and ease of set up is your first priority these are awesome."
10,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"Lightweight, Comfortable, and High Quality Sound","The Lexie Lumen hearing aids fit well.  They are small and lightweight.  Wearing them all day didn’t cause me to have to adjust them throughout the day.  I don’t notice that they are in.  That’s saying a lot since I wear glasses.  I didn’t run into any problems over a period of 7 full days wearing the hearing aids with my glasses.  If you are worried about the ear pieces of your glasses causing problems with them, don’t worry as I didn’t have any issues.  I also had multiple conference calls while wearing them.  My headset on with the hearing aids in wasn’t uncomfortable and I was in one-to-two-hour calls without a problem.  You get multiple sets of tubes and multiple sets of tips, so you shouldn’t have any problems finding the combination that works best for you.

Battery

The hearing aids use size 312 batteries.  They come with 24 batteries.  So far, the battery in each of them are still running.  With Bluetooth built-in to them, and that being on, didn’t cause a drain on the batteries.  7am to 11pm for 7 days and I’m still running on the original batteries.  The one thing I would like to see changed is the way you power off the hearing aids.  In order to power them off, you open the battery tray.  I would be nice to have a switch to turn them off.  The problem I ran into with this is that when I pick them up in the mornings, one of the batteries would fall out of the tray.  Not that big of a deal, but as the size 312 batteries are small, I found myself hunting for a dropped battery.

Sound quality

Sound quality is nothing short of amazing.  These are so much better than my previous hearing aids.  I still have the ones I was previously using from a different manufacturer, but I will not be going back to those and will only use these now.  It took me two days to get used to these, but Lexie says to give it two weeks.  After two days, I didn’t notice the electronic enhanced sound as being that.  With my previous hearing aids, it was always noticeable, but not with the Lexie hearing aids.

App/features

Lexie has an app that you use to run a sound test so the app can setup an audio profile for you that works best for your hearing loss.  It took only a few minutes to get through the test.  Once that is done, you can adjust the volume and set different profiles based on your environment.  Currently there are six profiles.  The profiles can be selected with the push of a button on the hearing aids if you need to change profiles but don’t want to do it through your mobile device.  The app will also show you a power indicator for each hearing aid as well as get remote expert support.

I’m pleased with what Lexie has here.  I’ve tried several brands in the past and the Lexie hearing aids, by far, exceed all of the hearing aids that I’ve tried over the years.  I don’t think anyone will go wrong with these.  I can’t recommend them enough.  Well done Lexie!"
10,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Great Tech. The App Makes Them Easy To Setup,"Great Tech in these and the App makes getting them fine-tuned a breeze.  These use standard zinc-air hearing aid batteries, if somebody already has a traditional (before over the counter OTC options became available) they are already use to these types of batteries.  The batteries last about 5 to 8 days as long as you crack open the battery holder when they are not in use.  My wife had no problems installing the Lexie app and getting these setup with the easy to use hearing setup session.  The 2nd morning, the app was not responsive, and upon restarting it, it would not get past the ""programming hearing aids"" step.  Called the number that came up on the App under HELP, and had a live person helping us in literally less than a minute.  They were super helpful running through things to try in order, we had to delete the data on the app and redo the hearing setup session from scratch, but they have worked flawlessly since then.  The sound help from these after setup is exceptional.  The detail that can be picked up by those with hearing loss will vary, but my wife has reported that the everyday mode helps a lot, but the noisy indoors mode makes a big difference when music, multiple voices, sounds of multiple people moving and doing things in the kitchen.  They can hear me clearly around corners now without me raising my voice, and they were able to track me by sound all around the top floor of our house.  Just the little things like they were able to hear the raindrops hitting super clearly when the front door was opened while being all the way across the living room.  The app makes using these super easy, so you don't have to fiddle with the controls on the hearing aids themselves.  Select sound modes, adjust volume levels, check your hearing profile.  I wholeheartedly suggest these for those trying the new Over the Counter (OTC) approach to hearing aids."
10,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,A Great Pair Of Hearing Aids!,"When I first received the Lexie Lumen OTC hearing aids, I could not get them to pair with the Lexie Application. I received a second set after calling Lexie's customer service department and these paired right out of the box with no issues.

The Lexie hearing aids, powered by Bose, sit snugly behind your ears and connect to your inner ears via a clear plastic cable that is almost invisible. The hearing aid bodies are hardly seen due to their small footprint and high mounting abehind your ears. The color of the Lexie hearing aides I have is gray and blend in with my hair color nicely. The in-ear cords can hardly be seen, are quite small and go into your ear and out of sight.

The Lexie App was easy to download and install on my iPhone. The application allows you to control the volume and sound quality (treble and bass) and is very well thought out. Settings include adjusting between treble and bass, sound balance between ears, sound directionality - front only or from everywhere - and environments - noisy indoor, outdoors, music and everyday.

The Lexie Lumen OTC B-1 Hearing Aids powered by Bose are a very good investment and work very well in helping you hear in most any environment."
10,BestBuy,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,There are better choices out there,"The first thing you may notice about the Lexi Lumen, particularly if they aren't your first hearing aids, is that they are relatively large. They are larger than my previous professional model, and significantly larger than my current professional aid, both of which are over-the-ear types like the Lumen. Still, they are very lightweight and comfortable, so it really depends on how noticeable they are on you and whether having a visible hearing aid bothers you. They run off of a standard hearing aid battery size 312. These last about a week, and the Lumen comes packaged with several packs of batteries. 

Fitting the hearing aid involves using a cardboard sizer to select the correct length of tubing and then choosing the earpiece that works the best for you. A wide selection of both is included in the package. Setup then continues through the app.

I have hearing loss in one ear (unilateral). The Lexi app correctly identified that anyone with unilateral hearing loss should be examined by a physician to see if there is an underlying issue that needs to be addressed, which not all OTC tests do. Like other OTC hearing aids, the Lexi app administers a hearing test. While selecting a quiet environment is critical, the Lexi app does not tell you if your current environment is quiet enough. Unlike the other apps I have tried, sequential tests conducted in the same quiet environment showed significantly different hearing profiles. Sometimes it showed me having diminished mid-range hearing, but normal high and low end, which is exactly the opposite of what a professional test and tests from Jabra and Sony OTC aids showed. Once it showed me with completely normal hearing in both ears. It usually showed me with relatively normal high-end hearing, which I can guarantee is not correct. The app stores your most recent profiles and you can revert to any one of them, including selecting a different profile for each ear. This is handy, but would be even handier if it showed you what the profile looked like rather than just the date and time it was created.

Once you’ve set up the Lumen, you can select from six different environment modes, including using a companion mic or a telecoil. “Music” was actually the most natural sound for me, but it also amplified a lot of background noises that natural hearing (and other hearing aids I've used) don't amplify. I ended up setting them on “Everyday” to block the background noise, accepting some reduced naturalness to the sound.

As far as sound clarity, the Lexi Lumen was quite good, but for me it had a rather unusual glitch that I still haven’t been able to resolve, even with help from Lexi’s support line. When a sudden noise occurs (think of a book opening, a microwave oven alarm, or a knock at the door) the Lumen initially mutes the sound before bringing it up to a normal volume. While only about half a second, it is very distracting. Since I only wear one hearing aid, sounds initially appeared to be coming from the unaided side until the Lexi caught up. Changing the environment to “Music” improved this, but this mode amplifies a lot of frequencies that could best be described as background static - perfect for picking up the nuances in music, not so good for walking around. I have been working with Lexi support to find out why this is happening, but so far we have no resolution. The support team’s approach is to have you try a different setting / earpiece and live with it a few days, at which point they’ll call you back. Well, actually, you end up having to call them back, as I have yet to have them actually make the promised follow-on call. If we get this issue corrected, it would significantly change my impression of these. I will post an updated review should that happen.

If you have hearing loss, any hearing aid will change your life, and in that respect the Lexi Lumen may deliver what you need. Overall, though, there are better choices out there."
10,BestBuy,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,very comfortable,"So far, I have been enjoying these hearing aids.  But I have noticed a few things and why I am giving them a 3-star rating.  I have pretty bad hearing loss in my left ear and right ear.  Left ear more so.  I can tell these are on in the right ear easy as I get static when I adjust or touch the right hearing aid.  My left ear though, I don't get that static and I only can tell it's on because in the app I can have it beep in whatever hearing aid.  I also feel like the left ear is much lower sounding.  I am assuming this is due to having worse hearing loss in my left ear and so its maxed out.  Sad if this is the case as I have used others that seem to get louder.  I also noticed that on my right ear, if I adjust the volume past 6 or so, it starts to get static/distorted.  Same when you might turn on an audio device and turn it up too loud for what the speakers can handle.  

The app, to set up, it has you go thru a hearing test.  This is normal and I don't mind that.  However, instead of short beeps, it would just do a single long beep.  I prefer the short beeps.  Would be nice to have that as an option.  It would also be nice if you could input your own hearing loss diagram.  Or customize it.  

Batteries, why now a days they did not go with rechargeables I don't know.  Would be nice if they could have made it so you could place in the case and have the case charge.  That said, these do last about a week of normal wear.  That brings up another issue, to turn these off, you have to open the battery compartment.  I would have liked to see this future in the app so that I could turn off easily while keeping in my ear.  there are times I want to briefly turn off but don't want to have to take them out.  

These are also partial Bluetooth from what you might expect when you hear they are Bluetooth.  That being that they connect to your phone via Bluetooth.  However, you can't listen to music, videos etc.  you can only control them via the app.

With sizing and going through setup you're up and running. 

The buttons are small enough to not be bulky but at the same time raised enough to function easily at the touch of your finger.  There Adaptive Noise Reduction helps to differentiate between 
sounds which are more speech-like or more noise-like. They include multiple tip sizes so you're set for pretty much any size ear whether it small, medium, or large. It comes with a nice carrying case as well.

I have recently had issues with fluid build up in my ear and slightly diminished hearing. I've been having to pop my ears to get the sound back.  My ENT doctor has said I may need a procedure to fix this but in the mean time these have definitely been a blessing in disguise.

10,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Tears of happiness,"For some context on the user, I had my 80 year old grandmother use these hearing aids because whenever any of us in the family talk to her, she says that we are mumbling and she can't understand what we're saying, blaming us as the reason for her not being able to hear us well.

My grandmother and my grandfather always have the television volume up to near the max that whenever we visit their house it's hard to hear and we need to lower the volume.

After gifting these to my grandmother (I wish I had a second pair for my grandfather), there was no noticeable difference immediately which is normal. In addition she didn't want to believe that her hearing was the issue.

After about a week, it seemed so subtle, but it was great news in a funny way. She said we're now too loud! Which we were happy to hear. She can definitely hear much better.

Wanted to share this review in a story-like format of how it has helped our family grow closer. Simply put, they work. Give them a shot. It's worth it."

10,BestBuy,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Poor material and performance,Very cheap quality. Too much noise and the material is very cheap. Broke within 1 week and brand refused to repair for free. Will never suggest anyone.
10,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,comfortable and work great,"Hearing aids without a doctor; sounds interesting. I have a tad bit of hearing loss but not enough to try and get hearing aids in all reality.  So, these are fun to try out and see how much they help.   I love the setup of these buds, everything is through the app.  You take them out stick the battery in, open the app and it walks you through setting them up.  When I first opened the container I was a little overwhelmed with all the little tubs but I quickly realized those are just to give everyone some customizability and all those are really needed once you find the one that fits you.  I got the Bluetooth all setup and it gave me a hearing test and then customized the sound to my ear test results.  There are different modes to try out and I immediately noticed the difference when in a noisy environment, these allow me to pick out conversations way more easily That has been a really nice feature of using these.  The other place I really noticed that these helped was in the car, I can easily hear my kid talk to me from the back seat which was really convenient.  There are two things that I don’t like; one is that they don’t have rechargeable batteries. Rechargeable batteries are just so much more convenient and save money over time.  The other thing that I don’t like is that Bluetooth is built in but not Bluetooth capabilities for phone calls.  I use Bluetooth headsets to hear my conference calls better and that both aren’t compatible my ears at the same time, which I find annoying.
It's the holidays and I’m with my wife’s family; my father-in-law has wanted to try hearing aids but hasn’t gone through the trouble going to the doctor, with this it was really easy to have him try them out, I just redid the hearing test and he was super happy being able to hear all of the sudden.  Overall, I love that someone can just get these now and configure them in a quiet area and be good to go.  I think that Bluetooth phone call integration should be included, and I would much rather have rechargeable batteries but if hearing and ease of set up is your first priority these are awesome."
10,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"Lightweight, Comfortable, and High Quality Sound","The Lexie Lumen hearing aids fit well.  They are small and lightweight.  Wearing them all day didn’t cause me to have to adjust them throughout the day.  I don’t notice that they are in.  That’s saying a lot since I wear glasses.  I didn’t run into any problems over a period of 7 full days wearing the hearing aids with my glasses.  If you are worried about the ear pieces of your glasses causing problems with them, don’t worry as I didn’t have any issues.  I also had multiple conference calls while wearing them.  My headset on with the hearing aids in wasn’t uncomfortable and I was in one-to-two-hour calls without a problem.  You get multiple sets of tubes and multiple sets of tips, so you shouldn’t have any problems finding the combination that works best for you.

Battery

The hearing aids use size 312 batteries.  They come with 24 batteries.  So far, the battery in each of them are still running.  With Bluetooth built-in to them, and that being on, didn’t cause a drain on the batteries.  7am to 11pm for 7 days and I’m still running on the original batteries.  The one thing I would like to see changed is the way you power off the hearing aids.  In order to power them off, you open the battery tray.  I would be nice to have a switch to turn them off.  The problem I ran into with this is that when I pick them up in the mornings, one of the batteries would fall out of the tray.  Not that big of a deal, but as the size 312 batteries are small, I found myself hunting for a dropped battery.

Sound quality

Sound quality is nothing short of amazing.  These are so much better than my previous hearing aids.  I still have the ones I was previously using from a different manufacturer, but I will not be going back to those and will only use these now.  It took me two days to get used to these, but Lexie says to give it two weeks.  After two days, I didn’t notice the electronic enhanced sound as being that.  With my previous hearing aids, it was always noticeable, but not with the Lexie hearing aids.

App/features

Lexie has an app that you use to run a sound test so the app can setup an audio profile for you that works best for your hearing loss.  It took only a few minutes to get through the test.  Once that is done, you can adjust the volume and set different profiles based on your environment.  Currently there are six profiles.  The profiles can be selected with the push of a button on the hearing aids if you need to change profiles but don’t want to do it through your mobile device.  The app will also show you a power indicator for each hearing aid as well as get remote expert support.

I’m pleased with what Lexie has here.  I’ve tried several brands in the past and the Lexie hearing aids, by far, exceed all of the hearing aids that I’ve tried over the years.  I don’t think anyone will go wrong with these.  I can’t recommend them enough.  Well done Lexie!"
10,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Great Tech. The App Makes Them Easy To Setup,"Great Tech in these and the App makes getting them fine-tuned a breeze.  These use standard zinc-air hearing aid batteries, if somebody already has a traditional (before over the counter OTC options became available) they are already use to these types of batteries.  The batteries last about 5 to 8 days as long as you crack open the battery holder when they are not in use.  My wife had no problems installing the Lexie app and getting these setup with the easy to use hearing setup session.  The 2nd morning, the app was not responsive, and upon restarting it, it would not get past the ""programming hearing aids"" step.  Called the number that came up on the App under HELP, and had a live person helping us in literally less than a minute.  They were super helpful running through things to try in order, we had to delete the data on the app and redo the hearing setup session from scratch, but they have worked flawlessly since then.  The sound help from these after setup is exceptional.  The detail that can be picked up by those with hearing loss will vary, but my wife has reported that the everyday mode helps a lot, but the noisy indoors mode makes a big difference when music, multiple voices, sounds of multiple people moving and doing things in the kitchen.  They can hear me clearly around corners now without me raising my voice, and they were able to track me by sound all around the top floor of our house.  Just the little things like they were able to hear the raindrops hitting super clearly when the front door was opened while being all the way across the living room.  The app makes using these super easy, so you don't have to fiddle with the controls on the hearing aids themselves.  Select sound modes, adjust volume levels, check your hearing profile.  I wholeheartedly suggest these for those trying the new Over the Counter (OTC) approach to hearing aids."
10,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,A Great Pair Of Hearing Aids!,"When I first received the Lexie Lumen OTC hearing aids, I could not get them to pair with the Lexie Application. I received a second set after calling Lexie's customer service department and these paired right out of the box with no issues.

The Lexie hearing aids, powered by Bose, sit snugly behind your ears and connect to your inner ears via a clear plastic cable that is almost invisible. The hearing aid bodies are hardly seen due to their small footprint and high mounting abehind your ears. The color of the Lexie hearing aides I have is gray and blend in with my hair color nicely. The in-ear cords can hardly be seen, are quite small and go into your ear and out of sight.

The Lexie App was easy to download and install on my iPhone. The application allows you to control the volume and sound quality (treble and bass) and is very well thought out. Settings include adjusting between treble and bass, sound balance between ears, sound directionality - front only or from everywhere - and environments - noisy indoor, outdoors, music and everyday.

The Lexie Lumen OTC B-1 Hearing Aids powered by Bose are a very good investment and work very well in helping you hear in most any environment."
10,BestBuy,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,There are better choices out there,"The first thing you may notice about the Lexi Lumen, particularly if they aren't your first hearing aids, is that they are relatively large. They are larger than my previous professional model, and significantly larger than my current professional aid, both of which are over-the-ear types like the Lumen. Still, they are very lightweight and comfortable, so it really depends on how noticeable they are on you and whether having a visible hearing aid bothers you. They run off of a standard hearing aid battery size 312. These last about a week, and the Lumen comes packaged with several packs of batteries. 

Fitting the hearing aid involves using a cardboard sizer to select the correct length of tubing and then choosing the earpiece that works the best for you. A wide selection of both is included in the package. Setup then continues through the app.

I have hearing loss in one ear (unilateral). The Lexi app correctly identified that anyone with unilateral hearing loss should be examined by a physician to see if there is an underlying issue that needs to be addressed, which not all OTC tests do. Like other OTC hearing aids, the Lexi app administers a hearing test. While selecting a quiet environment is critical, the Lexi app does not tell you if your current environment is quiet enough. Unlike the other apps I have tried, sequential tests conducted in the same quiet environment showed significantly different hearing profiles. Sometimes it showed me having diminished mid-range hearing, but normal high and low end, which is exactly the opposite of what a professional test and tests from Jabra and Sony OTC aids showed. Once it showed me with completely normal hearing in both ears. It usually showed me with relatively normal high-end hearing, which I can guarantee is not correct. The app stores your most recent profiles and you can revert to any one of them, including selecting a different profile for each ear. This is handy, but would be even handier if it showed you what the profile looked like rather than just the date and time it was created.

Once you’ve set up the Lumen, you can select from six different environment modes, including using a companion mic or a telecoil. “Music” was actually the most natural sound for me, but it also amplified a lot of background noises that natural hearing (and other hearing aids I've used) don't amplify. I ended up setting them on “Everyday” to block the background noise, accepting some reduced naturalness to the sound.

As far as sound clarity, the Lexi Lumen was quite good, but for me it had a rather unusual glitch that I still haven’t been able to resolve, even with help from Lexi’s support line. When a sudden noise occurs (think of a book opening, a microwave oven alarm, or a knock at the door) the Lumen initially mutes the sound before bringing it up to a normal volume. While only about half a second, it is very distracting. Since I only wear one hearing aid, sounds initially appeared to be coming from the unaided side until the Lexi caught up. Changing the environment to “Music” improved this, but this mode amplifies a lot of frequencies that could best be described as background static - perfect for picking up the nuances in music, not so good for walking around. I have been working with Lexi support to find out why this is happening, but so far we have no resolution. The support team’s approach is to have you try a different setting / earpiece and live with it a few days, at which point they’ll call you back. Well, actually, you end up having to call them back, as I have yet to have them actually make the promised follow-on call. If we get this issue corrected, it would significantly change my impression of these. I will post an updated review should that happen.

If you have hearing loss, any hearing aid will change your life, and in that respect the Lexi Lumen may deliver what you need. Overall, though, there are better choices out there."
10,BestBuy,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,very comfortable,"So far, I have been enjoying these hearing aids.  But I have noticed a few things and why I am giving them a 3-star rating.  I have pretty bad hearing loss in my left ear and right ear.  Left ear more so.  I can tell these are on in the right ear easy as I get static when I adjust or touch the right hearing aid.  My left ear though, I don't get that static and I only can tell it's on because in the app I can have it beep in whatever hearing aid.  I also feel like the left ear is much lower sounding.  I am assuming this is due to having worse hearing loss in my left ear and so its maxed out.  Sad if this is the case as I have used others that seem to get louder.  I also noticed that on my right ear, if I adjust the volume past 6 or so, it starts to get static/distorted.  Same when you might turn on an audio device and turn it up too loud for what the speakers can handle.  

The app, to set up, it has you go thru a hearing test.  This is normal and I don't mind that.  However, instead of short beeps, it would just do a single long beep.  I prefer the short beeps.  Would be nice to have that as an option.  It would also be nice if you could input your own hearing loss diagram.  Or customize it.  

Batteries, why now a days they did not go with rechargeables I don't know.  Would be nice if they could have made it so you could place in the case and have the case charge.  That said, these do last about a week of normal wear.  That brings up another issue, to turn these off, you have to open the battery compartment.  I would have liked to see this future in the app so that I could turn off easily while keeping in my ear.  there are times I want to briefly turn off but don't want to have to take them out.  

These are also partial Bluetooth from what you might expect when you hear they are Bluetooth.  That being that they connect to your phone via Bluetooth.  However, you can't listen to music, videos etc.  you can only control them via the app.  

Now for comfort.  This is one reason why I am giving this a 3 star instead of a 2.  These are my favorite hearing aid style.  I like that they go behind the ear and then a tube inside the ear canal.  I have used these all day and not have them fall out.  My left ear were earbuds usually sit at has a lump.  So, it causes most hearing buds to fall out as they don't go in as far because of this.  With these, because they don't rely on sitting in the ear, I had no issues with them coming out.  I also in a way like this style because it lets everyone around me know that I do have a hearing loss.  This isn't something to be ashamed of.  This also seems too not have anyone question if I have ear buds in.  

Like I mentioned, with these I would have liked to see rechargeable batteries, and a way for them to be able to allow you to listen to your device at the same time.  And better speaker for them for those with more severe hearing loss.  They have a Bose one that is a little more expensive, but I believe those are like I mentioned above, that sit in your ear.  I like this style (or ones that are straight that just go into the ear canal)."
10,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Great Choice If You Have Need,"Lexie Hearing - Lexie Lumen OTC Hearing Aids: An excellent choice if you need them.

So my dad is living with us for a year or so after losing my mom unexpectedly. The wife and I {along with my brother and other family members) have noted for YEARS that his hearing has been getting progressively worse. After living with us for as long as he had, it was blatantly obvious to EVERYONE that his hearing was rapidly depleteing.

Unfortunately, he continually denied it. Even though both of his brothers and 2 of 3 of nephews have worn hearing aids for years, he simply denied it.

Well, we finally had the difficult conversation and he agreed that we were probably right... When I gave him the chance to look over these and read the Best Buy tech spec's he agreed to try them out. I can tell you, he is glad he did!

He is much more connected in coversations, more aware of things happening around him AND he has turned the TV volume down significantly.

After downloading the app, set up was pretty easy. We had him going in a fairly short time. The app was easy to use and laid out very well. As for comfort, he has worn them for hours at a time and had no complaints, at least after a couple days to ""burn them in"". He has used them in multipe social settings, while driving, at a Colorado Avalanche game, skiing. All with no problems.

These are a high-end medical device and I would whole-heartedly reccomend them to a friend!"
10,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Affordable Option For Average Hearing Problems,"BOX:   In the box you will get the hearing aids in a case, extra batteries, a user manual, quick start guide, alternate tubes, different sized tips, measuring tool, drying capsules, cleaning wire and a tool to clean your hearing aids.  These come in a nice, compact, convenient case, kind of like what you would keep ear buds in.

ASSEMBLY:   I was able to put the batteries in (at the bottom of each hearing aid), chose my tube length for around the ear and get these set up pretty quickly.   It is simple to change the tube length after using the measuring tool.  They unplug and plug in with ease.  The tubes are even labeled left and right to make it easy for you.

CONTROLS:   The hearing aids themselves have buttons to help control your hearing.  Each hearing aid has these buttons.  The top button is a program button, which helps change the settings for regular and background programs, along with 2 other options.  There is also volume up and down.

LEXIE APP & SETUP:   If you find, like I do, that the buttons are not easy to control, these hearing aids are designed to work with the Lexie App.  The aids are connected to your phone via Bluetooth.  Just because these are connected to your phone through Bluetooth does not mean you can stream music with them.  They weren’t designed for that.  The app walks you through the set up process by answering some questions and even does a hearing check to help with the programming to help you hear better.

PERSONAL RESULTS:  I have found that I can hear much better while watching television at a lower volume, which my family loves.  I can now hear conversations while in a crowded environment, such as parties, restaurants, etc. This was one of my biggest obstacles.  I was nodding my head (because my mouth reading wasn’t always accurate) and I have had some pretty embarrassing moments.  So glad that won’t be happening again, since I can hear so much better in 
these types of environment.  

SUPPORT:   If you have questions, the support team is excellent in helping you to get these working right for you.

For the price of these, you are getting updated hearing aids for less than getting them through a doctor.  If you are on a budget and can’t get hearing aids through your insurance, these are a reasonably priced option."
10,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Great alternative to prescription hearing aids!,"I got these as a gift for my father-in-law who has tried both in-ear, and over-the-ear hearing aids.  Overall, he likes them, and they are comfortable.

They have replaceable batteries which is a plus as you don't have to recharge them on a daily basis. So far, battery life is good and additional batteries are included. Batteries are also available at just about every retailer and online.

The retention wire does a good job of keeping the hearing aids in place. The volume control works well and the environment control button does a good job with background noise.

Unfortunately, there's no on/off switch so you have to remove the batteries to turn them off. Although this preserves battery life, the downside is the hole for the batteries is very small. An older person and/or someone with unsteady hands might have a difficult time replacing the batteries.

The app was easy to install and the hearing test allows you to tailor the aids for your specific needs.

Unfortunately, they are little bit large and noticeable so if you're someone who is self-conscious about hearing aids, the in-ear type might be preferable.

However, the biggest advantage to these is the price! No need to spend thousands of dollars or take multiple trips to the audiologist for custom hearing aids.

10,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,comfortable and work great,"Hearing aids without a doctor; sounds interesting. I have a tad bit of hearing loss but not enough to try and get hearing aids in all reality.  So, these are fun to try out and see how much they help.   I love the setup of these buds, everything is through the app.  You take them out stick the battery in, open the app and it walks you through setting them up.  When I first opened the container I was a little overwhelmed with all the little tubs but I quickly realized those are just to give everyone some customizability and all those are really needed once you find the one that fits you.  I got the Bluetooth all setup and it gave me a hearing test and then customized the sound to my ear test results.  There are different modes to try out and I immediately noticed the difference when in a noisy environment, these allow me to pick out conversations way more easily That has been a really nice feature of using these.  The other place I really noticed that these helped was in the car, I can easily hear my kid talk to me from the back seat which was really convenient.  There are two things that I don’t like; one is that they don’t have rechargeable batteries. Rechargeable batteries are just so much more convenient and save money over time.  The other thing that I don’t like is that Bluetooth is built in but not Bluetooth capabilities for phone calls.  I use Bluetooth headsets to hear my conference calls better and that both aren’t compatible my ears at the same time, which I find annoying.
It's the holidays and I’m with my wife’s family; my father-in-law has wanted to try hearing aids but hasn’t gone through the trouble going to the doctor, with this it was really easy to have him try them out, I just redid the hearing test and he was super happy being able to hear all of the sudden.  Overall, I love that someone can just get these now and configure them in a quiet area and be good to go.  I think that Bluetooth phone call integration should be included, and I would much rather have rechargeable batteries but if hearing and ease of set up is your first priority these are awesome."
10,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"Lightweight, Comfortable, and High Quality Sound","The Lexie Lumen hearing aids fit well.  They are small and lightweight.  Wearing them all day didn’t cause me to have to adjust them throughout the day.  I don’t notice that they are in.  That’s saying a lot since I wear glasses.  I didn’t run into any problems over a period of 7 full days wearing the hearing aids with my glasses.  If you are worried about the ear pieces of your glasses causing problems with them, don’t worry as I didn’t have any issues.  I also had multiple conference calls while wearing them.  My headset on with the hearing aids in wasn’t uncomfortable and I was in one-to-two-hour calls without a problem.  You get multiple sets of tubes and multiple sets of tips, so you shouldn’t have any problems finding the combination that works best for you.

Battery

The hearing aids use size 312 batteries.  They come with 24 batteries.  So far, the battery in each of them are still running.  With Bluetooth built-in to them, and that being on, didn’t cause a drain on the batteries.  7am to 11pm for 7 days and I’m still running on the original batteries.  The one thing I would like to see changed is the way you power off the hearing aids.  In order to power them off, you open the battery tray.  I would be nice to have a switch to turn them off.  The problem I ran into with this is that when I pick them up in the mornings, one of the batteries would fall out of the tray.  Not that big of a deal, but as the size 312 batteries are small, I found myself hunting for a dropped battery.

Sound quality

Sound quality is nothing short of amazing.  These are so much better than my previous hearing aids.  I still have the ones I was previously using from a different manufacturer, but I will not be going back to those and will only use these now.  It took me two days to get used to these, but Lexie says to give it two weeks.  After two days, I didn’t notice the electronic enhanced sound as being that.  With my previous hearing aids, it was always noticeable, but not with the Lexie hearing aids.

App/features

Lexie has an app that you use to run a sound test so the app can setup an audio profile for you that works best for your hearing loss.  It took only a few minutes to get through the test.  Once that is done, you can adjust the volume and set different profiles based on your environment.  Currently there are six profiles.  The profiles can be selected with the push of a button on the hearing aids if you need to change profiles but don’t want to do it through your mobile device.  The app will also show you a power indicator for each hearing aid as well as get remote expert support.

I’m pleased with what Lexie has here.  I’ve tried several brands in the past and the Lexie hearing aids, by far, exceed all of the hearing aids that I’ve tried over the years.  I don’t think anyone will go wrong with these.  I can’t recommend them enough.  Well done Lexie!"
10,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Great Tech. The App Makes Them Easy To Setup,"Great Tech in these and the App makes getting them fine-tuned a breeze.  These use standard zinc-air hearing aid batteries, if somebody already has a traditional (before over the counter OTC options became available) they are already use to these types of batteries.  The batteries last about 5 to 8 days as long as you crack open the battery holder when they are not in use.  My wife had no problems installing the Lexie app and getting these setup with the easy to use hearing setup session.  The 2nd morning, the app was not responsive, and upon restarting it, it would not get past the ""programming hearing aids"" step.  Called the number that came up on the App under HELP, and had a live person helping us in literally less than a minute.  They were super helpful running through things to try in order, we had to delete the data on the app and redo the hearing setup session from scratch, but they have worked flawlessly since then.  The sound help from these after setup is exceptional.  The detail that can be picked up by those with hearing loss will vary, but my wife has reported that the everyday mode helps a lot, but the noisy indoors mode makes a big difference when music, multiple voices, sounds of multiple people moving and doing things in the kitchen.  They can hear me clearly around corners now without me raising my voice, and they were able to track me by sound all around the top floor of our house.  Just the little things like they were able to hear the raindrops hitting super clearly when the front door was opened while being all the way across the living room.  The app makes using these super easy, so you don't have to fiddle with the controls on the hearing aids themselves.  Select sound modes, adjust volume levels, check your hearing profile.  I wholeheartedly suggest these for those trying the new Over the Counter (OTC) approach to hearing aids."
10,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,A Great Pair Of Hearing Aids!,"When I first received the Lexie Lumen OTC hearing aids, I could not get them to pair with the Lexie Application. I received a second set after calling Lexie's customer service department and these paired right out of the box with no issues.

The Lexie hearing aids, powered by Bose, sit snugly behind your ears and connect to your inner ears via a clear plastic cable that is almost invisible. The hearing aid bodies are hardly seen due to their small footprint and high mounting abehind your ears. The color of the Lexie hearing aides I have is gray and blend in with my hair color nicely. The in-ear cords can hardly be seen, are quite small and go into your ear and out of sight.

The Lexie App was easy to download and install on my iPhone. The application allows you to control the volume and sound quality (treble and bass) and is very well thought out. Settings include adjusting between treble and bass, sound balance between ears, sound directionality - front only or from everywhere - and environments - noisy indoor, outdoors, music and everyday.

The Lexie Lumen OTC B-1 Hearing Aids powered by Bose are a very good investment and work very well in helping you hear in most any environment."
10,BestBuy,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,There are better choices out there,"The first thing you may notice about the Lexi Lumen, particularly if they aren't your first hearing aids, is that they are relatively large. They are larger than my previous professional model, and significantly larger than my current professional aid, both of which are over-the-ear types like the Lumen. Still, they are very lightweight and comfortable, so it really depends on how noticeable they are on you and whether having a visible hearing aid bothers you. They run off of a standard hearing aid battery size 312. These last about a week, and the Lumen comes packaged with several packs of batteries. 

Fitting the hearing aid involves using a cardboard sizer to select the correct length of tubing and then choosing the earpiece that works the best for you. A wide selection of both is included in the package. Setup then continues through the app.

I have hearing loss in one ear (unilateral). The Lexi app correctly identified that anyone with unilateral hearing loss should be examined by a physician to see if there is an underlying issue that needs to be addressed, which not all OTC tests do. Like other OTC hearing aids, the Lexi app administers a hearing test. While selecting a quiet environment is critical, the Lexi app does not tell you if your current environment is quiet enough. Unlike the other apps I have tried, sequential tests conducted in the same quiet environment showed significantly different hearing profiles. Sometimes it showed me having diminished mid-range hearing, but normal high and low end, which is exactly the opposite of what a professional test and tests from Jabra and Sony OTC aids showed. Once it showed me with completely normal hearing in both ears. It usually showed me with relatively normal high-end hearing, which I can guarantee is not correct. The app stores your most recent profiles and you can revert to any one of them, including selecting a different profile for each ear. This is handy, but would be even handier if it showed you what the profile looked like rather than just the date and time it was created.

Once you’ve set up the Lumen, you can select from six different environment modes, including using a companion mic or a telecoil. “Music” was actually the most natural sound for me, but it also amplified a lot of background noises that natural hearing (and other hearing aids I've used) don't amplify. I ended up setting them on “Everyday” to block the background noise, accepting some reduced naturalness to the sound.

As far as sound clarity, the Lexi Lumen was quite good, but for me it had a rather unusual glitch that I still haven’t been able to resolve, even with help from Lexi’s support line. When a sudden noise occurs (think of a book opening, a microwave oven alarm, or a knock at the door) the Lumen initially mutes the sound before bringing it up to a normal volume. While only about half a second, it is very distracting. Since I only wear one hearing aid, sounds initially appeared to be coming from the unaided side until the Lexi caught up. Changing the environment to “Music” improved this, but this mode amplifies a lot of frequencies that could best be described as background static - perfect for picking up the nuances in music, not so good for walking around. I have been working with Lexi support to find out why this is happening, but so far we have no resolution. The support team’s approach is to have you try a different setting / earpiece and live with it a few days, at which point they’ll call you back. Well, actually, you end up having to call them back, as I have yet to have them actually make the promised follow-on call. If we get this issue corrected, it would significantly change my impression of these. I will post an updated review should that happen.

If you have hearing loss, any hearing aid will change your life, and in that respect the Lexi Lumen may deliver what you need. Overall, though, there are better choices out there."
10,BestBuy,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,very comfortable,"So far, I have been enjoying these hearing aids.  But I have noticed a few things and why I am giving them a 3-star rating.  I have pretty bad hearing loss in my left ear and right ear.  Left ear more so.  I can tell these are on in the right ear easy as I get static when I adjust or touch the right hearing aid.  My left ear though, I don't get that static and I only can tell it's on because in the app I can have it beep in whatever hearing aid.  I also feel like the left ear is much lower sounding.  I am assuming this is due to having worse hearing loss in my left ear and so its maxed out.  Sad if this is the case as I have used others that seem to get louder.  I also noticed that on my right ear, if I adjust the volume past 6 or so, it starts to get static/distorted.  Same when you might turn on an audio device and turn it up too loud for what the speakers can handle.  

The app, to set up, it has you go thru a hearing test.  This is normal and I don't mind that.  However, instead of short beeps, it would just do a single long beep.  I prefer the short beeps.  Would be nice to have that as an option.  It would also be nice if you could input your own hearing loss diagram.  Or customize it.  

Batteries, why now a days they did not go with rechargeables I don't know.  Would be nice if they could have made it so you could place in the case and have the case charge.  That said, these do last about a week of normal wear.  That brings up another issue, to turn these off, you have to open the battery compartment.  I would have liked to see this future in the app so that I could turn off easily while keeping in my ear.  there are times I want to briefly turn off but don't want to have to take them out.  

These are also partial Bluetooth from what you might expect when you hear they are Bluetooth.  That being that they connect to your phone via Bluetooth.  However, you can't listen to music, videos etc.  you can only control them via the app.  

Now for comfort.  This is one reason why I am giving this a 3 star instead of a 2.  These are my favorite hearing aid style.  I like that they go behind the ear and then a tube inside the ear canal.  I have used these all day and not have them fall out.  My left ear were earbuds usually sit at has a lump.  So, it causes most hearing buds to fall out as they don't go in as far because of this.  With these, because they don't rely on sitting in the ear, I had no issues with them coming out.  I also in a way like this style because it lets everyone around me know that I do have a hearing loss.  This isn't something to be ashamed of.  This also seems too not have anyone question if I have ear buds in.  

Like I mentioned, with these I would have liked to see rechargeable batteries, and a way for them to be able to allow you to listen to your device at the same time.  And better speaker for them for those with more severe hearing loss.  They have a Bose one that is a little more expensive, but I believe those are like I mentioned above, that sit in your ear.  I like this style (or ones that are straight that just go into the ear canal)."
10,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Great Choice If You Have Need,"Lexie Hearing - Lexie Lumen OTC Hearing Aids: An excellent choice if you need them.

So my dad is living with us for a year or so after losing my mom unexpectedly. The wife and I {along with my brother and other family members) have noted for YEARS that his hearing has been getting progressively worse. After living with us for as long as he had, it was blatantly obvious to EVERYONE that his hearing was rapidly depleteing.

Unfortunately, he continually denied it. Even though both of his brothers and 2 of 3 of nephews have worn hearing aids for years, he simply denied it.

Well, we finally had the difficult conversation and he agreed that we were probably right... When I gave him the chance to look over these and read the Best Buy tech spec's he agreed to try them out. I can tell you, he is glad he did!

He is much more connected in coversations, more aware of things happening around him AND he has turned the TV volume down significantly.

After downloading the app, set up was pretty easy. We had him going in a fairly short time. The app was easy to use and laid out very well. As for comfort, he has worn them for hours at a time and had no complaints, at least after a couple days to ""burn them in"". He has used them in multipe social settings, while driving, at a Colorado Avalanche game, skiing. All with no problems.

These are a high-end medical device and I would whole-heartedly reccomend them to a friend!"
10,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Affordable Option For Average Hearing Problems,"BOX:   In the box you will get the hearing aids in a case, extra batteries, a user manual, quick start guide, alternate tubes, different sized tips, measuring tool, drying capsules, cleaning wire and a tool to clean your hearing aids.  These come in a nice, compact, convenient case, kind of like what you would keep ear buds in.

ASSEMBLY:   I was able to put the batteries in (at the bottom of each hearing aid), chose my tube length for around the ear and get these set up pretty quickly.   It is simple to change the tube length after using the measuring tool.  They unplug and plug in with ease.  The tubes are even labeled left and right to make it easy for you.

CONTROLS:   The hearing aids themselves have buttons to help control your hearing.  Each hearing aid has these buttons.  The top button is a program button, which helps change the settings for regular and background programs, along with 2 other options.  There is also volume up and down.

LEXIE APP & SETUP:   If you find, like I do, that the buttons are not easy to control, these hearing aids are designed to work with the Lexie App.  The aids are connected to your phone via Bluetooth.  Just because these are connected to your phone through Bluetooth does not mean you can stream music with them.  They weren’t designed for that.  The app walks you through the set up process by answering some questions and even does a hearing check to help with the programming to help you hear better.

PERSONAL RESULTS:  I have found that I can hear much better while watching television at a lower volume, which my family loves.  I can now hear conversations while in a crowded environment, such as parties, restaurants, etc. This was one of my biggest obstacles.  I was nodding my head (because my mouth reading wasn’t always accurate) and I have had some pretty embarrassing moments.  So glad that won’t be happening again, since I can hear so much better in 
these types of environment.  

SUPPORT:   If you have questions, the support team is excellent in helping you to get these working right for you.

For the price of these, you are getting updated hearing aids for less than getting them through a doctor.  If you are on a budget and can’t get hearing aids through your insurance, these are a reasonably priced option."
10,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Great alternative to prescription hearing aids!,"I got these as a gift for my father-in-law who has tried both in-ear, and over-the-ear hearing aids.  Overall, he likes them, and they are comfortable.

They have replaceable batteries which is a plus as you don't have to recharge them on a daily basis. So far, battery life is good and additional batteries are included. Batteries are also available at just about every retailer and online.

The retention wire does a good job of keeping the hearing aids in place. The volume control works well and the environment control button does a good job with background noise.

Unfortunately, there's no on/off switch so you have to remove the batteries to turn them off. Although this preserves battery life, the downside is the hole for the batteries is very small. An older person and/or someone with unsteady hands might have a difficult time replacing the batteries.

The app was easy to install and the hearing test allows you to tailor the aids for your specific needs.

Unfortunately, they are little bit large and noticeable so if you're someone who is self-conscious about hearing aids, the in-ear type might be preferable.

However, the biggest advantage to these is the price! No need to spend thousands of dollars or take multiple trips to the audiologist for custom hearing aids.  

These do a great job and get five stars for sure!"
10,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Great affordable OTC hearing aids!,"These hearing aids are very nice compared to the much higher priced aids. They have a 45 day money-back guarantee. You don't need an appointment to get them as they are FDA-regulated. They have replaceable batteries. They are sweatproof and have noise reduction and feedback cancellation. There is an app where the user can have more control including the adjustable volume.  You are able to use FSA and HSA dollars to pay. Out of the box they are very easy to fit and use. The app has a hearing check so it can be setup just for your hearing. What I liked is the hearing aids have directional hearing so you know where the sound is coming from. Some aids don't have that and you have to try and figure out where the sound came from. The lexie has a subscription where if you pay the monthly cost you get a care kit that will send you batteries as well as accessories. What was also nice about the app is you can choose what hearing environment you are in. It has every day use, noisy indoor, music, outdoor, telecoil or companion mic. If you are looking for a reasonably priced hearing aids these should be on your list."
10,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,"One year check in,  Unit works support outstanding","product is iffy that no seniors like to use it and I don't have a hearing problem I was hoping for a lot more/

Most important feature is customer service,l By all means this company is aggressive and desire satisfaction from its clients which is notable and appreciated.

Because hearing aids are excessively expensive a reasonably intelligent person who has smartphone experience with small buttons and patients can make excellent use of this product

However maintenance and comfort are very questionable, The unit has sticking wire Straps hanging out of the year, Easily perishable Plastic extenders into the ear

And its tiny button control system located on the device is a nuisance for most aged people who also use their smartphones at best for just making phone calls not adjusting features

With its support structure and it's still functionality after a year it has some very good positives.  Support is very important for such devices and they do have a good support team they literally check up on the User's product to lend a hand

Again I will keep my eye open on this company as they Address these issues I am sure that they will make an application that is easy for seniors to use to control the hearing aid and that less interaction with Small buttons and replacement parts will be made.

I strongly think they should probably ask Bose for their noise cancelation technology an earbud design which is more user friendly and adds a feature that helps greatly with senior hearing

But that would best be a good suggestion that probably will not happen"

10,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Hearing aids half the size and fraction of cost,"Hearing aids have come a long way size, technology, and affordability wise. Compared to  similar hearing aids that my grandmother has used, these Lexie Lumen OTC hearing aids are almost half the size of normal hearing aids, a fraction of the cost, and easy to setup and use with bluetooth technology and the use of their app to go through the process and take the hearing check to really have these work best for your specific hearing deficits. With sizing and going through setup you're up and running. 

The buttons are small enough to not be bulky but at the same time raised enough to function easily at the touch of your finger.  There Adaptive Noise Reduction helps to differentiate between 
sounds which are more speech-like or more noise-like. They include multiple tip sizes so you're set for pretty much any size ear whether it small, medium, or large. It comes with a nice carrying case as well.

I have recently had issues with fluid build up in my ear and slightly diminished hearing. I've been having to pop my ears to get the sound back.  My ENT doctor has said I may need a procedure to fix this but in the mean time these have definitely been a blessing in disguise. It can be extremely frustrating when you're asking someone to repeat what they've said or you aren't able to comprehend due to mild hearing loss. I would definitely recommend these to others"
10,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Tears of happiness,"For some context on the user, I had my 80 year old grandmother use these hearing aids because whenever any of us in the family talk to her, she says that we are mumbling and she can't understand what we're saying, blaming us as the reason for her not being able to hear us well.

My grandmother and my grandfather always have the television volume up to near the max that whenever we visit their house it's hard to hear and we need to lower the volume.

After gifting these to my grandmother (I wish I had a second pair for my grandfather), there was no noticeable difference immediately which is normal. In addition she didn't want to believe that her hearing was the issue.

After about a week, it seemed so subtle, but it was great news in a funny way. She said we're now too loud! Which we were happy to hear. She can definitely hear much better.

Wanted to share this review in a story-like format of how it has helped our family grow closer. Simply put, they work. Give them a shot. It's worth it."

My wife had no problems installing the Lexie app and getting these setup with the easy to use hearing setup session.  The 2nd morning, the app was not responsive, and upon restarting it, it would not get past the ""programming hearing aids"" step.  Called the number that came up on the App under HELP, and had a live person helping us in literally less than a minute.  They were super helpful running through things to try in order, we had to delete the data on the app and redo the hearing setup session from scratch, but they have worked flawlessly since then.  The sound help from these after setup is exceptional.  The detail that can be picked up by those with hearing loss will vary, but my wife has reported that the everyday mode helps a lot, but the noisy indoors mode makes a big difference when music, multiple voices, sounds of multiple people moving and doing things in the kitchen.  They can hear me clearly around corners now without me raising my voice, and they were able to track me by sound all around the top floor of our house.  Just the little things like they were able to hear the raindrops hitting super clearly when the front door was opened while being all the way across the living room.  The app makes using these super easy, so you don't have to fiddle with the controls on the hearing aids themselves.  Select sound modes, adjust volume levels, check your hearing profile.  I wholeheartedly suggest these for those trying the new Over the Counter (OTC) approach to hearing aids."
10,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,A Great Pair Of Hearing Aids!,"When I first received the Lexie Lumen OTC hearing aids, I could not get them to pair with the Lexie Application. I received a second set after calling Lexie's customer service department and these paired right out of the box with no issues.

The Lexie hearing aids, powered by Bose, sit snugly behind your ears and connect to your inner ears via a clear plastic cable that is almost invisible. The hearing aid bodies are hardly seen due to their small footprint and high mounting abehind your ears. The color of the Lexie hearing aides I have is gray and blend in with my hair color nicely. The in-ear cords can hardly be seen, are quite small and go into your ear and out of sight.

The Lexie App was easy to download and install on my iPhone. The application allows you to control the volume and sound quality (treble and bass) and is very well thought out. Settings include adjusting between treble and bass, sound balance between ears, sound directionality - front only or from everywhere - and environments - noisy indoor, outdoors, music and everyday.

The Lexie Lumen OTC B-1 Hearing Aids powered by Bose are a very good investment and work very well in helping you hear in most any environment."
10,BestBuy,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,There are better choices out there,"The first thing you may notice about the Lexi Lumen, particularly if they aren't your first hearing aids, is that they are relatively large. They are larger than my previous professional model, and significantly larger than my current professional aid, both of which are over-the-ear types like the Lumen. Still, they are very lightweight and comfortable, so it really depends on how noticeable they are on you and whether having a visible hearing aid bothers you. They run off of a standard hearing aid battery size 312. These last about a week, and the Lumen comes packaged with several packs of batteries. 

Fitting the hearing aid involves using a cardboard sizer to select the correct length of tubing and then choosing the earpiece that works the best for you. A wide selection of both is included in the package. Setup then continues through the app.

I have hearing loss in one ear (unilateral). The Lexi app correctly identified that anyone with unilateral hearing loss should be examined by a physician to see if there is an underlying issue that needs to be addressed, which not all OTC tests do. Like other OTC hearing aids, the Lexi app administers a hearing test. While selecting a quiet environment is critical, the Lexi app does not tell you if your current environment is quiet enough. Unlike the other apps I have tried, sequential tests conducted in the same quiet environment showed significantly different hearing profiles. Sometimes it showed me having diminished mid-range hearing, but normal high and low end, which is exactly the opposite of what a professional test and tests from Jabra and Sony OTC aids showed. Once it showed me with completely normal hearing in both ears. It usually showed me with relatively normal high-end hearing, which I can guarantee is not correct. The app stores your most recent profiles and you can revert to any one of them, including selecting a different profile for each ear. This is handy, but would be even handier if it showed you what the profile looked like rather than just the date and time it was created.

Once you’ve set up the Lumen, you can select from six different environment modes, including using a companion mic or a telecoil. “Music” was actually the most natural sound for me, but it also amplified a lot of background noises that natural hearing (and other hearing aids I've used) don't amplify. I ended up setting them on “Everyday” to block the background noise, accepting some reduced naturalness to the sound.

As far as sound clarity, the Lexi Lumen was quite good, but for me it had a rather unusual glitch that I still haven’t been able to resolve, even with help from Lexi’s support line. When a sudden noise occurs (think of a book opening, a microwave oven alarm, or a knock at the door) the Lumen initially mutes the sound before bringing it up to a normal volume. While only about half a second, it is very distracting. Since I only wear one hearing aid, sounds initially appeared to be coming from the unaided side until the Lexi caught up. Changing the environment to “Music” improved this, but this mode amplifies a lot of frequencies that could best be described as background static - perfect for picking up the nuances in music, not so good for walking around. I have been working with Lexi support to find out why this is happening, but so far we have no resolution. The support team’s approach is to have you try a different setting / earpiece and live with it a few days, at which point they’ll call you back. Well, actually, you end up having to call them back, as I have yet to have them actually make the promised follow-on call. If we get this issue corrected, it would significantly change my impression of these. I will post an updated review should that happen.

If you have hearing loss, any hearing aid will change your life, and in that respect the Lexi Lumen may deliver what you need. Overall, though, there are better choices out there."
10,BestBuy,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,very comfortable,"So far, I have been enjoying these hearing aids.  But I have noticed a few things and why I am giving them a 3-star rating.  I have pretty bad hearing loss in my left ear and right ear.  Left ear more so.  I can tell these are on in the right ear easy as I get static when I adjust or touch the right hearing aid.  My left ear though, I don't get that static and I only can tell it's on because in the app I can have it beep in whatever hearing aid.  I also feel like the left ear is much lower sounding.  I am assuming this is due to having worse hearing loss in my left ear and so its maxed out.  Sad if this is the case as I have used others that seem to get louder.  I also noticed that on my right ear, if I adjust the volume past 6 or so, it starts to get static/distorted.  Same when you might turn on an audio device and turn it up too loud for what the speakers can handle.  

The app, to set up, it has you go thru a hearing test.  This is normal and I don't mind that.  However, instead of short beeps, it would just do a single long beep.  I prefer the short beeps.  Would be nice to have that as an option.  It would also be nice if you could input your own hearing loss diagram.  Or customize it.  

Batteries, why now a days they did not go with rechargeables I don't know.  Would be nice if they could have made it so you could place in the case and have the case charge.  That said, these do last about a week of normal wear.  That brings up another issue, to turn these off, you have to open the battery compartment.  I would have liked to see this future in the app so that I could turn off easily while keeping in my ear.  there are times I want to briefly turn off but don't want to have to take them out.  

These are also partial Bluetooth from what you might expect when you hear they are Bluetooth.  That being that they connect to your phone via Bluetooth.  However, you can't listen to music, videos etc.  you can only control them via the app.  

Now for comfort.  This is one reason why I am giving this a 3 star instead of a 2.  These are my favorite hearing aid style.  I like that they go behind the ear and then a tube inside the ear canal.  I have used these all day and not have them fall out.  My left ear were earbuds usually sit at has a lump.  So, it causes most hearing buds to fall out as they don't go in as far because of this.  With these, because they don't rely on sitting in the ear, I had no issues with them coming out.  I also in a way like this style because it lets everyone around me know that I do have a hearing loss.  This isn't something to be ashamed of.  This also seems too not have anyone question if I have ear buds in.  

Like I mentioned, with these I would have liked to see rechargeable batteries, and a way for them to be able to allow you to listen to your device at the same time.  And better speaker for them for those with more severe hearing loss.  They have a Bose one that is a little more expensive, but I believe those are like I mentioned above, that sit in your ear.  I like this style (or ones that are straight that just go into the ear canal)."
10,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Great Choice If You Have Need,"Lexie Hearing - Lexie Lumen OTC Hearing Aids: An excellent choice if you need them.

So my dad is living with us for a year or so after losing my mom unexpectedly. The wife and I {along with my brother and other family members) have noted for YEARS that his hearing has been getting progressively worse. After living with us for as long as he had, it was blatantly obvious to EVERYONE that his hearing was rapidly depleteing.

Unfortunately, he continually denied it. Even though both of his brothers and 2 of 3 of nephews have worn hearing aids for years, he simply denied it.

Well, we finally had the difficult conversation and he agreed that we were probably right... When I gave him the chance to look over these and read the Best Buy tech spec's he agreed to try them out. I can tell you, he is glad he did!

He is much more connected in coversations, more aware of things happening around him AND he has turned the TV volume down significantly.

After downloading the app, set up was pretty easy. We had him going in a fairly short time. The app was easy to use and laid out very well. As for comfort, he has worn them for hours at a time and had no complaints, at least after a couple days to ""burn them in"". He has used them in multipe social settings, while driving, at a Colorado Avalanche game, skiing. All with no problems.

These are a high-end medical device and I would whole-heartedly reccomend them to a friend!"
10,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Affordable Option For Average Hearing Problems,"BOX:   In the box you will get the hearing aids in a case, extra batteries, a user manual, quick start guide, alternate tubes, different sized tips, measuring tool, drying capsules, cleaning wire and a tool to clean your hearing aids.  These come in a nice, compact, convenient case, kind of like what you would keep ear buds in.

ASSEMBLY:   I was able to put the batteries in (at the bottom of each hearing aid), chose my tube length for around the ear and get these set up pretty quickly.   It is simple to change the tube length after using the measuring tool.  They unplug and plug in with ease.  The tubes are even labeled left and right to make it easy for you.

CONTROLS:   The hearing aids themselves have buttons to help control your hearing.  Each hearing aid has these buttons.  The top button is a program button, which helps change the settings for regular and background programs, along with 2 other options.  There is also volume up and down.

LEXIE APP & SETUP:   If you find, like I do, that the buttons are not easy to control, these hearing aids are designed to work with the Lexie App.  The aids are connected to your phone via Bluetooth.  Just because these are connected to your phone through Bluetooth does not mean you can stream music with them.  They weren’t designed for that.  The app walks you through the set up process by answering some questions and even does a hearing check to help with the programming to help you hear better.

PERSONAL RESULTS:  I have found that I can hear much better while watching television at a lower volume, which my family loves.  I can now hear conversations while in a crowded environment, such as parties, restaurants, etc. This was one of my biggest obstacles.  I was nodding my head (because my mouth reading wasn’t always accurate) and I have had some pretty embarrassing moments.  So glad that won’t be happening again, since I can hear so much better in 
these types of environment.  

SUPPORT:   If you have questions, the support team is excellent in helping you to get these working right for you.

For the price of these, you are getting updated hearing aids for less than getting them through a doctor.  If you are on a budget and can’t get hearing aids through your insurance, these are a reasonably priced option."
10,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Great alternative to prescription hearing aids!,"I got these as a gift for my father-in-law who has tried both in-ear, and over-the-ear hearing aids.  Overall, he likes them, and they are comfortable.

They have replaceable batteries which is a plus as you don't have to recharge them on a daily basis. So far, battery life is good and additional batteries are included. Batteries are also available at just about every retailer and online.

The retention wire does a good job of keeping the hearing aids in place. The volume control works well and the environment control button does a good job with background noise.

Unfortunately, there's no on/off switch so you have to remove the batteries to turn them off. Although this preserves battery life, the downside is the hole for the batteries is very small. An older person and/or someone with unsteady hands might have a difficult time replacing the batteries.

The app was easy to install and the hearing test allows you to tailor the aids for your specific needs.

Unfortunately, they are little bit large and noticeable so if you're someone who is self-conscious about hearing aids, the in-ear type might be preferable.

However, the biggest advantage to these is the price! No need to spend thousands of dollars or take multiple trips to the audiologist for custom hearing aids.  

These do a great job and get five stars for sure!"
10,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Great affordable OTC hearing aids!,"These hearing aids are very nice compared to the much higher priced aids. They have a 45 day money-back guarantee. You don't need an appointment to get them as they are FDA-regulated. They have replaceable batteries. They are sweatproof and have noise reduction and feedback cancellation. There is an app where the user can have more control including the adjustable volume.  You are able to use FSA and HSA dollars to pay. Out of the box they are very easy to fit and use. The app has a hearing check so it can be setup just for your hearing. What I liked is the hearing aids have directional hearing so you know where the sound is coming from. Some aids don't have that and you have to try and figure out where the sound came from. The lexie has a subscription where if you pay the monthly cost you get a care kit that will send you batteries as well as accessories. What was also nice about the app is you can choose what hearing environment you are in. It has every day use, noisy indoor, music, outdoor, telecoil or companion mic. If you are looking for a reasonably priced hearing aids these should be on your list."
10,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,"One year check in,  Unit works support outstanding","product is iffy that no seniors like to use it and I don't have a hearing problem I was hoping for a lot more/

Most important feature is customer service,l By all means this company is aggressive and desire satisfaction from its clients which is notable and appreciated.

Because hearing aids are excessively expensive a reasonably intelligent person who has smartphone experience with small buttons and patients can make excellent use of this product

However maintenance and comfort are very questionable, The unit has sticking wire Straps hanging out of the year, Easily perishable Plastic extenders into the ear

And its tiny button control system located on the device is a nuisance for most aged people who also use their smartphones at best for just making phone calls not adjusting features

With its support structure and it's still functionality after a year it has some very good positives.  Support is very important for such devices and they do have a good support team they literally check up on the User's product to lend a hand

Again I will keep my eye open on this company as they Address these issues I am sure that they will make an application that is easy for seniors to use to control the hearing aid and that less interaction with Small buttons and replacement parts will be made.

I strongly think they should probably ask Bose for their noise cancelation technology an earbud design which is more user friendly and adds a feature that helps greatly with senior hearing

But that would best be a good suggestion that probably will not happen"
10,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Works well with iPhone,Very happy with my purchase of Lexie Lumen. I got the light grey model which looks great and is very discrete. Setting up from my iPhone was easy and it works well with different environment settings. This works better and is more comfortable than my last hearing aid that cost me over $2500.
10,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Hearing aids half the size and fraction of cost,"Hearing aids have come a long way size, technology, and affordability wise. Compared to  similar hearing aids that my grandmother has used, these Lexie Lumen OTC hearing aids are almost half the size of normal hearing aids, a fraction of the cost, and easy to setup and use with bluetooth technology and the use of their app to go through the process and take the hearing check to really have these work best for your specific hearing deficits. With sizing and going through setup you're up and running. 

The buttons are small enough to not be bulky but at the same time raised enough to function easily at the touch of your finger.  There Adaptive Noise Reduction helps to differentiate between 
sounds which are more speech-like or more noise-like. They include multiple tip sizes so you're set for pretty much any size ear whether it small, medium, or large. It comes with a nice carrying case as well.

I have recently had issues with fluid build up in my ear and slightly diminished hearing. I've been having to pop my ears to get the sound back.  My ENT doctor has said I may need a procedure to fix this but in the mean time these have definitely been a blessing in disguise. It can be extremely frustrating when you're asking someone to repeat what they've said or you aren't able to comprehend due to mild hearing loss. I would definitely recommend these to others"
10,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Tears of happiness,"For some context on the user, I had my 80 year old grandmother use these hearing aids because whenever any of us in the family talk to her, she says that we are mumbling and she can't understand what we're saying, blaming us as the reason for her not being able to hear us well.

My grandmother and my grandfather always have the television volume up to near the max that whenever we visit their house it's hard to hear and we need to lower the volume.

After gifting these to my grandmother (I wish I had a second pair for my grandfather), there was no noticeable difference immediately which is normal. In addition she didn't want to believe that her hearing was the issue.

After about a week, it seemed so subtle, but it was great news in a funny way. She said we're now too loud! Which we were happy to hear. She can definitely hear much better.

Wanted to share this review in a story-like format of how it has helped our family grow closer. Simply put, they work. Give them a shot. It's worth it."

Had bought two different OTC hearing aids from different companies and the wouldn't hold a charge (there were supposedly rechargeable). These are battery operated and batteries have last 8+ days.

10,BestBuy,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,Not Rechargeable!,At this price point I was unpleasantly surprised to find that the batteries are not rechargeable. You have to go deep into the specs to find this out. I would not recommend this unit.
10,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"Just what the Doctor ordered, yet **affordable**","Not knowing for certain I needed hearing aids a few years, yet after multiple family members joked about my hearing I decided to go to an audiologist, who confirmed much of my higher frequency hearing has been impacted.  

They recommended a $7,500 set of L/R hearing aids, not covered by insurance and too steep for out-of-pocket.  Seeing there are now a couple of players entering the OTC category I was tempted.  Originally thought the Apple AirPods would suffice (and they often do) but sometimes feels disrespectful if others don’t know I’m using them as low-cost aids.

The Lexie Lumen I have to admit I’m very impressed with.  It was a little more involved trying to figure out the batteries, tubes, cups and sizing charts.  Fortunately the Lexie app conveniently and simply walks you though the entire process, and culminates in a series of tones played out at different frequencies and volumes for a seemingly detailed and accurate hearing test. 

While not perfect, there are a few improvements I’ll suggest in the cons section, but for the most part, being able to hear movie dialog and pay attention to the actors instead of reading lips and closed captions makes the world more sonically enjoyable for me. 


Pros
+ build quality
+ compact size
+ premium packaging
+ App steals the show, invaluable 
+ includes 24 Rayovac Xcell 312 batteries 
+ battery life is better than expected 
+ accessories, tips, cups, tubes, storage and cleaning cases 

Cons
-Can’t use AirPods with them
-Doesn’t receive music over bluetooth (yet??) 
-Music Environment setting makes hissing sound 

Conclusion 
*After experiencing some level of hearing loss in my mid 40s (not surprising after a few hundred rock concerts) it seems to have progressed into my 50s.  I’d grown accustomed to using closed captions while also boosting the center channel for dialog enhancement. 

Previous to the OTC hearing aid category I refused to spend over $5k since I’ve been able to get by for the most part, but now that OTC are available in the sub $1k segment, if you have any loss at all, the barrier to entry is much less what it previously was.  With the category now accessible for mild to moderate loss I’m a buyer.

10,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Not so hard to hear anymore,"I have real bad tendonitis in both ears, I am a veteran and I had a lot of bang and a lot of boom go off around me and my hearing has only deteriorated, in my opinion, over the last few years and they've been recommending hearing aids for years. Most recently I came across these little guys and I decided I would go ahead and give them a try and there is a lot to love here. First of all, the design and the look make them seem more like earbuds than hearing aids, and I'm a little bit of a self-conscious kind of a person. I don't like people knowing that I have a hearing problem. Feel like they treat you different. But the next thing to love is how fantastic these little guys are. I don't know if it's by design, but the app that comes with it just gives it that little more appeal that it's more headphones than hearing aids, the Bluetooth pairing is awesome and keeps everything in perspective. Perspective. It doesn't even feel weird to wear them all day and I clocked their total charge time of about 12 hours until I needed to charge them. I highly recommend these for younger fellows who might be a little self-conscious and don't want people to know their wearing hearing aids. Amazing! Sound and fun. Fantastic aesthetic design."
10,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,"Clear, easy to use hearing aids without the hassle","The Lexie Lumen Hearing Ads have made a huge difference to someone who didn't realize the extent of their hearing loss.  In the box are the hearing aids with RIC wires, charging case, batteries, charging plug and cable, various sizes/styles of silicon domes (4 sets), slim tubes (4 sets, various lengths), brush, measuring tool to find the correct tube size, quick start guide and user manual. 

Setup is straight forward based on  using an Android phone, to get started install the Lexie app from the play store.  First step is to make an account and provide basic user information, then the app walks through the setup process.  Next the app guides you through tube length determination, battery installation, and pairing to a Bluetooth device.   Once paired, and after placing the hearing aid domes in the ear, the app initiates a baseline hearing test, by responding via the app as tones are heard through the hearing aid. The app configures the hearing aids based on your level of hearing loss and setup is complete. 

The app is very user friendly, with a large font, easy to select options, and high contrast selector buttons.  From the app you can see battery status for each hearing aid, Lexie shop to purchase replacement items, user profile, default environment settings and volume adjustment. The environment settings are: everyday, noisy indoor, outdoor, music, telecoil, and companion mic (the mic can be purchased separately via the Lexie store).  In addition there are separate screens for ""my hearing aids"" to perform a hearing check, see results, see program history, manage hearing aids and get information such as the serial number. There is a section for rewards, however I cannot get this work, plus options for video call support, and help.   

It took a couple of tries to find the most comfortable ear domes, the first set I tried fit but made my ears itch, I went down one size and had no issues. It took a few days to get used to wearing them and I experienced some discomfort at first when wearing my glasses.  After a week of consistent use the discomfort has reduced and I can wear them all day comfortably. 

A few things to navigate for first time users, when using cell phones or headsets there is feedback, so I had to change the environment setting to Telecoil and that eliminated all feedback. Based on the hearing test, my hearing is just under normal for high pitched sounds, a bit lower for mid-range, and almost 1/4 down the graph from normal for low-pitched sounds.  When using the hearing aids in noisy environments I can now carry on a conversation and hear those close by much easier.  I've found a huge improvement in the sound level I watch TV at (according to my spouse), the ability to carry on a conversation while out in public, improved sound sharpness, and no longer require someone to be looking at me to know they are speaking to me.  Overall I think this is a great product, it saves me the hassle of doctor visits and allows me the flexibility to adjust hearing support based on environment and need."
10,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Fantastic Over the Counter Hearing Aids,"Lexie Lumen OTC Hearing Aids

I have been using hearing aids for a few decades now. I am no expert and do have a lot of experience with different varieties of hearing devices but I will say, first off, that I am very impressed with these hearing aids. 
There are different types of hearing aids and now a range of prices for them to fit most budgets.
I have tried in-the-ear aids, behind the ear models, high priced versions with testing by an audiologist for thousands of dollars. I like the in-the-ear for their size but the behind the ear is more practical.
The Lexie models I am writing about are behind the ear models. When the aids I arrived I was anxious to try them. Available and I think required is a decent app for the iPhone or the Android. After downloading the app and powering up the hearing aids, the app runs some sequences to test my hearing ability in both ears. Once the test is complete, the aids are configured for my hearing.
The app has the ability to control volume and hearing programs to suit the environment I am in. There are also buttons on the aid to control, as well.
In my opinion, the hearing aids will satisfy anyone who has mediocre hearing ability or less. In my opinion, I think they are fantastic and would recommend them to others."
10,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Great alternative to expensive prescribed ones!,"Proper hearing aids used to be really expensive but in 2022, there are now some more affordable options that fit well between using your wireless earbuds as ""hearing aids"" and using expensive, audiologist prescribed ones. 

The Lexie Lumens are one of the first entries into the OTC hearing aid space in 2022 and they are pretty good! The packaging reminds me of buying some nice tech - like TWS earphones.  Inside the box you'll get a nice case, plenty of batteries, a drying case, different tips/tubes, cleaning tool and sizing tool.

The first thing you'll want to do is download the Lexie app available on iOS or Android and simply follow the instructions.  You'll answer some questions, use the sizing tool to find the proper fit, and put the batteries in so you can do the hearing test.  The hearing test is a key part of making the Lumens work.  It will test both your ears with a wide range of low to high frequencies and you'll tap a button if you can hear it.  It made me realize that I had more lower-frequency hearing loss in one of my ears than I realized!  After completing the test, your aids will now be programmed to boost the sound levels appropriately.

I think they're pretty small and they seem to work very well.  They are very sensitive (reminds me of condenser mics on my computer) and can allow you to hear whispers from a room away. Remember to change the different sound profiles so you can save your hearing.  They are sensitive and can really amplify sound, so going to a suddenly loud environment can result in some discomfort, at minimum!

The app is nice and straightforward, allowing you to see change the Environment profile, adjust volume (individually or separate), get help (I heard they're great!), and check your battery life. There's a rewards program that will trade your ""engagement"" for ""points"" to spend in their store.  I didn't try this, but it seems like you could buy some supplies like more batteries or something.

Overall I think these are a great alternative to those who need real hearing aids, but have struggled to pay for audiologist prescribed ones. They are MUCH better than just trying to use your ""Airpods"" as a hearing aid. The fact that they can zero in on your hearing weaknesses and are pretty unobtrusive are a plus. 

Note - in the photo, they seem to be pretty visible, but my ears do stick outwards. Ears that are flatter along the head should effectively hide the ""body"" of the Lumen.

The only cons I can think of are:
--Initial set up may be difficult for those not ""phone-savvy""

--Initial set up (inserting in ear after inserting batteries to start hearing test) resulted in some high-pitched, loud feedback.  I could only proceed after cranking the volume buttons down.

--Non-rechargeable batteries. Replaceable, rechargeable battery modules would have been best, but these ""cheap"" disposables are OK and should provide decent battery life. They are small and I could see people dropping/mishandling these instead of getting them into the small trays where they belong. Also, one of the new batteries actually seemed low since the right hearing aid started saying ""low battery"" about 15 minutes after use!"
10,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Setup for your own personal hearing loss,"I'm overall very impressed with the hearing aids, apple app, and customer service!

The box that the hearing aids come in has a nice premium look and feel.  This doesn't feel or look like a cheap product.  In the box they provided a nice carrying case for the hearing aids when not in use.  They also provided lots of batteries, different adapters, cleaning brush, wax guard packs used to remove water from hearing aids, and cleaning wires.  This definitely felt like a complete kit to get you up and running with these hearing aids.  I really liked that they provided everything to get setup and provide the care for these hearing aids.

The hearing aids themselves are small and very light weight.  Each hearing aid has a volume rocker and a button to change listening environments.  I had a little trouble trying to adjust the volume while wearing them.  I have fat fingers and buttons a little small.  However, you can just open the app and make the adjustments.  

I did the sizing to make sure I got a proper fit into my ear.  Then I followed the instructions in the app to get them setup for my use.  I got a little frustrated with the app because the process is slow getting them setup.  I'm impatient and with this setup you need to just be patient as the process is necessary to get the hearing aids setup for your usage.  I realized this after it was all setup and really appreciated how well thought out the app was to make sure you have a good experience with the hearing aids.  After I got everything setup the hearing aids functioned very well, and I was able to hear things that I couldn't before.  The app adjusted the hearing aids for my specific hearing loss, which was why it took longer time to setup, but it's totally worth it.

These are very comfortable to wear and forgot at times I even had them in.  The different listening environments does make a difference and are worth playing around with.  I'm not sure how long battery life is as I'm still on the first set of batteries after a few hours of use.  They do provide a lot of batteries so you should be okay for a little while.

When setting up the app I did provide my phone number.  Today (a few days after receiving the hearing aids) I got a call from customer service.  I wasn't able to answer but they voicemail said to give them a call if I needed assistance with the hearing aids.  This was a nice touch in my eyes, they seemed to genuinely care and wanted to help if you are having issues.  In the app they also offer video call support, overall, really nice as they want to help. 

My overall experience with the hearing aids has been awesome.  If you are looking for hearing aids, I would recommend checking these out or at least the brand."
10,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Sound Enhancement,"Opening the box I was surprised by the premium packaging and all the accessories that came with it. It came with plenty of batteries. A small heavy-duty box that contains the Hearing Aids. Plenty of adjustment accessories for your fit and liking. the Hearing Aids comes with a simple setup and directions that are easy to follow. You do have to download the Lexie app. After that was downloaded I followed the simple and easy setup through the app. It helps you understand the setup, parts, and controls. After taking the hearing test it will adjust to your fit and needs. It took about 15 minutes to do this. 

The audio you receive will be based on your test results. The sound was clear and crisp. I noticed a difference with sounds that were further away. Being able to adjust the sound for different environments from the hearing aids themselves is what helped me. You will hear conversations clearly. Even the background sounds will have a slight amplification depending on your settings. I did have to turn my settings down from the setting offered to me. I did experience a small echo at the end of certain sounds. Yet, that may have been due to certain pitches and vibrations. It wasn't noticeable 99.999% of the time  I used the hearing aids. You can kind of notice the hearing aids if you look hard enough. Yet, they are small and may not be noticed at first glance. I do know the app also provides costumer service. In case you run into any problems. 

The only negatives would be you can't listen to music over the hearing aids when its paired with your phone. It has the app which is required to setup. So you need a device to install it. Also, since the app is required for setup that may turn some people off. Overall the sound enhancement has been great for my experience!"
10,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Great product,Excellent. Easy setup and they just simply work great. Didn’t realize how bad my hearing was until I put these in. Highly recommended
10,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Lexie Hearing Aids.,I received these hearing aids less than two weeks ago.  At present I am very happy with them.  Their support service is so helpful.
10,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"No rechargeable batteries, no problem","Great product for moderate hearing loss. I don't think the lack of disposable batteries is a deal breaker depending on your lifestyle. I don't wear my hearing aids at home. No Bluetooth steaming though, so keep that in mind."
10,BestBuy,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,Not for me.,I didn't like the quality overall. I ended up with the Jabra which had more adjustments for environment and a much better warranty.
10,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Looks comfortable and good,Had to return . Got for my mother who is very hard to hear. Wasn’t able to set up cause of her bad hearing
10,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Affordable Alternative,Ended up returning item due to my own error when ordering.  But it appeared premium quality and the price is very reasonable based on how much similar products run
10,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Great Hearing Aids,"Great hearing aids!!  Purchased them for tinnitus and some hearing loss and they work great.  Got them on sale and if you need hearing aids and are on a fixed income like me, I highly recommend them."
10,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Some improvements desired,"Lexie should provide a case to house the hearing aids with the desiccant. Also, the app should show the appropriate percentage of battery power remaining."
10,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Better than professional hearing aids!,"As the title says, these are better than much more expensive and professional hearing aids. They were easy to setup right out of the box, including setting the app via Bluetooth. There are 6 environments modes and so far all work great. When in a quiet room, Everyday Use works really great, but if you're in a really loud indoor space, the Noisy Indoor mode helps you filter out background noise so you can hear things more clearly, including conversations with those close to you. Music mode also helps enhance your listening experience when listening to any kind of music. 

The hearing aids do a good job of differentiating between speech and noises as well, further enhancing the experience. So far the battery life has been really great as week. They are also almost nearly invisible in your ears. Overall, I highly recommend these hearing aids and they are a strong contender against the more expensive professional versions. In closing, the companion app is a really easy to use and really enhances the overall experience."
10,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Worthy OTC Hearing Aid with Smart App!,"It Seems times have changed from 30 Years ago when my Grandfather used hearing aids.  They were larger than these and required hearing specialist who sold them and followed there use carefully.  The Hearing aids of that time were large, hummed allot and seemed awkward to use.

Lexie Lumen is one of the New over the Counter hearing aids which might make you wonder, Could they be as Good as the full category of hearing aid doctors and product developers?

Well IF you have a cell phone, a Bluetooth, and some time, that expertise is now at your fingertips.  Although this model comes with an ample set of batteries that last an average of 4-5 weeks, lexie also offers re-chargeable, I could not splurge for the latest and greatest but am okay with the ample batteries included with this model and the relative costs of buying new ones.

With the online test run from a cell phone you can calibrate the hearing aids to a precise analysis to optimize your hearing range, customer service is more than willing and able to lend a hand in all of its operations or you can just pop it into your ears and use 4 pre-set programs to optimize indoor, outdoor, group or person to person use w/o the need of a smart phone and app.

Right out of the package these hearing aids went right to work.  

A great Benefit is that it is small and not obtrusive; a loss is that it’s hard to press buttons manually to adjust volume and/or set programs.  From an 87 yr old perspective larger units with larger buttons may have been more welcome, from a diabetic poked and numb finger tips the same would apply.

Another great benefit is its rather extensive analysis of your hearing ranges with a very clever app, again the drawback to that is the older generation still using rotary phones or at best flip phone cannot take advantage of this, so you will need a middle aged geek or a smart phone savvy 12+ year old to guide the older generation into its use.

The third factor is professional Hearing Aid specialist, they may be %80 replaceable but knowledgeable ones can tell you that hearing loss for any duration leave gaps in comprehension, frequencies and background distractions which my mom has a number of these.

Had I bought these hearing aids exclusively for someone beginning to lose there hearing or myself with decent hearing they would have been a godsend but for the older generation a professional might be required with this and some other more invasive procedures to recover more advanced hearing loss

When you have a reasonable sized family growing old with hearing issues by no doubt I will find a home for this soon, already 3 people in the family with hearing issues see this as a reasonable tool."
10,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"Got them for my Dad, here’s his review:","My son got me the Lexie Lumen to evaluate. I have had moderate hearing loss for several years and was tested by my ENT last year. She advised me to get “amplification” but I was reluctant to do so on my own. 
The packaging of the device was professional. The box contained 24 batteries, cleaning tools, a measuring device, three sizes of slim tubes and 5 different pairs of domes to customize to individual preferences.
This was my first experience with hearing aids and I had a difficult time getting it assembled and fitted. The instruction booklet suggests getting help from another person and I recommend that. The first step, for example, is to measure your ear for the proper length of the slim tube that leads from the hearing aid to the dome that goes into the ear. Without help, I had to take pictures of the side of with head my cell phone to read the gauge on the cardboard fitting tool placed over my ears. The instructions were well written, but the drawings in the booklet would benefit from photographs instead of drawings. The animated graphics in the app were clearer, but I didn’t download it right away (a mistake). There are five sizes of silicone “domes” or ear buds that fit on the end of the slim tube, but I started using the skirted dome that came as the default. Again, I never used hearing aids before and was always uncomfortable with ear buds for listening to music, so this required some adjustment for me. 

Once I got the devices installed on both ears, there was a connectivity issue getting the phone to pair with the devices, but I restarted the program and was able to go through the check-in process and a hearing test on each ear that gave results on a graph compared to normal people. Each device has buttons to control the volume and an “environmental” button featuring 6 different scenarios (everyday, outdoors, indoor noisy, music, telecoil (to connect with a cell phone) and companion mic (which requires an add-on that I do not have). Controlling the volume and environment with the buttons on the device takes some practice, but the app is far superior and easier to use, allowing volume control of each ear separately or together as well as selecting the appropriate environmental setting. I controlled both ear volumes together because the hearing test did not reveal dramatically different capacities in each ear.
The devices are very inconspicuous and would be nearly invisible with longer hair styles as they sit high behind the ear. The thin, clear slim tube that loops over the ear and into the dome sitting in the ear canal is visible, but unless someone is looking for it, it is relatively unobtrusive. Once I got the hang of it, installing and removing became easier. After a couple of days of use I also switched to more a traditional dome that was more comfortable.
The amplification provided by the Lexie was immediately noticeable. My hearing loss had been worse at high pitches, so with the devices, I became aware of the sound of my shoes scraping the floor or other adventitious sounds. After a few adjustments to the volume, the effects were better controlled so the high pitched sounds were normalized. My family noticed the difference immediately. I said fewer “huhs?” and asks for repeats. The environmental control for “noisy indoors” is particularly helpful in restaurants or when TVs or fans are on. It seems to work by subduing high pitched background sounds or what I would call “din.” The “music” environmental setting is also a favorite as it really does make the sound of music more vivid.
In terms of storage when not in use, the booklet recommends opening the battery window and storing the device in an airtight container with one of the dessicant tablets provided (two came in the box). The instructions also advise cleaning the slim tube weekly by running the cleaning wire provided through the tube to remove any wax or debris.
I am pleased with the product. This is my first hearing aid, so I cannot compare it to other products. I note that a number of manufacturers, including Lexie, make rechargeable models, which would be a small added convenience at a higher price, but other than that, I cannot think of a feature that should be added to a device of this class."
10,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"Good instructions, nice app and affordable option","The Lexie Lumen OTC Hearing Aid offers a great alternative for those suffering hearing loss. Compared to the cost of traditional hearing aids these over-the-counter hearing aids cost significantly less and allow one to determine how disciplined the wearer will be in using these on a daily basis.

Lexie has done a good job in packaging the hearing aids and providing everything that one will need to get them set up and personalized. It’s nice that they include a quick start guide, along with a more detailed manual to answer any additional questions. We did not have to use their customer assistance, but it’s nice to know this is an easily accessible option if users require extra assistance.

Set up is straight forward, but one will need help to do the steps necessary to complete the hearing check via the app and physically fit the hearing aids for a custom fit. Some older wearers may need assistance with using the mobile app, but we found it to be straight forward, easy to read and easy to understand. It is understandable though that first time wearers of hearing aids may require help a few times from a second pair of eyes to ensure they have the hearing aids seated properly in their ear. After completing the steps with the sizing tool and installing the batteries we completed the fit in the ears and confirmed it was a comfortable fit for our family member. It didn’t take us too long to set the app up and run through the hearing test to assess how well various tone levels were picked up as the wearer confirmed when they could hear tones as we used the app to complete the hearing test. The app does a nice job of visually depicting how well one can hear various types of tones and it was quite evident for our family member that high pitched tones were their greatest type of hearing loss.

Lexie instructions mention that it takes about two weeks to adapt to using the hearing aids and it is best to make minimal changes to the settings until one can adapt and then assess if results are improved with changes in volume or environment settings. Also, it is important to note that there is maintenance involved with the hearing aids which will help prolong the life of the units also. When not in use, one should remove the batteries and place the hearing aids in a container with the drying capsules. There is also a brush and cleaning wire included to assist in keeping the hearing aids clean. It may take some practice for older family members to open the battery compartment and take care to not lose or drop the batteries as they are on the small side.

I think it is really nice that OTC hearing aids are now an option. The Lexie Lumen model offers a really nice price point compared to traditional hearing aids, but I would consider paying a bit more for the Lexie B2 model as it looks like these do not have the additional length of wire that extends beyond the dome point on the Lumen model. This added length of wire tucks inside the cove of the wearer’s ear, but it would be nice to not have that additional length of wire to bother with. Aside from this, the hearing aids are fairly small in size and designed to blend well to provide an inconspicuous solution to improving one’s hearing. Lexie provides a great supply of batteries and items needed to set up and maintain the Lumen hearing aids. Their app does a nice job assisting with hearing evaluation and set up and provides a convenient way to customize settings such as six different environment settings and changes to volume."

We just returned them, and went to a hearing aid store instead."

21,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Lucid Hearing Aids,These hearing aids are perfect for me. Specs are basically the same as the ones that cost thousands. They are just right for what I need at this time.

21,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Can you hear me now? Yep,These hearing aid are comfortable to wear and make a big difference in hearing.

21,BestBuy,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,Check replacement policies before you buy.,"My husband purchased this hearing aid set, which arrived last week. He was pleased with the quality, and was building up wear time as recommended. He had used them for two day, and lost one of them. Today we called to replace the list one, and found that we had to buy a whole new set. That was a surprise, and very disappointing. If you are shopping, you might check the policy for other hearing aid companies, as I suspect loss is not uncommon. This is not a Best Buy policy, but a Lucid policy."

21,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Amazing!,I have moderate to severe hearing loss and these over the ear hearing aides are great! I have had them for 2 months now and love them.. they are small and unnoticeable. They truly last a full 20hrs.. the bluetooth works great and the sound quality is good! I can even wear them while riding motorcycle and talk on the work phone which is not connected to the blue tooth. I hope they last at least a year or so.
21,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Good aids at great price.,"Only used a week and my first hearing aid. I like how adjustable they are, particularly with the App. For normal conversation and TV “Mild” works best for me. Have not yet been in a noisy restaurant with them. Streaming sound for music definitely badly missing low end, even using equalizer but that’s not really what I bought them for. Sounds fine for iPhone use and conversation. Beltone recommended their most powerful and expensive prescription hearing aids at $2500 which would have been overkill, as I only need the lowest setting on these, which I got on sale for 750$!"
21,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Helping my dad hear,"Purchased this for my father who has never worn hearing aids. Once he tried it and could properly hear while out to eat and watching TV, he was hooked. He loves that he can take a phone call with them or stream from his phone. My mom loves it too since the TV is no longer at max volume. The app was easy to set up and allows for ease of use.
Would recommend to anyone looking to enter into hearing aids or buy for a loved one who could use help hearing."

He was pleased with the quality, and was building up wear time as recommended. He had used them for two day, and lost one of them. Today we called to replace the list one, and found that we had to buy a whole new set. That was a surprise, and very disappointing. If you are shopping, you might check the policy for other hearing aid companies, as I suspect loss is not uncommon. This is not a Best Buy policy, but a Lucid policy."

88,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Go Ultra OTC Hearing Aids,"I received the Go Hearing, Go Ultra OTC Hearing Aids in Gray. They seem to be well made and durable. They are comfortable to wear, don't fall out easily. I don't think they are right for my situation though, as I had a lot of whistling noises and my own voice was very amplified. I only have hearing loss in one ear.

Now I let my mother try them as she has more hearing loss than I do in both ears, and she said they were very clear, no noises or voice amplified and worked just as good as the ones she uses regularly.

Go Ultra hearing aids come in a nicely designed box with a compact recharge case that could easily fit in a bag or purse, it includes your hearing aids, an instruction manual, and several different tube lengths and dome tips.

Go Ultra comes with rechargeable batteries and allows 20 hours of battery life per charge.
allows Bluetooth streaming to iPhone and Android devices, does not allow customization to your specific hearing loss. Instead, the device has four pre-set programs, does not have a smartphone app. All adjustments are made through buttons on the back of the device.

Go Ultra has two buttons on each device. Here is a quick rundown of what each button does. 
Top Button - a 3-second press turns the hearing aids on and off a quick press and release increases the volume 
Bottom button - a 3-second press changes programs, a quick press and release decrease the volume, a quick press and release accepts or ends phone calls.

Go Ultra is worth a look if you are on a tight budget, have mild-moderate hearing loss, and need a device for simple listening situations like TV-watching."
88,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Very comfortable and work well,"These hearing aids work well and are very comfortable.  Setup is straightforward.  Out of the box, the first thing to do is charge them, which takes about three hours in the included charging case.  When I charged mine, they were ready to go in less than an hour.

The charging case holds the two aids only one way, so inserting them is no problem, and the case itself is charged along with the aids when plugged into the wall.  The case itself can then be used to charge the aids up to three time (according to the manual) if you’re away from a wall outlet.

To set up the aids for your ears, you begin by using the included “ear measuring tool,” which is a piece of L-shaped cardboard that hangs over your ear and measures the distance from the top of the location where your ear attaches to your head to the top of your ear canal.  The range of measurements is “1,” “2,” or “3,” and I am a 3.  The result of this measurement determines which of the three “ear tubes” you attach to the aids.

You then select the desired “ear dome” that attaches to the side of the aid that is inserted in your ear.  There are two types of domes, “open” and “closed,” where the choice depends on the type of results you want to experience.  The open dome is for more “natural” sound, while the closed dome emphasizes the bass registers, according to the manual.  Each dome type comes in three sizes. I use the open domes.

Inserting the aids in your ears is simple as they can go in only one way. Slide the top part of the aid (with the two control buttons) over your ear, insert the other end into your ear, and hook the little plastic wire attached to the aid around inside your outer ear to brace the aid in place.  I have found these aids, after three day of use, to be so comfortable that I forget that they’re there.  Wearing a pair of glasses over them is no issue at all.

The aids are turned on by a three-second press of one of the two buttons on each one.  The devices will say “power on,” and you’re off and running.  There are ten volume settings that you select by pressing the volume-up or volume-down buttons one step at a time.  After each press, the aids beep once to indicate that a new volume level has been selected.  When you reach the maximum or minimum, they beep three times.  I find that setting the volume levels at about the half-way point is best for me.  At the higher volume levels, the sound can be quite loud and shrill.

My hearing loss is considered mild and is concentrated at the higher frequencies. I also have been finding it more difficult to hear conversations in a noisy room.  So far, after three days of use, I’m finding it much easier to hear what’s going on around me.

In addition to acting as hearing aids, these units also feature Bluetooth capability, and they can be paired with your smartphone or any Bluetooth device.  Pairing them with my phone was a snap, and I can now both listen to music or whatever over my hearing aids as well as hearing the person I’m speaking with on a phone call.  

People with hearing aids are precluded from using earbuds because both need to be inserted into the ear to use, and there is room, obviously, for only one.  The combined capability of these aids neatly solves this problem. The one drawback to using the Bluetooth feature is that it greatly shortens the battery life.  I’ve not had a chance to test this, but the manual says that, without using Bluetooth, the batteries should last about 20 hours between charges.  When using Bluetooth, that drops to eight hours.

The box includes thin cleaning wires which are used to clean the ear tubes should the become clogged with wax.  I recommend keeping these handy as I have already needed them once.

Overall, I strongly recommend that anyone with mild hearing loss give these a try."

88,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Very happy,"So after getting about a week of use to give a fair and balanced review and opinion of these hearing aids there are some goods and only one real bad that i can find. Now i have a second set of hearing aids and i will not go into those but i'm kind of using those as a reference for these new ones i got. So first these come with a built in charger and when you put them in there case for the night you have a fully charged set,so you save some money because you do not need to buy hearing aid batteries and that's a big plus with these. My other ones you need to replace the batteries and they only last about two days of constant use. The sound quality is outstanding and also you do not need to have them set up with bluetooth with your phone unless you are going to stream music with them also then you need to set them up via bluetooth but not a big deal but it's nice if your picking them up only as hearing aids. I'll be honest with you the big appeal of these was the fact i can use them to stream music at work vs having my hearing aid and a set of earbuds also on me. I can use them as my go to hearing aids and earbuds for music and that is a very nice plus. But and you know there is always a but and that is if you use them only as hearing aids the battery life is great like 20 hours plus but if you stream with them it knocks the battery life down to about 4 hours. Bluetooth is very demanding for power and i know there is another way you can stream with earbuds a setting that they have to come with and it hooks up but not bluetooth and unfortunately these don't have them. It's not a big deal for me because i only listen to music for about 2 hours so by the time i am able to listen to them there is still a lot of battery power left. So al in all im am super happy with them. The streaming volume is not as loud as earbuds are but it's loud enough to stream your music."
88,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Comfortable and discreet,"I have been using the go hearing go uktra for a few weeks now and have loved the comfort of them. They are lightweight and fit really well in my ear and around it. Unlike others these dont irritate or bother me when wearing them for long periods of time. These come as a set, they come with a charging case with cable and adapter, open and closed domes as well as slim tubes. I love that the tubes are very discreet and are barely noticeable when wearing. As someone whose self consious of having to wear a hearing aid, this was my favorite feature. I love that it comes with a charging case because every night i can put them in the case to charge and not risk losing them or misplacing them. I can use them all day on one charge which is very convenient for me as im constantly on the go! I also love that i am able to stream calls, music, and even my social medias while wearing them! I have been able to hear great with these and they have helped tremendously with my hearing when i need it. Overall i highly reccomend the gonhearing go ultra hearing aids because they are comfortable and discreet and provide you the hearing that you deserve to have!"
88,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Improved hearing at a reasonable price point,"Go Hearing - Go Ultra OTC Hearing Aids – Gray

It’s certainly reassuring when the first thing you see when you open the box on these over-the-counter hearing aids is a blue card stating “Need Assistance? We’re here to help.” Included on that card is a phone number and web site URL where you can go for expert assistance. That’s a nice and welcome touch, since you usually need to go digging around for that information on many other products when you need help.

At first glance, the 48-page Go Ultra OTC hearing aid user manual seemed like a lot to digest. However, once I started reading through it, I realized that it was taking me, step-by-step, though the setup and use of these hearing aids. When I finished reading it, I felt that I had a very good understanding of the product, so I didn’t have to wonder how things worked. Very impressive and comforting! 

The unit comes with a portable charging/carrying/storage case which was already partially charged upon arrival. In less than an hour, I had three green lights, indicating that the charging unit itself and the two hearing aids inside were fully charged. It takes about three hours to get a full charge and under normal use, that full charge is supposed to last about 20 hours, depending on how you’ve set things up and how much you’ve used them. I prefer rechargeable hearing aids like these over the type that require installing special batteries, but that’s a personal preference. I find that it’s much easier to locate an outlet to plug the charging case into than it is to find a store that sells the special batteries that some hearing aids operate on.

These hearing aids come with multiple size ear domes (four each of small, medium, and large sizes) and six slim tubes (two each of sizes 1, 2 and 3) to help make sure you get the best fit. 

While you may have to try on the different ear domes to decide which one gives you the best fit, there’s a measuring guide for both the right and left ear that lets you know which of the three slim tubes is the appropriate size without you having to try each of them on. However, you may find that the ones pre-installed on the hearing aids work just fine for you. That’s what happened in our case.

While some similar devices use a phone app to control and adjust the various settings, these hearing aids don’t require any outside devices to control things. Instead, it has four built-in preset programs that you can choose from by simply toggling between them, using the built-in buttons located on the rear of the hearing aids. And then, the next time you use the hearing aids, it remembers and uses the last program and settings you used.

Once setup is complete and you’ve got your settings where you want them, the real test comes when you’re ready to try out these hearing aids under multiple conditions. My wife, who suffers from moderate hearing loss, used these under different conditions and found that they work well at improving her everyday listening. Her only initial problem was trying to remember what all the different presses of the control buttons on the rear of the hearing aids do. To help her with that, I made her a “cheat sheet” copy from the user’s manual. And I can also confirm that these hearing aids seem to be working well, since I no longer hear “What did you say?” whenever I speak to her.

And finally, it’s good to know that they come with a one-year warranty on both parts and labor.

Over-the-counter hearing aids are here to stay, and these Go Ultra OTC hearing aids could certainly be a good choice for those who prefer the behind-the-ear style."
88,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,"Go Ultra, Go Comfort!","These Go Ultra OTC Hearing Aids from Go Hearing have actually surprised me in a good way.  I initially thought because I wear glasses, I needed hearing aids that weren’t over-the-ear.  I was wrong.  If I simply put in the new Go Ultras first and then my glasses, I may get an initial clanking noise (not if I’m careful) when the temple bars of my glasses makes contact with the body of the aids, but that’s it for the rest of the day.  Cool.  And since we’re on the topic of comfort, these are SO much more comfortable than an all-in-the-ear-canal micro-aid I’ve also given a try…and much less, if any, feedback.  Wearing them all day doesn’t seem to cause any irritation/discomfort that I’ve experienced in the past. 

Let’s talk about being inconspicuous.  My silvery white hair flows ever-so-gracefully down to the top and around the back of my ears.  (I paid a lot for these highlights!)  I wore the new set of Go Ultra aids all day and no one in my family noticed them.  I had to point them out.

Charging case — These aids are so much more flexible to live with on a daily basis because they are rechargeable.  I hate having to change out hearing aid batteries, and their cost, and their disposal, etc., etc.  With the Go Ultras, you don’t have to worry about that.

These aids come with a plethora of different sized ear plugs, tubes, and cleaning tools.  All good.  I’ll advise you now to be patient when going through the setup and sizing.  It takes time and some experimentation.  You may become frustrated at first, but once you find the magic fit, you’re set.  It’s worth the little bit of hassle at the outset.

There are a couple things I wish were different —

First, when going through the setup, if you find that you need a different sized tube, you may find it difficult to turn and separate the tube from the main body of the hearing aid.  I finally got it, but it wasn’t easy.  Do NOT pull on the tube itself.  Follow the instructions (which I thought were pretty well written by someone who seemed to have a decent grasp of the English language.  That’s rare these days).  The silicone buds were much easier to deal with — and they give you two styles, open and closed.  Since I have one ear much worse than the other, I’ve actually gone with the closed style on my bad side, and open on the other.  Nice to have the option.

That last thing that bothers me a bit is the battery life when using a bluetooth connection.  It’s awesome that you can connect with your phone to make or answer calls, or stream music.  But doing so quickly uses battery power.  You can go from lasting all day (10-12 hrs just as a hearing aid), to lasting 3-4 hours if you’re constantly streaming or talking on the phone.  I’ve found it easier for me to simply pull the Go Ultra bud out of my ear and talk on the phone as I normally would.  Using the speakerphone works, as well (as is the hands-free phone in the car.)

If you're considering trying some OTC before spending thousands, Go Ultra is worth the try.  If they work for you, like they do for me, it can be life-changing."
88,BestBuy,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,Comfortable,"This pair of hearing aids are comfortable for me to wear and the style I prefer.  Personally I prefer those around to know that I do have hearing loss.  Using ones that go in the ear (like earbuds) I get questioned at work with them and have to explain they are hearing aids.  I also have a lump in my left ear wear those sit and so they are always coming out.  With this style, they are behind my ear and then they have the part that goes directly into the ear canal.  They don’t come out as easy and if they do, they are still held in place and don’t fall to the ground.  I also like that they were easy to connect to phone and you can use these as hearing aides but also to listen to apps like YouTube and to take calls.  However, that is it for me as far as positive things. 

Sound quality was super quiet for me.  And even worse if they did come out even a little. I felt I could hear more without these.  All of the other hearing aids I have get much louder.  These do not have an app to adjust settings as well.  I was hoping that because they are made by Lexie that the Lexie app would work but it did not.  An app would have been nice to do a simple test for each ear and then adjust them from that.  As well as just to adjust in general.  This is a bigger deal for me as what good are hearing aids is you can’t hear with them.

The case is a bit bulky as well, but I like that they are rechargeable and the case acts like a battery back up to charge them.  The cord though could be a little longer as it’s short.  

These I give a 2 star just for the comfort and because they were easy to connect and when connected they allow you to use with apps."
88,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Improved my hearing and it streams !,"I have used other OTC hearing aids and I find these to be far superior. 

Out of the box the hearing aids performed perfectly. You must read he included user manual to check for proper fitting and the purpose of the two push buttons. The only thing I changed was the dome and I changed it to small. I did not have to change the slim tubes but two others of different lengths are included in the box. Medium and large domes are included in the package along with a cleaning tool. 

The is no APP. The units have 4 preset settings, Normal to boost all sounds, high-frequency boost, low frequency boost and General which the manual said is for steaming music. My particular hearing loss requires a high-frequency boost and this setting works just fine for me. I vary the volume as necessary depending on my environment.

 When paired with my Android phone I am able to answer calls and actually hear the person and the callers hear me just fine. I can also stream music and it sounds great. My other OTC hearing aids ( which cost more )  do not have any streaming either for music or phone calls. It has been my experience that constant streaming music and talking on phone will reduce battery life to around 3-4 hours. Normal use will last all day. I charge them at night. 

Left and right hearing aids can be adjusted separately for volume and the 4 sound presets directly from the device. Again, no APP is provided or needed. That is not possible with my current OTC hearing aids that require an internet connection to make significant parameter changes. Again, a big plus for this product.

The units were charged upon arrival. The very odd thing is the charging case. The case has a battery that allows me to charge the hearing aids  around 3 times without having it plugged in. That is very convenient  In order to recharge the case battery you must connect the charging cable to the bottom of the case so you have to lay it on its side. How can such a well thought out product have this, in my opinion, design flaw. There are LED’s on the case that provide status of the hearing aid battery and the charging case battery. 

The streaming is a game changer. I no longer have to put up with feedback when holding my phone up to my ear with my other OTC hearing aids. I can not go back to my other OTC hearing aids. I have been spoiled with this great product, it has far exceeded my expectations for an OTC hearing aid."

The hearing aids have 4 preprogrammed settings. These are utilized by selecting the multi-function button B. 
The charging case has 3 led lights; the center is for the case and the others for each hearing aid. Blue for charging and green for charged. I found that if the light does not illuminate the earpiece is not correctly mounted. 
After initial charging set-up one took a few minutes. The hearing aids are light weight and did not cause any discomfort during prolonged use. After adjusting the sound level to my liking, I was done with the set-up. I wore the hearing aids for 10 hours doing normal everyday things. The next day I put them back in and forgot they were there. 
The Go Ultra Hearing Aids are Bluetooth enabled. You can pair them to your phone or device. It was a strange feeling pairing to the phone, as I could hear the phone in both ears. This made the conversation easier to follow as I have better hearing in one ear than the other.
The Go Ultra Hearing Aids also have built in noise reduction. Battery life is expected to be 20 hours without Bluetooth. With Bluetooth enabled by not in use you can get about 8 hours. Streaming cuts it down to 2.5 to 3 hours. To fully charge the batteries place them back in the case and it takes up to 3 hours to recharge.
The Go Ultra Hearing Aids comes with a 45-day return policy. Try them and you will love them."
88,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Go Hearing - Go Ultra OTC Hearing Aids,"So I received my Go Hearing - Go Ultra OTC Hearing Aids about a week ago and have been putting them through their paces. Now I have not been properly diagnosed with any type of hearing loss, though, I have known myself for awhile that my dominant ear is my right ear, which means there has to be some hearing loss in my left ear.

Upon opening the box, you will find:

* Go Hearing Go Ultra OTC Hearing Aids (1 pair: Left & Right)
* Charging Case with Charging Cable & Adaptor
* Open Domes (2 Small, 2 Medium, and 2 Large)
* Closed Domes (2 Small, 2 Medium, and 2 Large)
* Slim Tube (2 Small, 2 Medium, and 2 Large)
* Cleaning Wire
* Cleaning Brush
* Ear Measurement Tool
* User Manual

To get  started, simply follow along with the User Manual. It's best to ensure the hearing aids are fully charged before using them. Once fully charged, these hearing aids are really to pair and connect with your smartphone. Something I noticed right off the bat is that there was no app to download, install, and create a user profile. I like that. It's simply hold to power them on and pair them through your bluetooth settings in your phone or other mobile device as you would any other bluetooth device. Using the included ear measurement tool will help with ensure you have the right sized slim tube. The tubes are a little hard to remove and replace, though with a little patience you should be able to remove the old slim tube and connect the right tube for proper fitting. After installing the correct slim tube, now you can replace the ear domes and choose from whether you prefer open domes or the closed domes. The closed domes seemed to work better for me. Your mileage may vary.

After proper fit and installation of the proper slim tubes and domes, you're ready to go. Initially i found the sound to be very teeny until I got the correct tubes and domes installed and was able to hear much better and clearer. And they feel wonderful in my ears. Each hearing aid works independent of one another, which is something that I absolutely love. I can wear the right one and keep the left one charged or vice versa. Or wear both of them at the same time. 

A couple of great features that I love about the Go Ultra OTC hearing aids aside from them working independent of one another, is the fact that they stream music flawlessly without any issue. Calls were clear and not muffled like I've had on other more expensive hearing aid sets. One thing I would like to see, is an easier way to remove the slim wires, it took me a few minutes to remove these, but I managed. Other than that they are a decent budget pair of hearing aids that I will use."
88,BestBuy,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,You get what you pay for,"Made by Lexie, the Go Ultra is a pair of simple to use, relatively inexpensive, over-the-counter (OTC) hearing aids, but they are hearing aids with some major drawbacks.

The units are reasonably sized for OTC rechargeables, and are very lightweight. Much like earbuds, they have a charging case that serves as a battery pack for charging the hearing aids. The case itself is charged using a standard USB-C cable. A single charge to the Go Ultra will last about 22 hours, according to the company.

Setup is relatively simple, following the pattern of most over-the-ear, OTC hearing aids. For physical fit, you use a sizer to determine the proper length of wire and select the appropriate dome. Each hearing aid has a power button that doubles as volume up and a program select button that doubles as a sound profile selector. And those rudimentary settings are part of the problem with the Go Ultra. Each hearing aid is adjusted individually, and they remember your previous settings between charges.

Everyone has a hearing profile, where certain frequencies are diminished and others are clear. A hearing test, either on your phone, on-line, or through an audiologist, will help you determine your profile. But the Go Ultra doesn't have any of these tests, but instead uses a rather crude series of sound profiles; normal, high frequency, low frequency, and high gain (like normal, but with additional volume boosting). If, like me, you have low and high frequency loss, there is no setting that works properly. In fact, it’s hard to imagine who has hearing loss that matches these broad settings. It’s like trying to paint trim with a roller.

The Go Ultra will connect via Bluetooth, and connection is simple. You can then stream music and take calls, although no one is going to confuse these with quality earbuds. It also appears that the streaming sound is not impacted by the selected sound profile. If you have trouble hearing high frequencies in your music, you will still have issues hearing high frequencies in your music.

But, the main purpose of any hearing aid is to help your hearing, and this is where I had real issues with the Go Ultra. Voices, rustling paper, and other common sounds were harsh and artificial sounding. In fact, so long as the volume of the person speaking was not too soft I could hear conversations better unaided than with these. My own voice was abnormally amplified. I have worn a single hearing aid for about a decade, and this is the first time I’ve experienced this. Sounds were also slightly delayed. With two hearing aids in things weren’t overly bad, but with one in there was a ricochet effect, where the unassisted ear heard things a fraction of a second earlier than the aided ear. Most likely the effect of a slow processor in the hearing aids, t was, at best, distracting.

Most people are probably going to be a lot better off with something else. Yes, a better set will undoubtably cost quite a bit more, but sometimes you really do get exactly what you pay for."
88,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Go Hearing's Ultra OTC Hearing Aids Are Quite Good,"I received a pair of Go Hearing - Go Ultra OTC Hearing Aids to use, test and review with the review to be posted on Best Buy's website.

As I am very hard of hearing and also have tinnitus, I was very interested in Go Hearing's latest product as, to date, I have not found the perfect pair of hearing aids for my hearing condition and have not been fully satisfied with any of them I've tried before. 

The grey-colored Go Hearing Ultra OTC Hearing Aids arrived nicely boxed, with a rechargeable case for the hearing aids to nest in. The case acts as a charging station so no batteries are needed. These hearing aids are designed for use not, only to hear better, but also allow Buetooth connecction with smarphones allowing listening to digital music, podcasts and acceptance of phones calls while wearing. The Go Hearing Ultra are considerably less expensive than most prescription hearing aids with more features than many.

The Go Hearing Ultra Hearing Aids are grey in color and sit behind each ear making them somewhat inconspicuous. The fit via clear plastic tubing into your ear canal and come packaged with a number of different size in-ear buds to allow the user to find the perfect fit for their ears. Volume controls and a button to accept phone calls is positioned on the behind-ear hearing aid units making it easy and convenient to control the use of the hearing aids.

I only have one issue with the Go Hearing Ultra hearing aids - the inability to adjust the sound quality - treble, medium and bass. Other than that these are very good hearing aid units for the price!"
88,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Work Well and Easy to Use,"Reading through the included manual it does not tell me to install an app.  WooHoo!  A product that doesn’t need an app to work.  I plugged them in to charge.  Turns out they are shipped with a bit of paper covering the contacts!  So be sure to remove the paper from the contacts on each earpiece before charging!  Being used to an earbud style for any type of device in my ear, I was a bit nervous about putting the earpiece into my ear.  The directions said to hold your ear and pull it straight with your other hand to help insert the earpiece.  That technique worked great.  Once they are in your ears you don’t realize they are there.  I know they work because I only have to turn the television to one third the volume I do when I’m not wearing them.  Connecting to my phone was easy.  In the Bluetooth area the “Go Ultra” device simply showed up.  (The hearing aids were on and in my ears when I did this).  When making a phone call the Go Ultra device shows up on the phone just like “Speaker” so you can choose to use them for the phone call or not.  All in all, they work well and are easy to use.  The charging case charges even when it’s not plugged in (if the case has been charged) which is great for travel.  One item that takes a bit of getting used to is the retention wire that is used to help remove the dome from the ear.  If it sticks out too far, like it did when I first tried the hearing aids, then you need to insert the dome  into the ear.  Remember they are not earbuds!  I called customer service to inquire about the retention wire because it was sticking out past my ear.  I didn’t believe the recording when it said the wait time was 9 seconds.  The call was answered by a real person in about 3 seconds.  (Yes, I timed them).   Amazing in this day and age!"
88,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Nice to hear again!!,"I like my Go Ultra OTC hearing aids! I can hear better. Still adjusting to all the different things I can hear that I couldn't before. They have blutooth! That's nice! I can watch videos or listen to music without bothering anyone with loud volume. The only thing I don't like is while blutooth is active I can still hear everything else. It's not what I thought. It's not really a bad thing. Just threw me off at first. If you know you don't hear well, I recommend them!!"

88,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Bid Improvement,Took a little bit to tune in but that’s due to me. Very pleased to be able to hear again. My hearing is terrible and these hearing aids have made a big difference. Only problem I have is having to buy batteries since I didn’t purchase 250.00 charging unit
88,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Go Ultra OTC Hearing Aids,"I received the Go Hearing, Go Ultra OTC Hearing Aids in Gray. They seem to be well made and durable. They are comfortable to wear, don't fall out easily. I don't think they are right for my situation though, as I had a lot of whistling noises and my own voice was very amplified. I only have hearing loss in one ear.

Now I let my mother try them as she has more hearing loss than I do in both ears, and she said they were very clear, no noises or voice amplified and worked just as good as the ones she uses regularly.

Go Ultra hearing aids come in a nicely designed box with a compact recharge case that could easily fit in a bag or purse, it includes your hearing aids, an instruction manual, and several different tube lengths and dome tips.

Go Ultra comes with rechargeable batteries and allows 20 hours of battery life per charge.
allows Bluetooth streaming to iPhone and Android devices, does not allow customization to your specific hearing loss. Instead, the device has four pre-set programs, does not have a smartphone app. All adjustments are made through buttons on the back of the device.

Go Ultra has two buttons on each device. Here is a quick rundown of what each button does. 
Top Button - a 3-second press turns the hearing aids on and off a quick press and release increases the volume 
Bottom button - a 3-second press changes programs, a quick press and release decrease the volume, a quick press and release accepts or ends phone calls.

Go Ultra is worth a look if you are on a tight budget, have mild-moderate hearing loss, and need a device for simple listening situations like TV-watching."
88,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Very comfortable and work well,"These hearing aids work well and are very comfortable.  Setup is straightforward.  Out of the box, the first thing to do is charge them, which takes about three hours in the included charging case.  When I charged mine, they were ready to go in less than an hour.

The charging case holds the two aids only one way, so inserting them is no problem, and the case itself is charged along with the aids when plugged into the wall.  The case itself can then be used to charge the aids up to three time (according to the manual) if you’re away from a wall outlet.

To set up the aids for your ears, you begin by using the included “ear measuring tool,” which is a piece of L-shaped cardboard that hangs over your ear and measures the distance from the top of the location where your ear attaches to your head to the top of your ear canal.  The range of measurements is “1,” “2,” or “3,” and I am a 3.  The result of this measurement determines which of the three “ear tubes” you attach to the aids.

You then select the desired “ear dome” that attaches to the side of the aid that is inserted in your ear.  There are two types of domes, “open” and “closed,” where the choice depends on the type of results you want to experience.  The open dome is for more “natural” sound, while the closed dome emphasizes the bass registers, according to the manual.  Each dome type comes in three sizes. I use the open domes.

Inserting the aids in your ears is simple as they can go in only one way. Slide the top part of the aid (with the two control buttons) over your ear, insert the other end into your ear, and hook the little plastic wire attached to the aid around inside your outer ear to brace the aid in place.  I have found these aids, after three day of use, to be so comfortable that I forget that they’re there.  Wearing a pair of glasses over them is no issue at all.

The aids are turned on by a three-second press of one of the two buttons on each one.  The devices will say “power on,” and you’re off and running.  There are ten volume settings that you select by pressing the volume-up or volume-down buttons one step at a time.  After each press, the aids beep once to indicate that a new volume level has been selected.  When you reach the maximum or minimum, they beep three times.  I find that setting the volume levels at about the half-way point is best for me.  At the higher volume levels, the sound can be quite loud and shrill.

My hearing loss is considered mild and is concentrated at the higher frequencies. I also have been finding it more difficult to hear conversations in a noisy room.  So far, after three days of use, I’m finding it much easier to hear what’s going on around me.

In addition to acting as hearing aids, these units also feature Bluetooth capability, and they can be paired with your smartphone or any Bluetooth device.  Pairing them with my phone was a snap, and I can now both listen to music or whatever over my hearing aids as well as hearing the person I’m speaking with on a phone call.  

People with hearing aids are precluded from using earbuds because both need to be inserted into the ear to use, and there is room, obviously, for only one.  The combined capability of these aids neatly solves this problem. The one drawback to using the Bluetooth feature is that it greatly shortens the battery life.  I’ve not had a chance to test this, but the manual says that, without using Bluetooth, the batteries should last about 20 hours between charges.  When using Bluetooth, that drops to eight hours.

The box includes thin cleaning wires which are used to clean the ear tubes should the become clogged with wax.  I recommend keeping these handy as I have already needed them once.

Overall, I strongly recommend that anyone with mild hearing loss give these a try."

88,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Very happy,"So after getting about a week of use to give a fair and balanced review and opinion of these hearing aids there are some goods and only one real bad that i can find. Now i have a second set of hearing aids and i will not go into those but i'm kind of using those as a reference for these new ones i got. So first these come with a built in charger and when you put them in there case for the night you have a fully charged set,so you save some money because you do not need to buy hearing aid batteries and that's a big plus with these. My other ones you need to replace the batteries and they only last about two days of constant use. The sound quality is outstanding and also you do not need to have them set up with bluetooth with your phone unless you are going to stream music with them also then you need to set them up via bluetooth but not a big deal but it's nice if your picking them up only as hearing aids. I'll be honest with you the big appeal of these was the fact i can use them to stream music at work vs having my hearing aid and a set of earbuds also on me. I can use them as my go to hearing aids and earbuds for music and that is a very nice plus. But and you know there is always a but and that is if you use them only as hearing aids the battery life is great like 20 hours plus but if you stream with them it knocks the battery life down to about 4 hours. Bluetooth is very demanding for power and i know there is another way you can stream with earbuds a setting that they have to come with and it hooks up but not bluetooth and unfortunately these don't have them. It's not a big deal for me because i only listen to music for about 2 hours so by the time i am able to listen to them there is still a lot of battery power left. So al in all im am super happy with them. The streaming volume is not as loud as earbuds are but it's loud enough to stream your music."
88,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Comfortable and discreet,"I have been using the go hearing go uktra for a few weeks now and have loved the comfort of them. They are lightweight and fit really well in my ear and around it. Unlike others these dont irritate or bother me when wearing them for long periods of time. These come as a set, they come with a charging case with cable and adapter, open and closed domes as well as slim tubes. I love that the tubes are very discreet and are barely noticeable when wearing. As someone whose self consious of having to wear a hearing aid, this was my favorite feature. I love that it comes with a charging case because every night i can put them in the case to charge and not risk losing them or misplacing them. I can use them all day on one charge which is very convenient for me as im constantly on the go! I also love that i am able to stream calls, music, and even my social medias while wearing them! I have been able to hear great with these and they have helped tremendously with my hearing when i need it. Overall i highly reccomend the gonhearing go ultra hearing aids because they are comfortable and discreet and provide you the hearing that you deserve to have!"
88,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Improved hearing at a reasonable price point,"Go Hearing - Go Ultra OTC Hearing Aids – Gray

It’s certainly reassuring when the first thing you see when you open the box on these over-the-counter hearing aids is a blue card stating “Need Assistance? We’re here to help.” Included on that card is a phone number and web site URL where you can go for expert assistance. That’s a nice and welcome touch, since you usually need to go digging around for that information on many other products when you need help.

At first glance, the 48-page Go Ultra OTC hearing aid user manual seemed like a lot to digest. However, once I started reading through it, I realized that it was taking me, step-by-step, though the setup and use of these hearing aids. When I finished reading it, I felt that I had a very good understanding of the product, so I didn’t have to wonder how things worked. Very impressive and comforting! 

The unit comes with a portable charging/carrying/storage case which was already partially charged upon arrival. In less than an hour, I had three green lights, indicating that the charging unit itself and the two hearing aids inside were fully charged. It takes about three hours to get a full charge and under normal use, that full charge is supposed to last about 20 hours, depending on how you’ve set things up and how much you’ve used them. I prefer rechargeable hearing aids like these over the type that require installing special batteries, but that’s a personal preference. I find that it’s much easier to locate an outlet to plug the charging case into than it is to find a store that sells the special batteries that some hearing aids operate on.

These hearing aids come with multiple size ear domes (four each of small, medium, and large sizes) and six slim tubes (two each of sizes 1, 2 and 3) to help make sure you get the best fit. 

While you may have to try on the different ear domes to decide which one gives you the best fit, there’s a measuring guide for both the right and left ear that lets you know which of the three slim tubes is the appropriate size without you having to try each of them on. However, you may find that the ones pre-installed on the hearing aids work just fine for you. That’s what happened in our case.

While some similar devices use a phone app to control and adjust the various settings, these hearing aids don’t require any outside devices to control things. Instead, it has four built-in preset programs that you can choose from by simply toggling between them, using the built-in buttons located on the rear of the hearing aids. And then, the next time you use the hearing aids, it remembers and uses the last program and settings you used.

Once setup is complete and you’ve got your settings where you want them, the real test comes when you’re ready to try out these hearing aids under multiple conditions. My wife, who suffers from moderate hearing loss, used these under different conditions and found that they work well at improving her everyday listening. Her only initial problem was trying to remember what all the different presses of the control buttons on the rear of the hearing aids do. To help her with that, I made her a “cheat sheet” copy from the user’s manual. And I can also confirm that these hearing aids seem to be working well, since I no longer hear “What did you say?” whenever I speak to her.

And finally, it’s good to know that they come with a one-year warranty on both parts and labor.

Over-the-counter hearing aids are here to stay, and these Go Ultra OTC hearing aids could certainly be a good choice for those who prefer the behind-the-ear style."
88,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,"Go Ultra, Go Comfort!","These Go Ultra OTC Hearing Aids from Go Hearing have actually surprised me in a good way.  I initially thought because I wear glasses, I needed hearing aids that weren’t over-the-ear.  I was wrong.  If I simply put in the new Go Ultras first and then my glasses, I may get an initial clanking noise (not if I’m careful) when the temple bars of my glasses makes contact with the body of the aids, but that’s it for the rest of the day.  Cool.  And since we’re on the topic of comfort, these are SO much more comfortable than an all-in-the-ear-canal micro-aid I’ve also given a try…and much less, if any, feedback.  Wearing them all day doesn’t seem to cause any irritation/discomfort that I’ve experienced in the past. 

Let’s talk about being inconspicuous.  My silvery white hair flows ever-so-gracefully down to the top and around the back of my ears.  (I paid a lot for these highlights!)  I wore the new set of Go Ultra aids all day and no one in my family noticed them.  I had to point them out.

Charging case — These aids are so much more flexible to live with on a daily basis because they are rechargeable.  I hate having to change out hearing aid batteries, and their cost, and their disposal, etc., etc.  With the Go Ultras, you don’t have to worry about that.

These aids come with a plethora of different sized ear plugs, tubes, and cleaning tools.  All good.  I’ll advise you now to be patient when going through the setup and sizing.  It takes time and some experimentation.  You may become frustrated at first, but once you find the magic fit, you’re set.  It’s worth the little bit of hassle at the outset.

There are a couple things I wish were different —

First, when going through the setup, if you find that you need a different sized tube, you may find it difficult to turn and separate the tube from the main body of the hearing aid.  I finally got it, but it wasn’t easy.  Do NOT pull on the tube itself.  Follow the instructions (which I thought were pretty well written by someone who seemed to have a decent grasp of the English language.  That’s rare these days).  The silicone buds were much easier to deal with — and they give you two styles, open and closed.  Since I have one ear much worse than the other, I’ve actually gone with the closed style on my bad side, and open on the other.  Nice to have the option.

That last thing that bothers me a bit is the battery life when using a bluetooth connection.  It’s awesome that you can connect with your phone to make or answer calls, or stream music.  But doing so quickly uses battery power.  You can go from lasting all day (10-12 hrs just as a hearing aid), to lasting 3-4 hours if you’re constantly streaming or talking on the phone.  I’ve found it easier for me to simply pull the Go Ultra bud out of my ear and talk on the phone as I normally would.  Using the speakerphone works, as well (as is the hands-free phone in the car.)

If you're considering trying some OTC before spending thousands, Go Ultra is worth the try.  If they work for you, like they do for me, it can be life-changing."
88,BestBuy,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,Comfortable,"This pair of hearing aids are comfortable for me to wear and the style I prefer.  Personally I prefer those around to know that I do have hearing loss.  Using ones that go in the ear (like earbuds) I get questioned at work with them and have to explain they are hearing aids.  I also have a lump in my left ear wear those sit and so they are always coming out.  With this style, they are behind my ear and then they have the part that goes directly into the ear canal.  They don’t come out as easy and if they do, they are still held in place and don’t fall to the ground.  I also like that they were easy to connect to phone and you can use these as hearing aides but also to listen to apps like YouTube and to take calls.  However, that is it for me as far as positive things. 

Sound quality was super quiet for me.  And even worse if they did come out even a little. I felt I could hear more without these.  All of the other hearing aids I have get much louder.  These do not have an app to adjust settings as well.  I was hoping that because they are made by Lexie that the Lexie app would work but it did not.  An app would have been nice to do a simple test for each ear and then adjust them from that.  As well as just to adjust in general.  This is a bigger deal for me as what good are hearing aids is you can’t hear with them.

The case is a bit bulky as well, but I like that they are rechargeable and the case acts like a battery back up to charge them.  The cord though could be a little longer as it’s short.  

These I give a 2 star just for the comfort and because they were easy to connect and when connected they allow you to use with apps."
88,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Improved my hearing and it streams !,"I have used other OTC hearing aids and I find these to be far superior. 

Out of the box the hearing aids performed perfectly. You must read he included user manual to check for proper fitting and the purpose of the two push buttons. The only thing I changed was the dome and I changed it to small. I did not have to change the slim tubes but two others of different lengths are included in the box. Medium and large domes are included in the package along with a cleaning tool. 

The is no APP. The units have 4 preset settings, Normal to boost all sounds, high-frequency boost, low frequency boost and General which the manual said is for steaming music. My particular hearing loss requires a high-frequency boost and this setting works just fine for me. I vary the volume as necessary depending on my environment.

 When paired with my Android phone I am able to answer calls and actually hear the person and the callers hear me just fine. I can also stream music and it sounds great. My other OTC hearing aids ( which cost more )  do not have any streaming either for music or phone calls. It has been my experience that constant streaming music and talking on phone will reduce battery life to around 3-4 hours. Normal use will last all day. I charge them at night. 

Left and right hearing aids can be adjusted separately for volume and the 4 sound presets directly from the device. Again, no APP is provided or needed. That is not possible with my current OTC hearing aids that require an internet connection to make significant parameter changes. Again, a big plus for this product.

The units were charged upon arrival. The very odd thing is the charging case. The case has a battery that allows me to charge the hearing aids  around 3 times without having it plugged in. That is very convenient  In order to recharge the case battery you must connect the charging cable to the bottom of the case so you have to lay it on its side. How can such a well thought out product have this, in my opinion, design flaw. There are LED’s on the case that provide status of the hearing aid battery and the charging case battery. 

The streaming is a game changer. I no longer have to put up with feedback when holding my phone up to my ear with my other OTC hearing aids. I can not go back to my other OTC hearing aids. I have been spoiled with this great product, it has far exceeded my expectations for an OTC hearing aid."

The hearing aids have 4 preprogrammed settings. These are utilized by selecting the multi-function button B. 
The charging case has 3 led lights; the center is for the case and the others for each hearing aid. Blue for charging and green for charged. I found that if the light does not illuminate the earpiece is not correctly mounted. 
After initial charging set-up one took a few minutes. The hearing aids are light weight and did not cause any discomfort during prolonged use. After adjusting the sound level to my liking, I was done with the set-up. I wore the hearing aids for 10 hours doing normal everyday things. The next day I put them back in and forgot they were there. 
The Go Ultra Hearing Aids are Bluetooth enabled. You can pair them to your phone or device. It was a strange feeling pairing to the phone, as I could hear the phone in both ears. This made the conversation easier to follow as I have better hearing in one ear than the other.
The Go Ultra Hearing Aids also have built in noise reduction. Battery life is expected to be 20 hours without Bluetooth. With Bluetooth enabled by not in use you can get about 8 hours. Streaming cuts it down to 2.5 to 3 hours. To fully charge the batteries place them back in the case and it takes up to 3 hours to recharge.
The Go Ultra Hearing Aids comes with a 45-day return policy. Try them and you will love them."
88,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Go Hearing - Go Ultra OTC Hearing Aids,"So I received my Go Hearing - Go Ultra OTC Hearing Aids about a week ago and have been putting them through their paces. Now I have not been properly diagnosed with any type of hearing loss, though, I have known myself for awhile that my dominant ear is my right ear, which means there has to be some hearing loss in my left ear.

Upon opening the box, you will find:

* Go Hearing Go Ultra OTC Hearing Aids (1 pair: Left & Right)
* Charging Case with Charging Cable & Adaptor
* Open Domes (2 Small, 2 Medium, and 2 Large)
* Closed Domes (2 Small, 2 Medium, and 2 Large)
* Slim Tube (2 Small, 2 Medium, and 2 Large)
* Cleaning Wire
* Cleaning Brush
* Ear Measurement Tool
* User Manual

To get  started, simply follow along with the User Manual. It's best to ensure the hearing aids are fully charged before using them. Once fully charged, these hearing aids are really to pair and connect with your smartphone. Something I noticed right off the bat is that there was no app to download, install, and create a user profile. I like that. It's simply hold to power them on and pair them through your bluetooth settings in your phone or other mobile device as you would any other bluetooth device. Using the included ear measurement tool will help with ensure you have the right sized slim tube. The tubes are a little hard to remove and replace, though with a little patience you should be able to remove the old slim tube and connect the right tube for proper fitting. After installing the correct slim tube, now you can replace the ear domes and choose from whether you prefer open domes or the closed domes. The closed domes seemed to work better for me. Your mileage may vary.

After proper fit and installation of the proper slim tubes and domes, you're ready to go. Initially i found the sound to be very teeny until I got the correct tubes and domes installed and was able to hear much better and clearer. And they feel wonderful in my ears. Each hearing aid works independent of one another, which is something that I absolutely love. I can wear the right one and keep the left one charged or vice versa. Or wear both of them at the same time. 

A couple of great features that I love about the Go Ultra OTC hearing aids aside from them working independent of one another, is the fact that they stream music flawlessly without any issue. Calls were clear and not muffled like I've had on other more expensive hearing aid sets. One thing I would like to see, is an easier way to remove the slim wires, it took me a few minutes to remove these, but I managed. Other than that they are a decent budget pair of hearing aids that I will use."
88,BestBuy,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,You get what you pay for,"Made by Lexie, the Go Ultra is a pair of simple to use, relatively inexpensive, over-the-counter (OTC) hearing aids, but they are hearing aids with some major drawbacks.

The units are reasonably sized for OTC rechargeables, and are very lightweight. Much like earbuds, they have a charging case that serves as a battery pack for charging the hearing aids. The case itself is charged using a standard USB-C cable. A single charge to the Go Ultra will last about 22 hours, according to the company.

Setup is relatively simple, following the pattern of most over-the-ear, OTC hearing aids. For physical fit, you use a sizer to determine the proper length of wire and select the appropriate dome. Each hearing aid has a power button that doubles as volume up and a program select button that doubles as a sound profile selector. And those rudimentary settings are part of the problem with the Go Ultra. Each hearing aid is adjusted individually, and they remember your previous settings between charges.

Everyone has a hearing profile, where certain frequencies are diminished and others are clear. A hearing test, either on your phone, on-line, or through an audiologist, will help you determine your profile. But the Go Ultra doesn't have any of these tests, but instead uses a rather crude series of sound profiles; normal, high frequency, low frequency, and high gain (like normal, but with additional volume boosting). If, like me, you have low and high frequency loss, there is no setting that works properly. In fact, it’s hard to imagine who has hearing loss that matches these broad settings. It’s like trying to paint trim with a roller.

The Go Ultra will connect via Bluetooth, and connection is simple. You can then stream music and take calls, although no one is going to confuse these with quality earbuds. It also appears that the streaming sound is not impacted by the selected sound profile. If you have trouble hearing high frequencies in your music, you will still have issues hearing high frequencies in your music.

But, the main purpose of any hearing aid is to help your hearing, and this is where I had real issues with the Go Ultra. Voices, rustling paper, and other common sounds were harsh and artificial sounding. In fact, so long as the volume of the person speaking was not too soft I could hear conversations better unaided than with these. My own voice was abnormally amplified. I have worn a single hearing aid for about a decade, and this is the first time I’ve experienced this. Sounds were also slightly delayed. With two hearing aids in things weren’t overly bad, but with one in there was a ricochet effect, where the unassisted ear heard things a fraction of a second earlier than the aided ear. Most likely the effect of a slow processor in the hearing aids, t was, at best, distracting.

Most people are probably going to be a lot better off with something else. Yes, a better set will undoubtably cost quite a bit more, but sometimes you really do get exactly what you pay for."
88,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Go Hearing's Ultra OTC Hearing Aids Are Quite Good,"I received a pair of Go Hearing - Go Ultra OTC Hearing Aids to use, test and review with the review to be posted on Best Buy's website.

As I am very hard of hearing and also have tinnitus, I was very interested in Go Hearing's latest product as, to date, I have not found the perfect pair of hearing aids for my hearing condition and have not been fully satisfied with any of them I've tried before. 

The grey-colored Go Hearing Ultra OTC Hearing Aids arrived nicely boxed, with a rechargeable case for the hearing aids to nest in. The case acts as a charging station so no batteries are needed. These hearing aids are designed for use not, only to hear better, but also allow Buetooth connecction with smarphones allowing listening to digital music, podcasts and acceptance of phones calls while wearing. The Go Hearing Ultra are considerably less expensive than most prescription hearing aids with more features than many.

The Go Hearing Ultra Hearing Aids are grey in color and sit behind each ear making them somewhat inconspicuous. The fit via clear plastic tubing into your ear canal and come packaged with a number of different size in-ear buds to allow the user to find the perfect fit for their ears. Volume controls and a button to accept phone calls is positioned on the behind-ear hearing aid units making it easy and convenient to control the use of the hearing aids.

I only have one issue with the Go Hearing Ultra hearing aids - the inability to adjust the sound quality - treble, medium and bass. Other than that these are very good hearing aid units for the price!"
88,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Work Well and Easy to Use,"Reading through the included manual it does not tell me to install an app.  WooHoo!  A product that doesn’t need an app to work.  I plugged them in to charge.  Turns out they are shipped with a bit of paper covering the contacts!  So be sure to remove the paper from the contacts on each earpiece before charging!  Being used to an earbud style for any type of device in my ear, I was a bit nervous about putting the earpiece into my ear.  The directions said to hold your ear and pull it straight with your other hand to help insert the earpiece.  That technique worked great.  Once they are in your ears you don’t realize they are there.  I know they work because I only have to turn the television to one third the volume I do when I’m not wearing them.  Connecting to my phone was easy.  In the Bluetooth area the “Go Ultra” device simply showed up.  (The hearing aids were on and in my ears when I did this).  When making a phone call the Go Ultra device shows up on the phone just like “Speaker” so you can choose to use them for the phone call or not.  All in all, they work well and are easy to use.  The charging case charges even when it’s not plugged in (if the case has been charged) which is great for travel.  One item that takes a bit of getting used to is the retention wire that is used to help remove the dome from the ear.  If it sticks out too far, like it did when I first tried the hearing aids, then you need to insert the dome  into the ear.  Remember they are not earbuds!  I called customer service to inquire about the retention wire because it was sticking out past my ear.  I didn’t believe the recording when it said the wait time was 9 seconds.  The call was answered by a real person in about 3 seconds.  (Yes, I timed them).   Amazing in this day and age!"
88,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Nice to hear again!!,"I like my Go Ultra OTC hearing aids! I can hear better. Still adjusting to all the different things I can hear that I couldn't before. They have blutooth! That's nice! I can watch videos or listen to music without bothering anyone with loud volume. The only thing I don't like is while blutooth is active I can still hear everything else. It's not what I thought. It's not really a bad thing. Just threw me off at first. If you know you don't hear well, I recommend them!!"

88,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Bid Improvement,Took a little bit to tune in but that’s due to me. Very pleased to be able to hear again. My hearing is terrible and these hearing aids have made a big difference. Only problem I have is having to buy batteries since I didn’t purchase 250.00 charging unit
88,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Go Ultra OTC Hearing Aids,"I received the Go Hearing, Go Ultra OTC Hearing Aids in Gray. They seem to be well made and durable. They are comfortable to wear, don't fall out easily. I don't think they are right for my situation though, as I had a lot of whistling noises and my own voice was very amplified. I only have hearing loss in one ear.

Now I let my mother try them as she has more hearing loss than I do in both ears, and she said they were very clear, no noises or voice amplified and worked just as good as the ones she uses regularly.

Go Ultra hearing aids come in a nicely designed box with a compact recharge case that could easily fit in a bag or purse, it includes your hearing aids, an instruction manual, and several different tube lengths and dome tips.

Go Ultra comes with rechargeable batteries and allows 20 hours of battery life per charge.
allows Bluetooth streaming to iPhone and Android devices, does not allow customization to your specific hearing loss. Instead, the device has four pre-set programs, does not have a smartphone app. All adjustments are made through buttons on the back of the device.

Go Ultra has two buttons on each device. Here is a quick rundown of what each button does. 
Top Button - a 3-second press turns the hearing aids on and off a quick press and release increases the volume 
Bottom button - a 3-second press changes programs, a quick press and release decrease the volume, a quick press and release accepts or ends phone calls.

Go Ultra is worth a look if you are on a tight budget, have mild-moderate hearing loss, and need a device for simple listening situations like TV-watching."
88,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Very comfortable and work well,"These hearing aids work well and are very comfortable.  Setup is straightforward.  Out of the box, the first thing to do is charge them, which takes about three hours in the included charging case.  When I charged mine, they were ready to go in less than an hour.

The charging case holds the two aids only one way, so inserting them is no problem, and the case itself is charged along with the aids when plugged into the wall.  The case itself can then be used to charge the aids up to three time (according to the manual) if you’re away from a wall outlet.

To set up the aids for your ears, you begin by using the included “ear measuring tool,” which is a piece of L-shaped cardboard that hangs over your ear and measures the distance from the top of the location where your ear attaches to your head to the top of your ear canal.  The range of measurements is “1,” “2,” or “3,” and I am a 3.  The result of this measurement determines which of the three “ear tubes” you attach to the aids.

You then select the desired “ear dome” that attaches to the side of the aid that is inserted in your ear.  There are two types of domes, “open” and “closed,” where the choice depends on the type of results you want to experience.  The open dome is for more “natural” sound, while the closed dome emphasizes the bass registers, according to the manual.  Each dome type comes in three sizes. I use the open domes.

Inserting the aids in your ears is simple as they can go in only one way. Slide the top part of the aid (with the two control buttons) over your ear, insert the other end into your ear, and hook the little plastic wire attached to the aid around inside your outer ear to brace the aid in place.  I have found these aids, after three day of use, to be so comfortable that I forget that they’re there.  Wearing a pair of glasses over them is no issue at all.

The aids are turned on by a three-second press of one of the two buttons on each one.  The devices will say “power on,” and you’re off and running.  There are ten volume settings that you select by pressing the volume-up or volume-down buttons one step at a time.  After each press, the aids beep once to indicate that a new volume level has been selected.  When you reach the maximum or minimum, they beep three times.  I find that setting the volume levels at about the half-way point is best for me.  At the higher volume levels, the sound can be quite loud and shrill.

My hearing loss is considered mild and is concentrated at the higher frequencies. I also have been finding it more difficult to hear conversations in a noisy room.  So far, after three days of use, I’m finding it much easier to hear what’s going on around me.

In addition to acting as hearing aids, these units also feature Bluetooth capability, and they can be paired with your smartphone or any Bluetooth device.  Pairing them with my phone was a snap, and I can now both listen to music or whatever over my hearing aids as well as hearing the person I’m speaking with on a phone call.  

People with hearing aids are precluded from using earbuds because both need to be inserted into the ear to use, and there is room, obviously, for only one.  The combined capability of these aids neatly solves this problem. The one drawback to using the Bluetooth feature is that it greatly shortens the battery life.  I’ve not had a chance to test this, but the manual says that, without using Bluetooth, the batteries should last about 20 hours between charges.  When using Bluetooth, that drops to eight hours.

The box includes thin cleaning wires which are used to clean the ear tubes should the become clogged with wax.  I recommend keeping these handy as I have already needed them once.

Overall, I strongly recommend that anyone with mild hearing loss give these a try."

88,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Very happy,"So after getting about a week of use to give a fair and balanced review and opinion of these hearing aids there are some goods and only one real bad that i can find. Now i have a second set of hearing aids and i will not go into those but i'm kind of using those as a reference for these new ones i got. So first these come with a built in charger and when you put them in there case for the night you have a fully charged set,so you save some money because you do not need to buy hearing aid batteries and that's a big plus with these. My other ones you need to replace the batteries and they only last about two days of constant use. The sound quality is outstanding and also you do not need to have them set up with bluetooth with your phone unless you are going to stream music with them also then you need to set them up via bluetooth but not a big deal but it's nice if your picking them up only as hearing aids. I'll be honest with you the big appeal of these was the fact i can use them to stream music at work vs having my hearing aid and a set of earbuds also on me. I can use them as my go to hearing aids and earbuds for music and that is a very nice plus. But and you know there is always a but and that is if you use them only as hearing aids the battery life is great like 20 hours plus but if you stream with them it knocks the battery life down to about 4 hours. Bluetooth is very demanding for power and i know there is another way you can stream with earbuds a setting that they have to come with and it hooks up but not bluetooth and unfortunately these don't have them. It's not a big deal for me because i only listen to music for about 2 hours so by the time i am able to listen to them there is still a lot of battery power left. So al in all im am super happy with them. The streaming volume is not as loud as earbuds are but it's loud enough to stream your music."
88,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Comfortable and discreet,"I have been using the go hearing go uktra for a few weeks now and have loved the comfort of them. They are lightweight and fit really well in my ear and around it. Unlike others these dont irritate or bother me when wearing them for long periods of time. These come as a set, they come with a charging case with cable and adapter, open and closed domes as well as slim tubes. I love that the tubes are very discreet and are barely noticeable when wearing. As someone whose self consious of having to wear a hearing aid, this was my favorite feature. I love that it comes with a charging case because every night i can put them in the case to charge and not risk losing them or misplacing them. I can use them all day on one charge which is very convenient for me as im constantly on the go! I also love that i am able to stream calls, music, and even my social medias while wearing them! I have been able to hear great with these and they have helped tremendously with my hearing when i need it. Overall i highly reccomend the gonhearing go ultra hearing aids because they are comfortable and discreet and provide you the hearing that you deserve to have!"
88,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Improved hearing at a reasonable price point,"Go Hearing - Go Ultra OTC Hearing Aids – Gray

It’s certainly reassuring when the first thing you see when you open the box on these over-the-counter hearing aids is a blue card stating “Need Assistance? We’re here to help.” Included on that card is a phone number and web site URL where you can go for expert assistance. That’s a nice and welcome touch, since you usually need to go digging around for that information on many other products when you need help.

At first glance, the 48-page Go Ultra OTC hearing aid user manual seemed like a lot to digest. However, once I started reading through it, I realized that it was taking me, step-by-step, though the setup and use of these hearing aids. When I finished reading it, I felt that I had a very good understanding of the product, so I didn’t have to wonder how things worked. Very impressive and comforting! 

The unit comes with a portable charging/carrying/storage case which was already partially charged upon arrival. In less than an hour, I had three green lights, indicating that the charging unit itself and the two hearing aids inside were fully charged. It takes about three hours to get a full charge and under normal use, that full charge is supposed to last about 20 hours, depending on how you’ve set things up and how much you’ve used them. I prefer rechargeable hearing aids like these over the type that require installing special batteries, but that’s a personal preference. I find that it’s much easier to locate an outlet to plug the charging case into than it is to find a store that sells the special batteries that some hearing aids operate on.

These hearing aids come with multiple size ear domes (four each of small, medium, and large sizes) and six slim tubes (two each of sizes 1, 2 and 3) to help make sure you get the best fit. 

While you may have to try on the different ear domes to decide which one gives you the best fit, there’s a measuring guide for both the right and left ear that lets you know which of the three slim tubes is the appropriate size without you having to try each of them on. However, you may find that the ones pre-installed on the hearing aids work just fine for you. That’s what happened in our case.

While some similar devices use a phone app to control and adjust the various settings, these hearing aids don’t require any outside devices to control things. Instead, it has four built-in preset programs that you can choose from by simply toggling between them, using the built-in buttons located on the rear of the hearing aids. And then, the next time you use the hearing aids, it remembers and uses the last program and settings you used.

Once setup is complete and you’ve got your settings where you want them, the real test comes when you’re ready to try out these hearing aids under multiple conditions. My wife, who suffers from moderate hearing loss, used these under different conditions and found that they work well at improving her everyday listening. Her only initial problem was trying to remember what all the different presses of the control buttons on the rear of the hearing aids do. To help her with that, I made her a “cheat sheet” copy from the user’s manual. And I can also confirm that these hearing aids seem to be working well, since I no longer hear “What did you say?” whenever I speak to her.

And finally, it’s good to know that they come with a one-year warranty on both parts and labor.

Over-the-counter hearing aids are here to stay, and these Go Ultra OTC hearing aids could certainly be a good choice for those who prefer the behind-the-ear style."
88,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,"Go Ultra, Go Comfort!","These Go Ultra OTC Hearing Aids from Go Hearing have actually surprised me in a good way.  I initially thought because I wear glasses, I needed hearing aids that weren’t over-the-ear.  I was wrong.  If I simply put in the new Go Ultras first and then my glasses, I may get an initial clanking noise (not if I’m careful) when the temple bars of my glasses makes contact with the body of the aids, but that’s it for the rest of the day.  Cool.  And since we’re on the topic of comfort, these are SO much more comfortable than an all-in-the-ear-canal micro-aid I’ve also given a try…and much less, if any, feedback.  Wearing them all day doesn’t seem to cause any irritation/discomfort that I’ve experienced in the past. 

Let’s talk about being inconspicuous.  My silvery white hair flows ever-so-gracefully down to the top and around the back of my ears.  (I paid a lot for these highlights!)  I wore the new set of Go Ultra aids all day and no one in my family noticed them.  I had to point them out.

Charging case — These aids are so much more flexible to live with on a daily basis because they are rechargeable.  I hate having to change out hearing aid batteries, and their cost, and their disposal, etc., etc.  With the Go Ultras, you don’t have to worry about that.

These aids come with a plethora of different sized ear plugs, tubes, and cleaning tools.  All good.  I’ll advise you now to be patient when going through the setup and sizing.  It takes time and some experimentation.  You may become frustrated at first, but once you find the magic fit, you’re set.  It’s worth the little bit of hassle at the outset.

There are a couple things I wish were different —

First, when going through the setup, if you find that you need a different sized tube, you may find it difficult to turn and separate the tube from the main body of the hearing aid.  I finally got it, but it wasn’t easy.  Do NOT pull on the tube itself.  Follow the instructions (which I thought were pretty well written by someone who seemed to have a decent grasp of the English language.  That’s rare these days).  The silicone buds were much easier to deal with — and they give you two styles, open and closed.  Since I have one ear much worse than the other, I’ve actually gone with the closed style on my bad side, and open on the other.  Nice to have the option.

That last thing that bothers me a bit is the battery life when using a bluetooth connection.  It’s awesome that you can connect with your phone to make or answer calls, or stream music.  But doing so quickly uses battery power.  You can go from lasting all day (10-12 hrs just as a hearing aid), to lasting 3-4 hours if you’re constantly streaming or talking on the phone.  I’ve found it easier for me to simply pull the Go Ultra bud out of my ear and talk on the phone as I normally would.  Using the speakerphone works, as well (as is the hands-free phone in the car.)

If you're considering trying some OTC before spending thousands, Go Ultra is worth the try.  If they work for you, like they do for me, it can be life-changing."
88,BestBuy,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,Comfortable,"This pair of hearing aids are comfortable for me to wear and the style I prefer.  Personally I prefer those around to know that I do have hearing loss.  Using ones that go in the ear (like earbuds) I get questioned at work with them and have to explain they are hearing aids.  I also have a lump in my left ear wear those sit and so they are always coming out.  With this style, they are behind my ear and then they have the part that goes directly into the ear canal.  They don’t come out as easy and if they do, they are still held in place and don’t fall to the ground.  I also like that they were easy to connect to phone and you can use these as hearing aides but also to listen to apps like YouTube and to take calls.  However, that is it for me as far as positive things. 

Sound quality was super quiet for me.  And even worse if they did come out even a little. I felt I could hear more without these.  All of the other hearing aids I have get much louder.  These do not have an app to adjust settings as well.  I was hoping that because they are made by Lexie that the Lexie app would work but it did not.  An app would have been nice to do a simple test for each ear and then adjust them from that.  As well as just to adjust in general.  This is a bigger deal for me as what good are hearing aids is you can’t hear with them.

The case is a bit bulky as well, but I like that they are rechargeable and the case acts like a battery back up to charge them.  The cord though could be a little longer as it’s short.  

These I give a 2 star just for the comfort and because they were easy to connect and when connected they allow you to use with apps."
88,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Improved my hearing and it streams !,"I have used other OTC hearing aids and I find these to be far superior. 

Out of the box the hearing aids performed perfectly. You must read he included user manual to check for proper fitting and the purpose of the two push buttons. The only thing I changed was the dome and I changed it to small. I did not have to change the slim tubes but two others of different lengths are included in the box. Medium and large domes are included in the package along with a cleaning tool. 

The is no APP. The units have 4 preset settings, Normal to boost all sounds, high-frequency boost, low frequency boost and General which the manual said is for steaming music. My particular hearing loss requires a high-frequency boost and this setting works just fine for me. I vary the volume as necessary depending on my environment.

 When paired with my Android phone I am able to answer calls and actually hear the person and the callers hear me just fine. I can also stream music and it sounds great. My other OTC hearing aids ( which cost more )  do not have any streaming either for music or phone calls. It has been my experience that constant streaming music and talking on phone will reduce battery life to around 3-4 hours. Normal use will last all day. I charge them at night. 

Left and right hearing aids can be adjusted separately for volume and the 4 sound presets directly from the device. Again, no APP is provided or needed. That is not possible with my current OTC hearing aids that require an internet connection to make significant parameter changes. Again, a big plus for this product.

The units were charged upon arrival. The very odd thing is the charging case. The case has a battery that allows me to charge the hearing aids  around 3 times without having it plugged in. That is very convenient  In order to recharge the case battery you must connect the charging cable to the bottom of the case so you have to lay it on its side. How can such a well thought out product have this, in my opinion, design flaw. There are LED’s on the case that provide status of the hearing aid battery and the charging case battery. 

The streaming is a game changer. I no longer have to put up with feedback when holding my phone up to my ear with my other OTC hearing aids. I can not go back to my other OTC hearing aids. I have been spoiled with this great product, it has far exceeded my expectations for an OTC hearing aid."

Off set on the bottom of the hearing aid are the two charging contacts. The hearing aids fit at an angle in the charger. There are two push buttons on the hearing aid, The button closest to the slim tube is multi-function button A, the other button is multi-function button B. Next to button A is the microphone.
The hearing aids have 4 preprogrammed settings. These are utilized by selecting the multi-function button B. 
The charging case has 3 led lights; the center is for the case and the others for each hearing aid. Blue for charging and green for charged. I found that if the light does not illuminate the earpiece is not correctly mounted. 
After initial charging set-up one took a few minutes. The hearing aids are light weight and did not cause any discomfort during prolonged use. After adjusting the sound level to my liking, I was done with the set-up. I wore the hearing aids for 10 hours doing normal everyday things. The next day I put them back in and forgot they were there. 
The Go Ultra Hearing Aids are Bluetooth enabled. You can pair them to your phone or device. It was a strange feeling pairing to the phone, as I could hear the phone in both ears. This made the conversation easier to follow as I have better hearing in one ear than the other.
The Go Ultra Hearing Aids also have built in noise reduction. Battery life is expected to be 20 hours without Bluetooth. With Bluetooth enabled by not in use you can get about 8 hours. Streaming cuts it down to 2.5 to 3 hours. To fully charge the batteries place them back in the case and it takes up to 3 hours to recharge.
The Go Ultra Hearing Aids comes with a 45-day return policy. Try them and you will love them."
88,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Go Hearing - Go Ultra OTC Hearing Aids,"So I received my Go Hearing - Go Ultra OTC Hearing Aids about a week ago and have been putting them through their paces. Now I have not been properly diagnosed with any type of hearing loss, though, I have known myself for awhile that my dominant ear is my right ear, which means there has to be some hearing loss in my left ear.

Upon opening the box, you will find:

* Go Hearing Go Ultra OTC Hearing Aids (1 pair: Left & Right)
* Charging Case with Charging Cable & Adaptor
* Open Domes (2 Small, 2 Medium, and 2 Large)
* Closed Domes (2 Small, 2 Medium, and 2 Large)
* Slim Tube (2 Small, 2 Medium, and 2 Large)
* Cleaning Wire
* Cleaning Brush
* Ear Measurement Tool
* User Manual

To get  started, simply follow along with the User Manual. It's best to ensure the hearing aids are fully charged before using them. Once fully charged, these hearing aids are really to pair and connect with your smartphone. Something I noticed right off the bat is that there was no app to download, install, and create a user profile. I like that. It's simply hold to power them on and pair them through your bluetooth settings in your phone or other mobile device as you would any other bluetooth device. Using the included ear measurement tool will help with ensure you have the right sized slim tube. The tubes are a little hard to remove and replace, though with a little patience you should be able to remove the old slim tube and connect the right tube for proper fitting. After installing the correct slim tube, now you can replace the ear domes and choose from whether you prefer open domes or the closed domes. The closed domes seemed to work better for me. Your mileage may vary.

After proper fit and installation of the proper slim tubes and domes, you're ready to go. Initially i found the sound to be very teeny until I got the correct tubes and domes installed and was able to hear much better and clearer. And they feel wonderful in my ears. Each hearing aid works independent of one another, which is something that I absolutely love. I can wear the right one and keep the left one charged or vice versa. Or wear both of them at the same time. 

A couple of great features that I love about the Go Ultra OTC hearing aids aside from them working independent of one another, is the fact that they stream music flawlessly without any issue. Calls were clear and not muffled like I've had on other more expensive hearing aid sets. One thing I would like to see, is an easier way to remove the slim wires, it took me a few minutes to remove these, but I managed. Other than that they are a decent budget pair of hearing aids that I will use."
88,BestBuy,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,You get what you pay for,"Made by Lexie, the Go Ultra is a pair of simple to use, relatively inexpensive, over-the-counter (OTC) hearing aids, but they are hearing aids with some major drawbacks.

The units are reasonably sized for OTC rechargeables, and are very lightweight. Much like earbuds, they have a charging case that serves as a battery pack for charging the hearing aids. The case itself is charged using a standard USB-C cable. A single charge to the Go Ultra will last about 22 hours, according to the company.

Setup is relatively simple, following the pattern of most over-the-ear, OTC hearing aids. For physical fit, you use a sizer to determine the proper length of wire and select the appropriate dome. Each hearing aid has a power button that doubles as volume up and a program select button that doubles as a sound profile selector. And those rudimentary settings are part of the problem with the Go Ultra. Each hearing aid is adjusted individually, and they remember your previous settings between charges.

Everyone has a hearing profile, where certain frequencies are diminished and others are clear. A hearing test, either on your phone, on-line, or through an audiologist, will help you determine your profile. But the Go Ultra doesn't have any of these tests, but instead uses a rather crude series of sound profiles; normal, high frequency, low frequency, and high gain (like normal, but with additional volume boosting). If, like me, you have low and high frequency loss, there is no setting that works properly. In fact, it’s hard to imagine who has hearing loss that matches these broad settings. It’s like trying to paint trim with a roller.

The Go Ultra will connect via Bluetooth, and connection is simple. You can then stream music and take calls, although no one is going to confuse these with quality earbuds. It also appears that the streaming sound is not impacted by the selected sound profile. If you have trouble hearing high frequencies in your music, you will still have issues hearing high frequencies in your music.

But, the main purpose of any hearing aid is to help your hearing, and this is where I had real issues with the Go Ultra. Voices, rustling paper, and other common sounds were harsh and artificial sounding. In fact, so long as the volume of the person speaking was not too soft I could hear conversations better unaided than with these. My own voice was abnormally amplified. I have worn a single hearing aid for about a decade, and this is the first time I’ve experienced this. Sounds were also slightly delayed. With two hearing aids in things weren’t overly bad, but with one in there was a ricochet effect, where the unassisted ear heard things a fraction of a second earlier than the aided ear. Most likely the effect of a slow processor in the hearing aids, t was, at best, distracting.

Most people are probably going to be a lot better off with something else. Yes, a better set will undoubtably cost quite a bit more, but sometimes you really do get exactly what you pay for."
88,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Go Hearing's Ultra OTC Hearing Aids Are Quite Good,"I received a pair of Go Hearing - Go Ultra OTC Hearing Aids to use, test and review with the review to be posted on Best Buy's website.

As I am very hard of hearing and also have tinnitus, I was very interested in Go Hearing's latest product as, to date, I have not found the perfect pair of hearing aids for my hearing condition and have not been fully satisfied with any of them I've tried before. 

The grey-colored Go Hearing Ultra OTC Hearing Aids arrived nicely boxed, with a rechargeable case for the hearing aids to nest in. The case acts as a charging station so no batteries are needed. These hearing aids are designed for use not, only to hear better, but also allow Buetooth connecction with smarphones allowing listening to digital music, podcasts and acceptance of phones calls while wearing. The Go Hearing Ultra are considerably less expensive than most prescription hearing aids with more features than many.

The Go Hearing Ultra Hearing Aids are grey in color and sit behind each ear making them somewhat inconspicuous. The fit via clear plastic tubing into your ear canal and come packaged with a number of different size in-ear buds to allow the user to find the perfect fit for their ears. Volume controls and a button to accept phone calls is positioned on the behind-ear hearing aid units making it easy and convenient to control the use of the hearing aids.

I only have one issue with the Go Hearing Ultra hearing aids - the inability to adjust the sound quality - treble, medium and bass. Other than that these are very good hearing aid units for the price!"
88,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Work Well and Easy to Use,"Reading through the included manual it does not tell me to install an app.  WooHoo!  A product that doesn’t need an app to work.  I plugged them in to charge.  Turns out they are shipped with a bit of paper covering the contacts!  So be sure to remove the paper from the contacts on each earpiece before charging!  Being used to an earbud style for any type of device in my ear, I was a bit nervous about putting the earpiece into my ear.  The directions said to hold your ear and pull it straight with your other hand to help insert the earpiece.  That technique worked great.  Once they are in your ears you don’t realize they are there.  I know they work because I only have to turn the television to one third the volume I do when I’m not wearing them.  Connecting to my phone was easy.  In the Bluetooth area the “Go Ultra” device simply showed up.  (The hearing aids were on and in my ears when I did this).  When making a phone call the Go Ultra device shows up on the phone just like “Speaker” so you can choose to use them for the phone call or not.  All in all, they work well and are easy to use.  The charging case charges even when it’s not plugged in (if the case has been charged) which is great for travel.  One item that takes a bit of getting used to is the retention wire that is used to help remove the dome from the ear.  If it sticks out too far, like it did when I first tried the hearing aids, then you need to insert the dome  into the ear.  Remember they are not earbuds!  I called customer service to inquire about the retention wire because it was sticking out past my ear.  I didn’t believe the recording when it said the wait time was 9 seconds.  The call was answered by a real person in about 3 seconds.  (Yes, I timed them).   Amazing in this day and age!"
88,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Nice to hear again!!,"I like my Go Ultra OTC hearing aids! I can hear better. Still adjusting to all the different things I can hear that I couldn't before. They have blutooth! That's nice! I can watch videos or listen to music without bothering anyone with loud volume. The only thing I don't like is while blutooth is active I can still hear everything else. It's not what I thought. It's not really a bad thing. Just threw me off at first. If you know you don't hear well, I recommend them!!"

88,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Bid Improvement,Took a little bit to tune in but that’s due to me. Very pleased to be able to hear again. My hearing is terrible and these hearing aids have made a big difference. Only problem I have is having to buy batteries since I didn’t purchase 250.00 charging unit
88,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Go Ultra OTC Hearing Aids,"I received the Go Hearing, Go Ultra OTC Hearing Aids in Gray. They seem to be well made and durable. They are comfortable to wear, don't fall out easily. I don't think they are right for my situation though, as I had a lot of whistling noises and my own voice was very amplified. I only have hearing loss in one ear.

Now I let my mother try them as she has more hearing loss than I do in both ears, and she said they were very clear, no noises or voice amplified and worked just as good as the ones she uses regularly.

Go Ultra hearing aids come in a nicely designed box with a compact recharge case that could easily fit in a bag or purse, it includes your hearing aids, an instruction manual, and several different tube lengths and dome tips.

Go Ultra comes with rechargeable batteries and allows 20 hours of battery life per charge.
allows Bluetooth streaming to iPhone and Android devices, does not allow customization to your specific hearing loss. Instead, the device has four pre-set programs, does not have a smartphone app. All adjustments are made through buttons on the back of the device.

Go Ultra has two buttons on each device. Here is a quick rundown of what each button does. 
Top Button - a 3-second press turns the hearing aids on and off a quick press and release increases the volume 
Bottom button - a 3-second press changes programs, a quick press and release decrease the volume, a quick press and release accepts or ends phone calls.

Go Ultra is worth a look if you are on a tight budget, have mild-moderate hearing loss, and need a device for simple listening situations like TV-watching."
88,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Very comfortable and work well,"These hearing aids work well and are very comfortable.  Setup is straightforward.  Out of the box, the first thing to do is charge them, which takes about three hours in the included charging case.  When I charged mine, they were ready to go in less than an hour.

The charging case holds the two aids only one way, so inserting them is no problem, and the case itself is charged along with the aids when plugged into the wall.  The case itself can then be used to charge the aids up to three time (according to the manual) if you’re away from a wall outlet.

To set up the aids for your ears, you begin by using the included “ear measuring tool,” which is a piece of L-shaped cardboard that hangs over your ear and measures the distance from the top of the location where your ear attaches to your head to the top of your ear canal.  The range of measurements is “1,” “2,” or “3,” and I am a 3.  The result of this measurement determines which of the three “ear tubes” you attach to the aids.

You then select the desired “ear dome” that attaches to the side of the aid that is inserted in your ear.  There are two types of domes, “open” and “closed,” where the choice depends on the type of results you want to experience.  The open dome is for more “natural” sound, while the closed dome emphasizes the bass registers, according to the manual.  Each dome type comes in three sizes. I use the open domes.

Inserting the aids in your ears is simple as they can go in only one way. Slide the top part of the aid (with the two control buttons) over your ear, insert the other end into your ear, and hook the little plastic wire attached to the aid around inside your outer ear to brace the aid in place.  I have found these aids, after three day of use, to be so comfortable that I forget that they’re there.  Wearing a pair of glasses over them is no issue at all.

The aids are turned on by a three-second press of one of the two buttons on each one.  The devices will say “power on,” and you’re off and running.  There are ten volume settings that you select by pressing the volume-up or volume-down buttons one step at a time.  After each press, the aids beep once to indicate that a new volume level has been selected.  When you reach the maximum or minimum, they beep three times.  I find that setting the volume levels at about the half-way point is best for me.  At the higher volume levels, the sound can be quite loud and shrill.

My hearing loss is considered mild and is concentrated at the higher frequencies. I also have been finding it more difficult to hear conversations in a noisy room.  So far, after three days of use, I’m finding it much easier to hear what’s going on around me.

In addition to acting as hearing aids, these units also feature Bluetooth capability, and they can be paired with your smartphone or any Bluetooth device.  Pairing them with my phone was a snap, and I can now both listen to music or whatever over my hearing aids as well as hearing the person I’m speaking with on a phone call.  

People with hearing aids are precluded from using earbuds because both need to be inserted into the ear to use, and there is room, obviously, for only one.  The combined capability of these aids neatly solves this problem. The one drawback to using the Bluetooth feature is that it greatly shortens the battery life.  I’ve not had a chance to test this, but the manual says that, without using Bluetooth, the batteries should last about 20 hours between charges.  When using Bluetooth, that drops to eight hours.

The box includes thin cleaning wires which are used to clean the ear tubes should the become clogged with wax.  I recommend keeping these handy as I have already needed them once.

Overall, I strongly recommend that anyone with mild hearing loss give these a try."

88,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Very happy,"So after getting about a week of use to give a fair and balanced review and opinion of these hearing aids there are some goods and only one real bad that i can find. Now i have a second set of hearing aids and i will not go into those but i'm kind of using those as a reference for these new ones i got. So first these come with a built in charger and when you put them in there case for the night you have a fully charged set,so you save some money because you do not need to buy hearing aid batteries and that's a big plus with these. My other ones you need to replace the batteries and they only last about two days of constant use. The sound quality is outstanding and also you do not need to have them set up with bluetooth with your phone unless you are going to stream music with them also then you need to set them up via bluetooth but not a big deal but it's nice if your picking them up only as hearing aids. I'll be honest with you the big appeal of these was the fact i can use them to stream music at work vs having my hearing aid and a set of earbuds also on me. I can use them as my go to hearing aids and earbuds for music and that is a very nice plus. But and you know there is always a but and that is if you use them only as hearing aids the battery life is great like 20 hours plus but if you stream with them it knocks the battery life down to about 4 hours. Bluetooth is very demanding for power and i know there is another way you can stream with earbuds a setting that they have to come with and it hooks up but not bluetooth and unfortunately these don't have them. It's not a big deal for me because i only listen to music for about 2 hours so by the time i am able to listen to them there is still a lot of battery power left. So al in all im am super happy with them. The streaming volume is not as loud as earbuds are but it's loud enough to stream your music."
88,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Comfortable and discreet,"I have been using the go hearing go uktra for a few weeks now and have loved the comfort of them. They are lightweight and fit really well in my ear and around it. Unlike others these dont irritate or bother me when wearing them for long periods of time. These come as a set, they come with a charging case with cable and adapter, open and closed domes as well as slim tubes. I love that the tubes are very discreet and are barely noticeable when wearing. As someone whose self consious of having to wear a hearing aid, this was my favorite feature. I love that it comes with a charging case because every night i can put them in the case to charge and not risk losing them or misplacing them. I can use them all day on one charge which is very convenient for me as im constantly on the go! I also love that i am able to stream calls, music, and even my social medias while wearing them! I have been able to hear great with these and they have helped tremendously with my hearing when i need it. Overall i highly reccomend the gonhearing go ultra hearing aids because they are comfortable and discreet and provide you the hearing that you deserve to have!"
88,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Improved hearing at a reasonable price point,"Go Hearing - Go Ultra OTC Hearing Aids – Gray

It’s certainly reassuring when the first thing you see when you open the box on these over-the-counter hearing aids is a blue card stating “Need Assistance? We’re here to help.” Included on that card is a phone number and web site URL where you can go for expert assistance. That’s a nice and welcome touch, since you usually need to go digging around for that information on many other products when you need help.

At first glance, the 48-page Go Ultra OTC hearing aid user manual seemed like a lot to digest. However, once I started reading through it, I realized that it was taking me, step-by-step, though the setup and use of these hearing aids. When I finished reading it, I felt that I had a very good understanding of the product, so I didn’t have to wonder how things worked. Very impressive and comforting! 

The unit comes with a portable charging/carrying/storage case which was already partially charged upon arrival. In less than an hour, I had three green lights, indicating that the charging unit itself and the two hearing aids inside were fully charged. It takes about three hours to get a full charge and under normal use, that full charge is supposed to last about 20 hours, depending on how you’ve set things up and how much you’ve used them. I prefer rechargeable hearing aids like these over the type that require installing special batteries, but that’s a personal preference. I find that it’s much easier to locate an outlet to plug the charging case into than it is to find a store that sells the special batteries that some hearing aids operate on.

These hearing aids come with multiple size ear domes (four each of small, medium, and large sizes) and six slim tubes (two each of sizes 1, 2 and 3) to help make sure you get the best fit. 

While you may have to try on the different ear domes to decide which one gives you the best fit, there’s a measuring guide for both the right and left ear that lets you know which of the three slim tubes is the appropriate size without you having to try each of them on. However, you may find that the ones pre-installed on the hearing aids work just fine for you. That’s what happened in our case.

While some similar devices use a phone app to control and adjust the various settings, these hearing aids don’t require any outside devices to control things. Instead, it has four built-in preset programs that you can choose from by simply toggling between them, using the built-in buttons located on the rear of the hearing aids. And then, the next time you use the hearing aids, it remembers and uses the last program and settings you used.

Once setup is complete and you’ve got your settings where you want them, the real test comes when you’re ready to try out these hearing aids under multiple conditions. My wife, who suffers from moderate hearing loss, used these under different conditions and found that they work well at improving her everyday listening. Her only initial problem was trying to remember what all the different presses of the control buttons on the rear of the hearing aids do. To help her with that, I made her a “cheat sheet” copy from the user’s manual. And I can also confirm that these hearing aids seem to be working well, since I no longer hear “What did you say?” whenever I speak to her.

And finally, it’s good to know that they come with a one-year warranty on both parts and labor.

Over-the-counter hearing aids are here to stay, and these Go Ultra OTC hearing aids could certainly be a good choice for those who prefer the behind-the-ear style."
88,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,"Go Ultra, Go Comfort!","These Go Ultra OTC Hearing Aids from Go Hearing have actually surprised me in a good way.  I initially thought because I wear glasses, I needed hearing aids that weren’t over-the-ear.  I was wrong.  If I simply put in the new Go Ultras first and then my glasses, I may get an initial clanking noise (not if I’m careful) when the temple bars of my glasses makes contact with the body of the aids, but that’s it for the rest of the day.  Cool.  And since we’re on the topic of comfort, these are SO much more comfortable than an all-in-the-ear-canal micro-aid I’ve also given a try…and much less, if any, feedback.  Wearing them all day doesn’t seem to cause any irritation/discomfort that I’ve experienced in the past. 

Let’s talk about being inconspicuous.  My silvery white hair flows ever-so-gracefully down to the top and around the back of my ears.  (I paid a lot for these highlights!)  I wore the new set of Go Ultra aids all day and no one in my family noticed them.  I had to point them out.

Charging case — These aids are so much more flexible to live with on a daily basis because they are rechargeable.  I hate having to change out hearing aid batteries, and their cost, and their disposal, etc., etc.  With the Go Ultras, you don’t have to worry about that.

These aids come with a plethora of different sized ear plugs, tubes, and cleaning tools.  All good.  I’ll advise you now to be patient when going through the setup and sizing.  It takes time and some experimentation.  You may become frustrated at first, but once you find the magic fit, you’re set.  It’s worth the little bit of hassle at the outset.

There are a couple things I wish were different —

First, when going through the setup, if you find that you need a different sized tube, you may find it difficult to turn and separate the tube from the main body of the hearing aid.  I finally got it, but it wasn’t easy.  Do NOT pull on the tube itself.  Follow the instructions (which I thought were pretty well written by someone who seemed to have a decent grasp of the English language.  That’s rare these days).  The silicone buds were much easier to deal with — and they give you two styles, open and closed.  Since I have one ear much worse than the other, I’ve actually gone with the closed style on my bad side, and open on the other.  Nice to have the option.

That last thing that bothers me a bit is the battery life when using a bluetooth connection.  It’s awesome that you can connect with your phone to make or answer calls, or stream music.  But doing so quickly uses battery power.  You can go from lasting all day (10-12 hrs just as a hearing aid), to lasting 3-4 hours if you’re constantly streaming or talking on the phone.  I’ve found it easier for me to simply pull the Go Ultra bud out of my ear and talk on the phone as I normally would.  Using the speakerphone works, as well (as is the hands-free phone in the car.)

If you're considering trying some OTC before spending thousands, Go Ultra is worth the try.  If they work for you, like they do for me, it can be life-changing."
88,BestBuy,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,Comfortable,"This pair of hearing aids are comfortable for me to wear and the style I prefer.  Personally I prefer those around to know that I do have hearing loss.  Using ones that go in the ear (like earbuds) I get questioned at work with them and have to explain they are hearing aids.  I also have a lump in my left ear wear those sit and so they are always coming out.  With this style, they are behind my ear and then they have the part that goes directly into the ear canal.  They don’t come out as easy and if they do, they are still held in place and don’t fall to the ground.  I also like that they were easy to connect to phone and you can use these as hearing aides but also to listen to apps like YouTube and to take calls.  However, that is it for me as far as positive things. 

Sound quality was super quiet for me.  And even worse if they did come out even a little. I felt I could hear more without these.  All of the other hearing aids I have get much louder.  These do not have an app to adjust settings as well.  I was hoping that because they are made by Lexie that the Lexie app would work but it did not.  An app would have been nice to do a simple test for each ear and then adjust them from that.  As well as just to adjust in general.  This is a bigger deal for me as what good are hearing aids is you can’t hear with them.

The case is a bit bulky as well, but I like that they are rechargeable and the case acts like a battery back up to charge them.  The cord though could be a little longer as it’s short.  

These I give a 2 star just for the comfort and because they were easy to connect and when connected they allow you to use with apps."
88,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Improved my hearing and it streams !,"I have used other OTC hearing aids and I find these to be far superior. 

Out of the box the hearing aids performed perfectly. You must read he included user manual to check for proper fitting and the purpose of the two push buttons. The only thing I changed was the dome and I changed it to small. I did not have to change the slim tubes but two others of different lengths are included in the box. Medium and large domes are included in the package along with a cleaning tool. 

The is no APP. The units have 4 preset settings, Normal to boost all sounds, high-frequency boost, low frequency boost and General which the manual said is for steaming music. My particular hearing loss requires a high-frequency boost and this setting works just fine for me. I vary the volume as necessary depending on my environment.

 When paired with my Android phone I am able to answer calls and actually hear the person and the callers hear me just fine. I can also stream music and it sounds great. My other OTC hearing aids ( which cost more )  do not have any streaming either for music or phone calls. It has been my experience that constant streaming music and talking on phone will reduce battery life to around 3-4 hours. Normal use will last all day. I charge them at night. 

Left and right hearing aids can be adjusted separately for volume and the 4 sound presets directly from the device. Again, no APP is provided or needed. That is not possible with my current OTC hearing aids that require an internet connection to make significant parameter changes. Again, a big plus for this product.

The units were charged upon arrival. The very odd thing is the charging case. The case has a battery that allows me to charge the hearing aids  around 3 times without having it plugged in. That is very convenient  In order to recharge the case battery you must connect the charging cable to the bottom of the case so you have to lay it on its side. How can such a well thought out product have this, in my opinion, design flaw. There are LED’s on the case that provide status of the hearing aid battery and the charging case battery. 

The streaming is a game changer. I no longer have to put up with feedback when holding my phone up to my ear with my other OTC hearing aids. I can not go back to my other OTC hearing aids. I have been spoiled with this great product, it has far exceeded my expectations for an OTC hearing aid."

The hearing aids have 4 preprogrammed settings. These are utilized by selecting the multi-function button B. 
The charging case has 3 led lights; the center is for the case and the others for each hearing aid. Blue for charging and green for charged. I found that if the light does not illuminate the earpiece is not correctly mounted. 
After initial charging set-up one took a few minutes. The hearing aids are light weight and did not cause any discomfort during prolonged use. After adjusting the sound level to my liking, I was done with the set-up. I wore the hearing aids for 10 hours doing normal everyday things. The next day I put them back in and forgot they were there. 
The Go Ultra Hearing Aids are Bluetooth enabled. You can pair them to your phone or device. It was a strange feeling pairing to the phone, as I could hear the phone in both ears. This made the conversation easier to follow as I have better hearing in one ear than the other.
The Go Ultra Hearing Aids also have built in noise reduction. Battery life is expected to be 20 hours without Bluetooth. With Bluetooth enabled by not in use you can get about 8 hours. Streaming cuts it down to 2.5 to 3 hours. To fully charge the batteries place them back in the case and it takes up to 3 hours to recharge.
The Go Ultra Hearing Aids comes with a 45-day return policy. Try them and you will love them."
88,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Go Hearing - Go Ultra OTC Hearing Aids,"So I received my Go Hearing - Go Ultra OTC Hearing Aids about a week ago and have been putting them through their paces. Now I have not been properly diagnosed with any type of hearing loss, though, I have known myself for awhile that my dominant ear is my right ear, which means there has to be some hearing loss in my left ear.

Upon opening the box, you will find:

* Go Hearing Go Ultra OTC Hearing Aids (1 pair: Left & Right)
* Charging Case with Charging Cable & Adaptor
* Open Domes (2 Small, 2 Medium, and 2 Large)
* Closed Domes (2 Small, 2 Medium, and 2 Large)
* Slim Tube (2 Small, 2 Medium, and 2 Large)
* Cleaning Wire
* Cleaning Brush
* Ear Measurement Tool
* User Manual

To get  started, simply follow along with the User Manual. It's best to ensure the hearing aids are fully charged before using them. Once fully charged, these hearing aids are really to pair and connect with your smartphone. Something I noticed right off the bat is that there was no app to download, install, and create a user profile. I like that. It's simply hold to power them on and pair them through your bluetooth settings in your phone or other mobile device as you would any other bluetooth device. Using the included ear measurement tool will help with ensure you have the right sized slim tube. The tubes are a little hard to remove and replace, though with a little patience you should be able to remove the old slim tube and connect the right tube for proper fitting. After installing the correct slim tube, now you can replace the ear domes and choose from whether you prefer open domes or the closed domes. The closed domes seemed to work better for me. Your mileage may vary.

After proper fit and installation of the proper slim tubes and domes, you're ready to go. Initially i found the sound to be very teeny until I got the correct tubes and domes installed and was able to hear much better and clearer. And they feel wonderful in my ears. Each hearing aid works independent of one another, which is something that I absolutely love. I can wear the right one and keep the left one charged or vice versa. Or wear both of them at the same time. 

A couple of great features that I love about the Go Ultra OTC hearing aids aside from them working independent of one another, is the fact that they stream music flawlessly without any issue. Calls were clear and not muffled like I've had on other more expensive hearing aid sets. One thing I would like to see, is an easier way to remove the slim wires, it took me a few minutes to remove these, but I managed. Other than that they are a decent budget pair of hearing aids that I will use."
88,BestBuy,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,You get what you pay for,"Made by Lexie, the Go Ultra is a pair of simple to use, relatively inexpensive, over-the-counter (OTC) hearing aids, but they are hearing aids with some major drawbacks.

The units are reasonably sized for OTC rechargeables, and are very lightweight. Much like earbuds, they have a charging case that serves as a battery pack for charging the hearing aids. The case itself is charged using a standard USB-C cable. A single charge to the Go Ultra will last about 22 hours, according to the company.

Setup is relatively simple, following the pattern of most over-the-ear, OTC hearing aids. For physical fit, you use a sizer to determine the proper length of wire and select the appropriate dome. Each hearing aid has a power button that doubles as volume up and a program select button that doubles as a sound profile selector. And those rudimentary settings are part of the problem with the Go Ultra. Each hearing aid is adjusted individually, and they remember your previous settings between charges.

Everyone has a hearing profile, where certain frequencies are diminished and others are clear. A hearing test, either on your phone, on-line, or through an audiologist, will help you determine your profile. But the Go Ultra doesn't have any of these tests, but instead uses a rather crude series of sound profiles; normal, high frequency, low frequency, and high gain (like normal, but with additional volume boosting). If, like me, you have low and high frequency loss, there is no setting that works properly. In fact, it’s hard to imagine who has hearing loss that matches these broad settings. It’s like trying to paint trim with a roller.

The Go Ultra will connect via Bluetooth, and connection is simple. You can then stream music and take calls, although no one is going to confuse these with quality earbuds. It also appears that the streaming sound is not impacted by the selected sound profile. If you have trouble hearing high frequencies in your music, you will still have issues hearing high frequencies in your music.

But, the main purpose of any hearing aid is to help your hearing, and this is where I had real issues with the Go Ultra. Voices, rustling paper, and other common sounds were harsh and artificial sounding. In fact, so long as the volume of the person speaking was not too soft I could hear conversations better unaided than with these. My own voice was abnormally amplified. I have worn a single hearing aid for about a decade, and this is the first time I’ve experienced this. Sounds were also slightly delayed. With two hearing aids in things weren’t overly bad, but with one in there was a ricochet effect, where the unassisted ear heard things a fraction of a second earlier than the aided ear. Most likely the effect of a slow processor in the hearing aids, t was, at best, distracting.

Most people are probably going to be a lot better off with something else. Yes, a better set will undoubtably cost quite a bit more, but sometimes you really do get exactly what you pay for."
88,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Go Hearing's Ultra OTC Hearing Aids Are Quite Good,"I received a pair of Go Hearing - Go Ultra OTC Hearing Aids to use, test and review with the review to be posted on Best Buy's website.

As I am very hard of hearing and also have tinnitus, I was very interested in Go Hearing's latest product as, to date, I have not found the perfect pair of hearing aids for my hearing condition and have not been fully satisfied with any of them I've tried before. 

The grey-colored Go Hearing Ultra OTC Hearing Aids arrived nicely boxed, with a rechargeable case for the hearing aids to nest in. The case acts as a charging station so no batteries are needed. These hearing aids are designed for use not, only to hear better, but also allow Buetooth connecction with smarphones allowing listening to digital music, podcasts and acceptance of phones calls while wearing. The Go Hearing Ultra are considerably less expensive than most prescription hearing aids with more features than many.

The Go Hearing Ultra Hearing Aids are grey in color and sit behind each ear making them somewhat inconspicuous. The fit via clear plastic tubing into your ear canal and come packaged with a number of different size in-ear buds to allow the user to find the perfect fit for their ears. Volume controls and a button to accept phone calls is positioned on the behind-ear hearing aid units making it easy and convenient to control the use of the hearing aids.

I only have one issue with the Go Hearing Ultra hearing aids - the inability to adjust the sound quality - treble, medium and bass. Other than that these are very good hearing aid units for the price!"
88,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Work Well and Easy to Use,"Reading through the included manual it does not tell me to install an app.  WooHoo!  A product that doesn’t need an app to work.  I plugged them in to charge.  Turns out they are shipped with a bit of paper covering the contacts!  So be sure to remove the paper from the contacts on each earpiece before charging!  Being used to an earbud style for any type of device in my ear, I was a bit nervous about putting the earpiece into my ear.  The directions said to hold your ear and pull it straight with your other hand to help insert the earpiece.  That technique worked great.  Once they are in your ears you don’t realize they are there.  I know they work because I only have to turn the television to one third the volume I do when I’m not wearing them.  Connecting to my phone was easy.  In the Bluetooth area the “Go Ultra” device simply showed up.  (The hearing aids were on and in my ears when I did this).  When making a phone call the Go Ultra device shows up on the phone just like “Speaker” so you can choose to use them for the phone call or not.  All in all, they work well and are easy to use.  The charging case charges even when it’s not plugged in (if the case has been charged) which is great for travel.  One item that takes a bit of getting used to is the retention wire that is used to help remove the dome from the ear.  If it sticks out too far, like it did when I first tried the hearing aids, then you need to insert the dome  into the ear.  Remember they are not earbuds!  I called customer service to inquire about the retention wire because it was sticking out past my ear.  I didn’t believe the recording when it said the wait time was 9 seconds.  The call was answered by a real person in about 3 seconds.  (Yes, I timed them).   Amazing in this day and age!"
88,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Nice to hear again!!,"I like my Go Ultra OTC hearing aids! I can hear better. Still adjusting to all the different things I can hear that I couldn't before. They have blutooth! That's nice! I can watch videos or listen to music without bothering anyone with loud volume. The only thing I don't like is while blutooth is active I can still hear everything else. It's not what I thought. It's not really a bad thing. Just threw me off at first. If you know you don't hear well, I recommend them!!"

88,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Bid Improvement,Took a little bit to tune in but that’s due to me. Very pleased to be able to hear again. My hearing is terrible and these hearing aids have made a big difference. Only problem I have is having to buy batteries since I didn’t purchase 250.00 charging unit
88,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Go Ultra OTC Hearing Aids,"I received the Go Hearing, Go Ultra OTC Hearing Aids in Gray. They seem to be well made and durable. They are comfortable to wear, don't fall out easily. I don't think they are right for my situation though, as I had a lot of whistling noises and my own voice was very amplified. I only have hearing loss in one ear.

Now I let my mother try them as she has more hearing loss than I do in both ears, and she said they were very clear, no noises or voice amplified and worked just as good as the ones she uses regularly.

Go Ultra hearing aids come in a nicely designed box with a compact recharge case that could easily fit in a bag or purse, it includes your hearing aids, an instruction manual, and several different tube lengths and dome tips.

Go Ultra comes with rechargeable batteries and allows 20 hours of battery life per charge.
allows Bluetooth streaming to iPhone and Android devices, does not allow customization to your specific hearing loss. Instead, the device has four pre-set programs, does not have a smartphone app. All adjustments are made through buttons on the back of the device.

Go Ultra has two buttons on each device. Here is a quick rundown of what each button does. 
Top Button - a 3-second press turns the hearing aids on and off a quick press and release increases the volume 
Bottom button - a 3-second press changes programs, a quick press and release decrease the volume, a quick press and release accepts or ends phone calls.

Go Ultra is worth a look if you are on a tight budget, have mild-moderate hearing loss, and need a device for simple listening situations like TV-watching."
88,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Very comfortable and work well,"These hearing aids work well and are very comfortable.  Setup is straightforward.  Out of the box, the first thing to do is charge them, which takes about three hours in the included charging case.  When I charged mine, they were ready to go in less than an hour.

The charging case holds the two aids only one way, so inserting them is no problem, and the case itself is charged along with the aids when plugged into the wall.  The case itself can then be used to charge the aids up to three time (according to the manual) if you’re away from a wall outlet.

To set up the aids for your ears, you begin by using the included “ear measuring tool,” which is a piece of L-shaped cardboard that hangs over your ear and measures the distance from the top of the location where your ear attaches to your head to the top of your ear canal.  The range of measurements is “1,” “2,” or “3,” and I am a 3.  The result of this measurement determines which of the three “ear tubes” you attach to the aids.

You then select the desired “ear dome” that attaches to the side of the aid that is inserted in your ear.  There are two types of domes, “open” and “closed,” where the choice depends on the type of results you want to experience.  The open dome is for more “natural” sound, while the closed dome emphasizes the bass registers, according to the manual.  Each dome type comes in three sizes. I use the open domes.

Inserting the aids in your ears is simple as they can go in only one way. Slide the top part of the aid (with the two control buttons) over your ear, insert the other end into your ear, and hook the little plastic wire attached to the aid around inside your outer ear to brace the aid in place.  I have found these aids, after three day of use, to be so comfortable that I forget that they’re there.  Wearing a pair of glasses over them is no issue at all.

The aids are turned on by a three-second press of one of the two buttons on each one.  The devices will say “power on,” and you’re off and running.  There are ten volume settings that you select by pressing the volume-up or volume-down buttons one step at a time.  After each press, the aids beep once to indicate that a new volume level has been selected.  When you reach the maximum or minimum, they beep three times.  I find that setting the volume levels at about the half-way point is best for me.  At the higher volume levels, the sound can be quite loud and shrill.

My hearing loss is considered mild and is concentrated at the higher frequencies. I also have been finding it more difficult to hear conversations in a noisy room.  So far, after three days of use, I’m finding it much easier to hear what’s going on around me.

In addition to acting as hearing aids, these units also feature Bluetooth capability, and they can be paired with your smartphone or any Bluetooth device.  Pairing them with my phone was a snap, and I can now both listen to music or whatever over my hearing aids as well as hearing the person I’m speaking with on a phone call.  

People with hearing aids are precluded from using earbuds because both need to be inserted into the ear to use, and there is room, obviously, for only one.  The combined capability of these aids neatly solves this problem. The one drawback to using the Bluetooth feature is that it greatly shortens the battery life.  I’ve not had a chance to test this, but the manual says that, without using Bluetooth, the batteries should last about 20 hours between charges.  When using Bluetooth, that drops to eight hours.

The box includes thin cleaning wires which are used to clean the ear tubes should the become clogged with wax.  I recommend keeping these handy as I have already needed them once.

Overall, I strongly recommend that anyone with mild hearing loss give these a try."

88,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Very happy,"So after getting about a week of use to give a fair and balanced review and opinion of these hearing aids there are some goods and only one real bad that i can find. Now i have a second set of hearing aids and i will not go into those but i'm kind of using those as a reference for these new ones i got. So first these come with a built in charger and when you put them in there case for the night you have a fully charged set,so you save some money because you do not need to buy hearing aid batteries and that's a big plus with these. My other ones you need to replace the batteries and they only last about two days of constant use. The sound quality is outstanding and also you do not need to have them set up with bluetooth with your phone unless you are going to stream music with them also then you need to set them up via bluetooth but not a big deal but it's nice if your picking them up only as hearing aids. I'll be honest with you the big appeal of these was the fact i can use them to stream music at work vs having my hearing aid and a set of earbuds also on me. I can use them as my go to hearing aids and earbuds for music and that is a very nice plus. But and you know there is always a but and that is if you use them only as hearing aids the battery life is great like 20 hours plus but if you stream with them it knocks the battery life down to about 4 hours. Bluetooth is very demanding for power and i know there is another way you can stream with earbuds a setting that they have to come with and it hooks up but not bluetooth and unfortunately these don't have them. It's not a big deal for me because i only listen to music for about 2 hours so by the time i am able to listen to them there is still a lot of battery power left. So al in all im am super happy with them. The streaming volume is not as loud as earbuds are but it's loud enough to stream your music."
88,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Comfortable and discreet,"I have been using the go hearing go uktra for a few weeks now and have loved the comfort of them. They are lightweight and fit really well in my ear and around it. Unlike others these dont irritate or bother me when wearing them for long periods of time. These come as a set, they come with a charging case with cable and adapter, open and closed domes as well as slim tubes. I love that the tubes are very discreet and are barely noticeable when wearing. As someone whose self consious of having to wear a hearing aid, this was my favorite feature. I love that it comes with a charging case because every night i can put them in the case to charge and not risk losing them or misplacing them. I can use them all day on one charge which is very convenient for me as im constantly on the go! I also love that i am able to stream calls, music, and even my social medias while wearing them! I have been able to hear great with these and they have helped tremendously with my hearing when i need it. Overall i highly reccomend the gonhearing go ultra hearing aids because they are comfortable and discreet and provide you the hearing that you deserve to have!"
88,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Improved hearing at a reasonable price point,"Go Hearing - Go Ultra OTC Hearing Aids – Gray

It’s certainly reassuring when the first thing you see when you open the box on these over-the-counter hearing aids is a blue card stating “Need Assistance? We’re here to help.” Included on that card is a phone number and web site URL where you can go for expert assistance. That’s a nice and welcome touch, since you usually need to go digging around for that information on many other products when you need help.

At first glance, the 48-page Go Ultra OTC hearing aid user manual seemed like a lot to digest. However, once I started reading through it, I realized that it was taking me, step-by-step, though the setup and use of these hearing aids. When I finished reading it, I felt that I had a very good understanding of the product, so I didn’t have to wonder how things worked. Very impressive and comforting! 

The unit comes with a portable charging/carrying/storage case which was already partially charged upon arrival. In less than an hour, I had three green lights, indicating that the charging unit itself and the two hearing aids inside were fully charged. It takes about three hours to get a full charge and under normal use, that full charge is supposed to last about 20 hours, depending on how you’ve set things up and how much you’ve used them. I prefer rechargeable hearing aids like these over the type that require installing special batteries, but that’s a personal preference. I find that it’s much easier to locate an outlet to plug the charging case into than it is to find a store that sells the special batteries that some hearing aids operate on.

These hearing aids come with multiple size ear domes (four each of small, medium, and large sizes) and six slim tubes (two each of sizes 1, 2 and 3) to help make sure you get the best fit. 

While you may have to try on the different ear domes to decide which one gives you the best fit, there’s a measuring guide for both the right and left ear that lets you know which of the three slim tubes is the appropriate size without you having to try each of them on. However, you may find that the ones pre-installed on the hearing aids work just fine for you. That’s what happened in our case.

While some similar devices use a phone app to control and adjust the various settings, these hearing aids don’t require any outside devices to control things. Instead, it has four built-in preset programs that you can choose from by simply toggling between them, using the built-in buttons located on the rear of the hearing aids. And then, the next time you use the hearing aids, it remembers and uses the last program and settings you used.

Once setup is complete and you’ve got your settings where you want them, the real test comes when you’re ready to try out these hearing aids under multiple conditions. My wife, who suffers from moderate hearing loss, used these under different conditions and found that they work well at improving her everyday listening. Her only initial problem was trying to remember what all the different presses of the control buttons on the rear of the hearing aids do. To help her with that, I made her a “cheat sheet” copy from the user’s manual. And I can also confirm that these hearing aids seem to be working well, since I no longer hear “What did you say?” whenever I speak to her.

And finally, it’s good to know that they come with a one-year warranty on both parts and labor.

Over-the-counter hearing aids are here to stay, and these Go Ultra OTC hearing aids could certainly be a good choice for those who prefer the behind-the-ear style."
88,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,"Go Ultra, Go Comfort!","These Go Ultra OTC Hearing Aids from Go Hearing have actually surprised me in a good way.  I initially thought because I wear glasses, I needed hearing aids that weren’t over-the-ear.  I was wrong.  If I simply put in the new Go Ultras first and then my glasses, I may get an initial clanking noise (not if I’m careful) when the temple bars of my glasses makes contact with the body of the aids, but that’s it for the rest of the day.  Cool.  And since we’re on the topic of comfort, these are SO much more comfortable than an all-in-the-ear-canal micro-aid I’ve also given a try…and much less, if any, feedback.  Wearing them all day doesn’t seem to cause any irritation/discomfort that I’ve experienced in the past. 

Let’s talk about being inconspicuous.  My silvery white hair flows ever-so-gracefully down to the top and around the back of my ears.  (I paid a lot for these highlights!)  I wore the new set of Go Ultra aids all day and no one in my family noticed them.  I had to point them out.

Charging case — These aids are so much more flexible to live with on a daily basis because they are rechargeable.  I hate having to change out hearing aid batteries, and their cost, and their disposal, etc., etc.  With the Go Ultras, you don’t have to worry about that.

These aids come with a plethora of different sized ear plugs, tubes, and cleaning tools.  All good.  I’ll advise you now to be patient when going through the setup and sizing.  It takes time and some experimentation.  You may become frustrated at first, but once you find the magic fit, you’re set.  It’s worth the little bit of hassle at the outset.

There are a couple things I wish were different —

First, when going through the setup, if you find that you need a different sized tube, you may find it difficult to turn and separate the tube from the main body of the hearing aid.  I finally got it, but it wasn’t easy.  Do NOT pull on the tube itself.  Follow the instructions (which I thought were pretty well written by someone who seemed to have a decent grasp of the English language.  That’s rare these days).  The silicone buds were much easier to deal with — and they give you two styles, open and closed.  Since I have one ear much worse than the other, I’ve actually gone with the closed style on my bad side, and open on the other.  Nice to have the option.

That last thing that bothers me a bit is the battery life when using a bluetooth connection.  It’s awesome that you can connect with your phone to make or answer calls, or stream music.  But doing so quickly uses battery power.  You can go from lasting all day (10-12 hrs just as a hearing aid), to lasting 3-4 hours if you’re constantly streaming or talking on the phone.  I’ve found it easier for me to simply pull the Go Ultra bud out of my ear and talk on the phone as I normally would.  Using the speakerphone works, as well (as is the hands-free phone in the car.)

If you're considering trying some OTC before spending thousands, Go Ultra is worth the try.  If they work for you, like they do for me, it can be life-changing."
88,BestBuy,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,Comfortable,"This pair of hearing aids are comfortable for me to wear and the style I prefer.  Personally I prefer those around to know that I do have hearing loss.  Using ones that go in the ear (like earbuds) I get questioned at work with them and have to explain they are hearing aids.  I also have a lump in my left ear wear those sit and so they are always coming out.  With this style, they are behind my ear and then they have the part that goes directly into the ear canal.  They don’t come out as easy and if they do, they are still held in place and don’t fall to the ground.  I also like that they were easy to connect to phone and you can use these as hearing aides but also to listen to apps like YouTube and to take calls.  However, that is it for me as far as positive things. 

Sound quality was super quiet for me.  And even worse if they did come out even a little. I felt I could hear more without these.  All of the other hearing aids I have get much louder.  These do not have an app to adjust settings as well.  I was hoping that because they are made by Lexie that the Lexie app would work but it did not.  An app would have been nice to do a simple test for each ear and then adjust them from that.  As well as just to adjust in general.  This is a bigger deal for me as what good are hearing aids is you can’t hear with them.

The case is a bit bulky as well, but I like that they are rechargeable and the case acts like a battery back up to charge them.  The cord though could be a little longer as it’s short.  

These I give a 2 star just for the comfort and because they were easy to connect and when connected they allow you to use with apps."
88,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Improved my hearing and it streams !,"I have used other OTC hearing aids and I find these to be far superior. 

Out of the box the hearing aids performed perfectly. You must read he included user manual to check for proper fitting and the purpose of the two push buttons. The only thing I changed was the dome and I changed it to small. I did not have to change the slim tubes but two others of different lengths are included in the box. Medium and large domes are included in the package along with a cleaning tool. 

The is no APP. The units have 4 preset settings, Normal to boost all sounds, high-frequency boost, low frequency boost and General which the manual said is for steaming music. My particular hearing loss requires a high-frequency boost and this setting works just fine for me. I vary the volume as necessary depending on my environment.

 When paired with my Android phone I am able to answer calls and actually hear the person and the callers hear me just fine. I can also stream music and it sounds great. My other OTC hearing aids ( which cost more )  do not have any streaming either for music or phone calls. It has been my experience that constant streaming music and talking on phone will reduce battery life to around 3-4 hours. Normal use will last all day. I charge them at night. 

Left and right hearing aids can be adjusted separately for volume and the 4 sound presets directly from the device. Again, no APP is provided or needed. That is not possible with my current OTC hearing aids that require an internet connection to make significant parameter changes. Again, a big plus for this product.

The units were charged upon arrival. The very odd thing is the charging case. The case has a battery that allows me to charge the hearing aids  around 3 times without having it plugged in. That is very convenient  In order to recharge the case battery you must connect the charging cable to the bottom of the case so you have to lay it on its side. How can such a well thought out product have this, in my opinion, design flaw. There are LED’s on the case that provide status of the hearing aid battery and the charging case battery. 

The streaming is a game changer. I no longer have to put up with feedback when holding my phone up to my ear with my other OTC hearing aids. I can not go back to my other OTC hearing aids. I have been spoiled with this great product, it has far exceeded my expectations for an OTC hearing aid."

The hearing aids have 4 preprogrammed settings. These are utilized by selecting the multi-function button B. 
The charging case has 3 led lights; the center is for the case and the others for each hearing aid. Blue for charging and green for charged. I found that if the light does not illuminate the earpiece is not correctly mounted. 
After initial charging set-up one took a few minutes. The hearing aids are light weight and did not cause any discomfort during prolonged use. After adjusting the sound level to my liking, I was done with the set-up. I wore the hearing aids for 10 hours doing normal everyday things. The next day I put them back in and forgot they were there. 
The Go Ultra Hearing Aids are Bluetooth enabled. You can pair them to your phone or device. It was a strange feeling pairing to the phone, as I could hear the phone in both ears. This made the conversation easier to follow as I have better hearing in one ear than the other.
The Go Ultra Hearing Aids also have built in noise reduction. Battery life is expected to be 20 hours without Bluetooth. With Bluetooth enabled by not in use you can get about 8 hours. Streaming cuts it down to 2.5 to 3 hours. To fully charge the batteries place them back in the case and it takes up to 3 hours to recharge.

88,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Go Hearing - Go Ultra OTC Hearing Aids,"So I received my Go Hearing - Go Ultra OTC Hearing Aids about a week ago and have been putting them through their paces. Now I have not been properly diagnosed with any type of hearing loss, though, I have known myself for awhile that my dominant ear is my right ear, which means there has to be some hearing loss in my left ear.

Upon opening the box, you will find:

* Go Hearing Go Ultra OTC Hearing Aids (1 pair: Left & Right)
* Charging Case with Charging Cable & Adaptor
* Open Domes (2 Small, 2 Medium, and 2 Large)
* Closed Domes (2 Small, 2 Medium, and 2 Large)
* Slim Tube (2 Small, 2 Medium, and 2 Large)
* Cleaning Wire
* Cleaning Brush
* Ear Measurement Tool
* User Manual

To get  started, simply follow along with the User Manual. It's best to ensure the hearing aids are fully charged before using them. Once fully charged, these hearing aids are really to pair and connect with your smartphone. Something I noticed right off the bat is that there was no app to download, install, and create a user profile. I like that. It's simply hold to power them on and pair them through your bluetooth settings in your phone or other mobile device as you would any other bluetooth device. Using the included ear measurement tool will help with ensure you have the right sized slim tube. The tubes are a little hard to remove and replace, though with a little patience you should be able to remove the old slim tube and connect the right tube for proper fitting. After installing the correct slim tube, now you can replace the ear domes and choose from whether you prefer open domes or the closed domes. The closed domes seemed to work better for me. Your mileage may vary.

After proper fit and installation of the proper slim tubes and domes, you're ready to go. Initially i found the sound to be very teeny until I got the correct tubes and domes installed and was able to hear much better and clearer. And they feel wonderful in my ears. Each hearing aid works independent of one another, which is something that I absolutely love. I can wear the right one and keep the left one charged or vice versa. Or wear both of them at the same time. 

A couple of great features that I love about the Go Ultra OTC hearing aids aside from them working independent of one another, is the fact that they stream music flawlessly without any issue. Calls were clear and not muffled like I've had on other more expensive hearing aid sets. One thing I would like to see, is an easier way to remove the slim wires, it took me a few minutes to remove these, but I managed. Other than that they are a decent budget pair of hearing aids that I will use."
88,BestBuy,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,You get what you pay for,"Made by Lexie, the Go Ultra is a pair of simple to use, relatively inexpensive, over-the-counter (OTC) hearing aids, but they are hearing aids with some major drawbacks.

The units are reasonably sized for OTC rechargeables, and are very lightweight. Much like earbuds, they have a charging case that serves as a battery pack for charging the hearing aids. The case itself is charged using a standard USB-C cable. A single charge to the Go Ultra will last about 22 hours, according to the company.

Setup is relatively simple, following the pattern of most over-the-ear, OTC hearing aids. For physical fit, you use a sizer to determine the proper length of wire and select the appropriate dome. Each hearing aid has a power button that doubles as volume up and a program select button that doubles as a sound profile selector. And those rudimentary settings are part of the problem with the Go Ultra. Each hearing aid is adjusted individually, and they remember your previous settings between charges.

Everyone has a hearing profile, where certain frequencies are diminished and others are clear. A hearing test, either on your phone, on-line, or through an audiologist, will help you determine your profile. But the Go Ultra doesn't have any of these tests, but instead uses a rather crude series of sound profiles; normal, high frequency, low frequency, and high gain (like normal, but with additional volume boosting). If, like me, you have low and high frequency loss, there is no setting that works properly. In fact, it’s hard to imagine who has hearing loss that matches these broad settings. It’s like trying to paint trim with a roller.

The Go Ultra will connect via Bluetooth, and connection is simple. You can then stream music and take calls, although no one is going to confuse these with quality earbuds. It also appears that the streaming sound is not impacted by the selected sound profile. If you have trouble hearing high frequencies in your music, you will still have issues hearing high frequencies in your music.

But, the main purpose of any hearing aid is to help your hearing, and this is where I had real issues with the Go Ultra. Voices, rustling paper, and other common sounds were harsh and artificial sounding. In fact, so long as the volume of the person speaking was not too soft I could hear conversations better unaided than with these. My own voice was abnormally amplified. I have worn a single hearing aid for about a decade, and this is the first time I’ve experienced this. Sounds were also slightly delayed. With two hearing aids in things weren’t overly bad, but with one in there was a ricochet effect, where the unassisted ear heard things a fraction of a second earlier than the aided ear. Most likely the effect of a slow processor in the hearing aids, t was, at best, distracting.

Most people are probably going to be a lot better off with something else. Yes, a better set will undoubtably cost quite a bit more, but sometimes you really do get exactly what you pay for."
88,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Go Hearing's Ultra OTC Hearing Aids Are Quite Good,"I received a pair of Go Hearing - Go Ultra OTC Hearing Aids to use, test and review with the review to be posted on Best Buy's website.

As I am very hard of hearing and also have tinnitus, I was very interested in Go Hearing's latest product as, to date, I have not found the perfect pair of hearing aids for my hearing condition and have not been fully satisfied with any of them I've tried before. 

The grey-colored Go Hearing Ultra OTC Hearing Aids arrived nicely boxed, with a rechargeable case for the hearing aids to nest in. The case acts as a charging station so no batteries are needed. These hearing aids are designed for use not, only to hear better, but also allow Buetooth connecction with smarphones allowing listening to digital music, podcasts and acceptance of phones calls while wearing. The Go Hearing Ultra are considerably less expensive than most prescription hearing aids with more features than many.

The Go Hearing Ultra Hearing Aids are grey in color and sit behind each ear making them somewhat inconspicuous. The fit via clear plastic tubing into your ear canal and come packaged with a number of different size in-ear buds to allow the user to find the perfect fit for their ears. Volume controls and a button to accept phone calls is positioned on the behind-ear hearing aid units making it easy and convenient to control the use of the hearing aids.

I only have one issue with the Go Hearing Ultra hearing aids - the inability to adjust the sound quality - treble, medium and bass. Other than that these are very good hearing aid units for the price!"
88,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Work Well and Easy to Use,"Reading through the included manual it does not tell me to install an app.  WooHoo!  A product that doesn’t need an app to work.  I plugged them in to charge.  Turns out they are shipped with a bit of paper covering the contacts!  So be sure to remove the paper from the contacts on each earpiece before charging!  Being used to an earbud style for any type of device in my ear, I was a bit nervous about putting the earpiece into my ear.  The directions said to hold your ear and pull it straight with your other hand to help insert the earpiece.  That technique worked great.  Once they are in your ears you don’t realize they are there.  I know they work because I only have to turn the television to one third the volume I do when I’m not wearing them.  Connecting to my phone was easy.  In the Bluetooth area the “Go Ultra” device simply showed up.  (The hearing aids were on and in my ears when I did this).  When making a phone call the Go Ultra device shows up on the phone just like “Speaker” so you can choose to use them for the phone call or not.  All in all, they work well and are easy to use.  The charging case charges even when it’s not plugged in (if the case has been charged) which is great for travel.  One item that takes a bit of getting used to is the retention wire that is used to help remove the dome from the ear.  If it sticks out too far, like it did when I first tried the hearing aids, then you need to insert the dome  into the ear.  Remember they are not earbuds!  I called customer service to inquire about the retention wire because it was sticking out past my ear.  I didn’t believe the recording when it said the wait time was 9 seconds.  The call was answered by a real person in about 3 seconds.  (Yes, I timed them).   Amazing in this day and age!"
88,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Nice to hear again!!,"I like my Go Ultra OTC hearing aids! I can hear better. Still adjusting to all the different things I can hear that I couldn't before. They have blutooth! That's nice! I can watch videos or listen to music without bothering anyone with loud volume. The only thing I don't like is while blutooth is active I can still hear everything else. It's not what I thought. It's not really a bad thing. Just threw me off at first. If you know you don't hear well, I recommend them!!"

88,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Bid Improvement,Took a little bit to tune in but that’s due to me. Very pleased to be able to hear again. My hearing is terrible and these hearing aids have made a big difference. Only problem I have is having to buy batteries since I didn’t purchase 250.00 charging unit
88,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Go Ultra OTC Hearing Aids,"I received the Go Hearing, Go Ultra OTC Hearing Aids in Gray. They seem to be well made and durable. They are comfortable to wear, don't fall out easily. I don't think they are right for my situation though, as I had a lot of whistling noises and my own voice was very amplified. I only have hearing loss in one ear.

Now I let my mother try them as she has more hearing loss than I do in both ears, and she said they were very clear, no noises or voice amplified and worked just as good as the ones she uses regularly.

Go Ultra hearing aids come in a nicely designed box with a compact recharge case that could easily fit in a bag or purse, it includes your hearing aids, an instruction manual, and several different tube lengths and dome tips.

Go Ultra comes with rechargeable batteries and allows 20 hours of battery life per charge.
allows Bluetooth streaming to iPhone and Android devices, does not allow customization to your specific hearing loss. Instead, the device has four pre-set programs, does not have a smartphone app. All adjustments are made through buttons on the back of the device.

Go Ultra has two buttons on each device. Here is a quick rundown of what each button does. 
Top Button - a 3-second press turns the hearing aids on and off a quick press and release increases the volume 
Bottom button - a 3-second press changes programs, a quick press and release decrease the volume, a quick press and release accepts or ends phone calls.

Go Ultra is worth a look if you are on a tight budget, have mild-moderate hearing loss, and need a device for simple listening situations like TV-watching."
88,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Very comfortable and work well,"These hearing aids work well and are very comfortable.  Setup is straightforward.  Out of the box, the first thing to do is charge them, which takes about three hours in the included charging case.  When I charged mine, they were ready to go in less than an hour.

The charging case holds the two aids only one way, so inserting them is no problem, and the case itself is charged along with the aids when plugged into the wall.  The case itself can then be used to charge the aids up to three time (according to the manual) if you’re away from a wall outlet.

To set up the aids for your ears, you begin by using the included “ear measuring tool,” which is a piece of L-shaped cardboard that hangs over your ear and measures the distance from the top of the location where your ear attaches to your head to the top of your ear canal.  The range of measurements is “1,” “2,” or “3,” and I am a 3.  The result of this measurement determines which of the three “ear tubes” you attach to the aids.

You then select the desired “ear dome” that attaches to the side of the aid that is inserted in your ear.  There are two types of domes, “open” and “closed,” where the choice depends on the type of results you want to experience.  The open dome is for more “natural” sound, while the closed dome emphasizes the bass registers, according to the manual.  Each dome type comes in three sizes. I use the open domes.

Inserting the aids in your ears is simple as they can go in only one way. Slide the top part of the aid (with the two control buttons) over your ear, insert the other end into your ear, and hook the little plastic wire attached to the aid around inside your outer ear to brace the aid in place.  I have found these aids, after three day of use, to be so comfortable that I forget that they’re there.  Wearing a pair of glasses over them is no issue at all.

The aids are turned on by a three-second press of one of the two buttons on each one.  The devices will say “power on,” and you’re off and running.  There are ten volume settings that you select by pressing the volume-up or volume-down buttons one step at a time.  After each press, the aids beep once to indicate that a new volume level has been selected.  When you reach the maximum or minimum, they beep three times.  I find that setting the volume levels at about the half-way point is best for me.  At the higher volume levels, the sound can be quite loud and shrill.

My hearing loss is considered mild and is concentrated at the higher frequencies. I also have been finding it more difficult to hear conversations in a noisy room.  So far, after three days of use, I’m finding it much easier to hear what’s going on around me.

In addition to acting as hearing aids, these units also feature Bluetooth capability, and they can be paired with your smartphone or any Bluetooth device.  Pairing them with my phone was a snap, and I can now both listen to music or whatever over my hearing aids as well as hearing the person I’m speaking with on a phone call.  

People with hearing aids are precluded from using earbuds because both need to be inserted into the ear to use, and there is room, obviously, for only one.  The combined capability of these aids neatly solves this problem. The one drawback to using the Bluetooth feature is that it greatly shortens the battery life.  I’ve not had a chance to test this, but the manual says that, without using Bluetooth, the batteries should last about 20 hours between charges.  When using Bluetooth, that drops to eight hours.

The box includes thin cleaning wires which are used to clean the ear tubes should the become clogged with wax.  I recommend keeping these handy as I have already needed them once.

Overall, I strongly recommend that anyone with mild hearing loss give these a try."

88,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Very happy,"So after getting about a week of use to give a fair and balanced review and opinion of these hearing aids there are some goods and only one real bad that i can find. Now i have a second set of hearing aids and i will not go into those but i'm kind of using those as a reference for these new ones i got. So first these come with a built in charger and when you put them in there case for the night you have a fully charged set,so you save some money because you do not need to buy hearing aid batteries and that's a big plus with these. My other ones you need to replace the batteries and they only last about two days of constant use. The sound quality is outstanding and also you do not need to have them set up with bluetooth with your phone unless you are going to stream music with them also then you need to set them up via bluetooth but not a big deal but it's nice if your picking them up only as hearing aids. I'll be honest with you the big appeal of these was the fact i can use them to stream music at work vs having my hearing aid and a set of earbuds also on me. I can use them as my go to hearing aids and earbuds for music and that is a very nice plus. But and you know there is always a but and that is if you use them only as hearing aids the battery life is great like 20 hours plus but if you stream with them it knocks the battery life down to about 4 hours. Bluetooth is very demanding for power and i know there is another way you can stream with earbuds a setting that they have to come with and it hooks up but not bluetooth and unfortunately these don't have them. It's not a big deal for me because i only listen to music for about 2 hours so by the time i am able to listen to them there is still a lot of battery power left. So al in all im am super happy with them. The streaming volume is not as loud as earbuds are but it's loud enough to stream your music."
88,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Comfortable and discreet,"I have been using the go hearing go uktra for a few weeks now and have loved the comfort of them. They are lightweight and fit really well in my ear and around it. Unlike others these dont irritate or bother me when wearing them for long periods of time. These come as a set, they come with a charging case with cable and adapter, open and closed domes as well as slim tubes. I love that the tubes are very discreet and are barely noticeable when wearing. As someone whose self consious of having to wear a hearing aid, this was my favorite feature. I love that it comes with a charging case because every night i can put them in the case to charge and not risk losing them or misplacing them. I can use them all day on one charge which is very convenient for me as im constantly on the go! I also love that i am able to stream calls, music, and even my social medias while wearing them! I have been able to hear great with these and they have helped tremendously with my hearing when i need it. Overall i highly reccomend the gonhearing go ultra hearing aids because they are comfortable and discreet and provide you the hearing that you deserve to have!"
88,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Improved hearing at a reasonable price point,"Go Hearing - Go Ultra OTC Hearing Aids – Gray

It’s certainly reassuring when the first thing you see when you open the box on these over-the-counter hearing aids is a blue card stating “Need Assistance? We’re here to help.” Included on that card is a phone number and web site URL where you can go for expert assistance. That’s a nice and welcome touch, since you usually need to go digging around for that information on many other products when you need help.

At first glance, the 48-page Go Ultra OTC hearing aid user manual seemed like a lot to digest. However, once I started reading through it, I realized that it was taking me, step-by-step, though the setup and use of these hearing aids. When I finished reading it, I felt that I had a very good understanding of the product, so I didn’t have to wonder how things worked. Very impressive and comforting! 

The unit comes with a portable charging/carrying/storage case which was already partially charged upon arrival. In less than an hour, I had three green lights, indicating that the charging unit itself and the two hearing aids inside were fully charged. It takes about three hours to get a full charge and under normal use, that full charge is supposed to last about 20 hours, depending on how you’ve set things up and how much you’ve used them. I prefer rechargeable hearing aids like these over the type that require installing special batteries, but that’s a personal preference. I find that it’s much easier to locate an outlet to plug the charging case into than it is to find a store that sells the special batteries that some hearing aids operate on.

These hearing aids come with multiple size ear domes (four each of small, medium, and large sizes) and six slim tubes (two each of sizes 1, 2 and 3) to help make sure you get the best fit. 

While you may have to try on the different ear domes to decide which one gives you the best fit, there’s a measuring guide for both the right and left ear that lets you know which of the three slim tubes is the appropriate size without you having to try each of them on. However, you may find that the ones pre-installed on the hearing aids work just fine for you. That’s what happened in our case.

While some similar devices use a phone app to control and adjust the various settings, these hearing aids don’t require any outside devices to control things. Instead, it has four built-in preset programs that you can choose from by simply toggling between them, using the built-in buttons located on the rear of the hearing aids. And then, the next time you use the hearing aids, it remembers and uses the last program and settings you used.

Once setup is complete and you’ve got your settings where you want them, the real test comes when you’re ready to try out these hearing aids under multiple conditions. My wife, who suffers from moderate hearing loss, used these under different conditions and found that they work well at improving her everyday listening. Her only initial problem was trying to remember what all the different presses of the control buttons on the rear of the hearing aids do. To help her with that, I made her a “cheat sheet” copy from the user’s manual. And I can also confirm that these hearing aids seem to be working well, since I no longer hear “What did you say?” whenever I speak to her.

And finally, it’s good to know that they come with a one-year warranty on both parts and labor.

Over-the-counter hearing aids are here to stay, and these Go Ultra OTC hearing aids could certainly be a good choice for those who prefer the behind-the-ear style."
88,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,"Go Ultra, Go Comfort!","These Go Ultra OTC Hearing Aids from Go Hearing have actually surprised me in a good way.  I initially thought because I wear glasses, I needed hearing aids that weren’t over-the-ear.  I was wrong.  If I simply put in the new Go Ultras first and then my glasses, I may get an initial clanking noise (not if I’m careful) when the temple bars of my glasses makes contact with the body of the aids, but that’s it for the rest of the day.  Cool.  And since we’re on the topic of comfort, these are SO much more comfortable than an all-in-the-ear-canal micro-aid I’ve also given a try…and much less, if any, feedback.  Wearing them all day doesn’t seem to cause any irritation/discomfort that I’ve experienced in the past. 

Let’s talk about being inconspicuous.  My silvery white hair flows ever-so-gracefully down to the top and around the back of my ears.  (I paid a lot for these highlights!)  I wore the new set of Go Ultra aids all day and no one in my family noticed them.  I had to point them out.

Charging case — These aids are so much more flexible to live with on a daily basis because they are rechargeable.  I hate having to change out hearing aid batteries, and their cost, and their disposal, etc., etc.  With the Go Ultras, you don’t have to worry about that.

These aids come with a plethora of different sized ear plugs, tubes, and cleaning tools.  All good.  I’ll advise you now to be patient when going through the setup and sizing.  It takes time and some experimentation.  You may become frustrated at first, but once you find the magic fit, you’re set.  It’s worth the little bit of hassle at the outset.

There are a couple things I wish were different —

First, when going through the setup, if you find that you need a different sized tube, you may find it difficult to turn and separate the tube from the main body of the hearing aid.  I finally got it, but it wasn’t easy.  Do NOT pull on the tube itself.  Follow the instructions (which I thought were pretty well written by someone who seemed to have a decent grasp of the English language.  That’s rare these days).  The silicone buds were much easier to deal with — and they give you two styles, open and closed.  Since I have one ear much worse than the other, I’ve actually gone with the closed style on my bad side, and open on the other.  Nice to have the option.

That last thing that bothers me a bit is the battery life when using a bluetooth connection.  It’s awesome that you can connect with your phone to make or answer calls, or stream music.  But doing so quickly uses battery power.  You can go from lasting all day (10-12 hrs just as a hearing aid), to lasting 3-4 hours if you’re constantly streaming or talking on the phone.  I’ve found it easier for me to simply pull the Go Ultra bud out of my ear and talk on the phone as I normally would.  Using the speakerphone works, as well (as is the hands-free phone in the car.)

If you're considering trying some OTC before spending thousands, Go Ultra is worth the try.  If they work for you, like they do for me, it can be life-changing."
88,BestBuy,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,Comfortable,"This pair of hearing aids are comfortable for me to wear and the style I prefer.  Personally I prefer those around to know that I do have hearing loss.  Using ones that go in the ear (like earbuds) I get questioned at work with them and have to explain they are hearing aids.  I also have a lump in my left ear wear those sit and so they are always coming out.  With this style, they are behind my ear and then they have the part that goes directly into the ear canal.  They don’t come out as easy and if they do, they are still held in place and don’t fall to the ground.  I also like that they were easy to connect to phone and you can use these as hearing aides but also to listen to apps like YouTube and to take calls.  However, that is it for me as far as positive things. 

Sound quality was super quiet for me.  And even worse if they did come out even a little. I felt I could hear more without these.  All of the other hearing aids I have get much louder.  These do not have an app to adjust settings as well.  I was hoping that because they are made by Lexie that the Lexie app would work but it did not.  An app would have been nice to do a simple test for each ear and then adjust them from that.  As well as just to adjust in general.  This is a bigger deal for me as what good are hearing aids is you can’t hear with them.

The case is a bit bulky as well, but I like that they are rechargeable and the case acts like a battery back up to charge them.  The cord though could be a little longer as it’s short.  

These I give a 2 star just for the comfort and because they were easy to connect and when connected they allow you to use with apps."
88,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Improved my hearing and it streams !,"I have used other OTC hearing aids and I find these to be far superior. 

Out of the box the hearing aids performed perfectly. You must read he included user manual to check for proper fitting and the purpose of the two push buttons. The only thing I changed was the dome and I changed it to small. I did not have to change the slim tubes but two others of different lengths are included in the box. Medium and large domes are included in the package along with a cleaning tool. 

The is no APP. The units have 4 preset settings, Normal to boost all sounds, high-frequency boost, low frequency boost and General which the manual said is for steaming music. My particular hearing loss requires a high-frequency boost and this setting works just fine for me. I vary the volume as necessary depending on my environment.

 When paired with my Android phone I am able to answer calls and actually hear the person and the callers hear me just fine. I can also stream music and it sounds great. My other OTC hearing aids ( which cost more )  do not have any streaming either for music or phone calls. It has been my experience that constant streaming music and talking on phone will reduce battery life to around 3-4 hours. Normal use will last all day. I charge them at night. 

Left and right hearing aids can be adjusted separately for volume and the 4 sound presets directly from the device. Again, no APP is provided or needed. That is not possible with my current OTC hearing aids that require an internet connection to make significant parameter changes. Again, a big plus for this product.

The units were charged upon arrival. The very odd thing is the charging case. The case has a battery that allows me to charge the hearing aids  around 3 times without having it plugged in. That is very convenient  In order to recharge the case battery you must connect the charging cable to the bottom of the case so you have to lay it on its side. How can such a well thought out product have this, in my opinion, design flaw. There are LED’s on the case that provide status of the hearing aid battery and the charging case battery. 

The streaming is a game changer. I no longer have to put up with feedback when holding my phone up to my ear with my other OTC hearing aids. I can not go back to my other OTC hearing aids. I have been spoiled with this great product, it has far exceeded my expectations for an OTC hearing aid."

The hearing aids have 4 preprogrammed settings. These are utilized by selecting the multi-function button B. 
The charging case has 3 led lights; the center is for the case and the others for each hearing aid. Blue for charging and green for charged. I found that if the light does not illuminate the earpiece is not correctly mounted. 
After initial charging set-up one took a few minutes. The hearing aids are light weight and did not cause any discomfort during prolonged use. After adjusting the sound level to my liking, I was done with the set-up. I wore the hearing aids for 10 hours doing normal everyday things. The next day I put them back in and forgot they were there. 
The Go Ultra Hearing Aids are Bluetooth enabled. You can pair them to your phone or device. It was a strange feeling pairing to the phone, as I could hear the phone in both ears. This made the conversation easier to follow as I have better hearing in one ear than the other.
The Go Ultra Hearing Aids also have built in noise reduction. Battery life is expected to be 20 hours without Bluetooth. With Bluetooth enabled by not in use you can get about 8 hours. Streaming cuts it down to 2.5 to 3 hours. To fully charge the batteries place them back in the case and it takes up to 3 hours to recharge.
The Go Ultra Hearing Aids comes with a 45-day return policy. Try them and you will love them."
88,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Go Hearing - Go Ultra OTC Hearing Aids,"So I received my Go Hearing - Go Ultra OTC Hearing Aids about a week ago and have been putting them through their paces. Now I have not been properly diagnosed with any type of hearing loss, though, I have known myself for awhile that my dominant ear is my right ear, which means there has to be some hearing loss in my left ear.

Upon opening the box, you will find:

* Go Hearing Go Ultra OTC Hearing Aids (1 pair: Left & Right)
* Charging Case with Charging Cable & Adaptor
* Open Domes (2 Small, 2 Medium, and 2 Large)
* Closed Domes (2 Small, 2 Medium, and 2 Large)
* Slim Tube (2 Small, 2 Medium, and 2 Large)
* Cleaning Wire
* Cleaning Brush
* Ear Measurement Tool
* User Manual

To get  started, simply follow along with the User Manual. It's best to ensure the hearing aids are fully charged before using them. Once fully charged, these hearing aids are really to pair and connect with your smartphone. Something I noticed right off the bat is that there was no app to download, install, and create a user profile. I like that. It's simply hold to power them on and pair them through your bluetooth settings in your phone or other mobile device as you would any other bluetooth device. Using the included ear measurement tool will help with ensure you have the right sized slim tube. The tubes are a little hard to remove and replace, though with a little patience you should be able to remove the old slim tube and connect the right tube for proper fitting. After installing the correct slim tube, now you can replace the ear domes and choose from whether you prefer open domes or the closed domes. The closed domes seemed to work better for me. Your mileage may vary.

After proper fit and installation of the proper slim tubes and domes, you're ready to go. Initially i found the sound to be very teeny until I got the correct tubes and domes installed and was able to hear much better and clearer. And they feel wonderful in my ears. Each hearing aid works independent of one another, which is something that I absolutely love. I can wear the right one and keep the left one charged or vice versa. Or wear both of them at the same time. 

A couple of great features that I love about the Go Ultra OTC hearing aids aside from them working independent of one another, is the fact that they stream music flawlessly without any issue. Calls were clear and not muffled like I've had on other more expensive hearing aid sets. One thing I would like to see, is an easier way to remove the slim wires, it took me a few minutes to remove these, but I managed. Other than that they are a decent budget pair of hearing aids that I will use."
88,BestBuy,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,You get what you pay for,"Made by Lexie, the Go Ultra is a pair of simple to use, relatively inexpensive, over-the-counter (OTC) hearing aids, but they are hearing aids with some major drawbacks.

The units are reasonably sized for OTC rechargeables, and are very lightweight. Much like earbuds, they have a charging case that serves as a battery pack for charging the hearing aids. The case itself is charged using a standard USB-C cable. A single charge to the Go Ultra will last about 22 hours, according to the company.

Setup is relatively simple, following the pattern of most over-the-ear, OTC hearing aids. For physical fit, you use a sizer to determine the proper length of wire and select the appropriate dome. Each hearing aid has a power button that doubles as volume up and a program select button that doubles as a sound profile selector. And those rudimentary settings are part of the problem with the Go Ultra. Each hearing aid is adjusted individually, and they remember your previous settings between charges.

Everyone has a hearing profile, where certain frequencies are diminished and others are clear. A hearing test, either on your phone, on-line, or through an audiologist, will help you determine your profile. But the Go Ultra doesn't have any of these tests, but instead uses a rather crude series of sound profiles; normal, high frequency, low frequency, and high gain (like normal, but with additional volume boosting). If, like me, you have low and high frequency loss, there is no setting that works properly. In fact, it’s hard to imagine who has hearing loss that matches these broad settings. It’s like trying to paint trim with a roller.

The Go Ultra will connect via Bluetooth, and connection is simple. You can then stream music and take calls, although no one is going to confuse these with quality earbuds. It also appears that the streaming sound is not impacted by the selected sound profile. If you have trouble hearing high frequencies in your music, you will still have issues hearing high frequencies in your music.

But, the main purpose of any hearing aid is to help your hearing, and this is where I had real issues with the Go Ultra. Voices, rustling paper, and other common sounds were harsh and artificial sounding. In fact, so long as the volume of the person speaking was not too soft I could hear conversations better unaided than with these. My own voice was abnormally amplified. I have worn a single hearing aid for about a decade, and this is the first time I’ve experienced this. Sounds were also slightly delayed. With two hearing aids in things weren’t overly bad, but with one in there was a ricochet effect, where the unassisted ear heard things a fraction of a second earlier than the aided ear. Most likely the effect of a slow processor in the hearing aids, t was, at best, distracting.

Most people are probably going to be a lot better off with something else. Yes, a better set will undoubtably cost quite a bit more, but sometimes you really do get exactly what you pay for."
88,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Go Hearing's Ultra OTC Hearing Aids Are Quite Good,"I received a pair of Go Hearing - Go Ultra OTC Hearing Aids to use, test and review with the review to be posted on Best Buy's website.

As I am very hard of hearing and also have tinnitus, I was very interested in Go Hearing's latest product as, to date, I have not found the perfect pair of hearing aids for my hearing condition and have not been fully satisfied with any of them I've tried before. 

The grey-colored Go Hearing Ultra OTC Hearing Aids arrived nicely boxed, with a rechargeable case for the hearing aids to nest in. The case acts as a charging station so no batteries are needed. These hearing aids are designed for use not, only to hear better, but also allow Buetooth connecction with smarphones allowing listening to digital music, podcasts and acceptance of phones calls while wearing. The Go Hearing Ultra are considerably less expensive than most prescription hearing aids with more features than many.

The Go Hearing Ultra Hearing Aids are grey in color and sit behind each ear making them somewhat inconspicuous. The fit via clear plastic tubing into your ear canal and come packaged with a number of different size in-ear buds to allow the user to find the perfect fit for their ears. Volume controls and a button to accept phone calls is positioned on the behind-ear hearing aid units making it easy and convenient to control the use of the hearing aids.

I only have one issue with the Go Hearing Ultra hearing aids - the inability to adjust the sound quality - treble, medium and bass. Other than that these are very good hearing aid units for the price!"
88,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Work Well and Easy to Use,"Reading through the included manual it does not tell me to install an app.  WooHoo!  A product that doesn’t need an app to work.  I plugged them in to charge.  Turns out they are shipped with a bit of paper covering the contacts!  So be sure to remove the paper from the contacts on each earpiece before charging!  Being used to an earbud style for any type of device in my ear, I was a bit nervous about putting the earpiece into my ear.  The directions said to hold your ear and pull it straight with your other hand to help insert the earpiece.  That technique worked great.  Once they are in your ears you don’t realize they are there.  I know they work because I only have to turn the television to one third the volume I do when I’m not wearing them.  Connecting to my phone was easy.  In the Bluetooth area the “Go Ultra” device simply showed up.  (The hearing aids were on and in my ears when I did this).  When making a phone call the Go Ultra device shows up on the phone just like “Speaker” so you can choose to use them for the phone call or not.  All in all, they work well and are easy to use.  The charging case charges even when it’s not plugged in (if the case has been charged) which is great for travel.  One item that takes a bit of getting used to is the retention wire that is used to help remove the dome from the ear.  If it sticks out too far, like it did when I first tried the hearing aids, then you need to insert the dome  into the ear.  Remember they are not earbuds!  I called customer service to inquire about the retention wire because it was sticking out past my ear.  I didn’t believe the recording when it said the wait time was 9 seconds.  The call was answered by a real person in about 3 seconds.  (Yes, I timed them).   Amazing in this day and age!"
88,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Nice to hear again!!,"I like my Go Ultra OTC hearing aids! I can hear better. Still adjusting to all the different things I can hear that I couldn't before. They have blutooth! That's nice! I can watch videos or listen to music without bothering anyone with loud volume. The only thing I don't like is while blutooth is active I can still hear everything else. It's not what I thought. It's not really a bad thing. Just threw me off at first. If you know you don't hear well, I recommend them!!"

88,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Bid Improvement,Took a little bit to tune in but that’s due to me. Very pleased to be able to hear again. My hearing is terrible and these hearing aids have made a big difference. Only problem I have is having to buy batteries since I didn’t purchase 250.00 charging unit
88,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Go Ultra OTC Hearing Aids,"I received the Go Hearing, Go Ultra OTC Hearing Aids in Gray. They seem to be well made and durable. They are comfortable to wear, don't fall out easily. I don't think they are right for my situation though, as I had a lot of whistling noises and my own voice was very amplified. I only have hearing loss in one ear.

Now I let my mother try them as she has more hearing loss than I do in both ears, and she said they were very clear, no noises or voice amplified and worked just as good as the ones she uses regularly.

Go Ultra hearing aids come in a nicely designed box with a compact recharge case that could easily fit in a bag or purse, it includes your hearing aids, an instruction manual, and several different tube lengths and dome tips.

Go Ultra comes with rechargeable batteries and allows 20 hours of battery life per charge.
allows Bluetooth streaming to iPhone and Android devices, does not allow customization to your specific hearing loss. Instead, the device has four pre-set programs, does not have a smartphone app. All adjustments are made through buttons on the back of the device.

Go Ultra has two buttons on each device. Here is a quick rundown of what each button does. 
Top Button - a 3-second press turns the hearing aids on and off a quick press and release increases the volume 
Bottom button - a 3-second press changes programs, a quick press and release decrease the volume, a quick press and release accepts or ends phone calls.

Go Ultra is worth a look if you are on a tight budget, have mild-moderate hearing loss, and need a device for simple listening situations like TV-watching."
88,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Very comfortable and work well,"These hearing aids work well and are very comfortable.  Setup is straightforward.  Out of the box, the first thing to do is charge them, which takes about three hours in the included charging case.  When I charged mine, they were ready to go in less than an hour.

The charging case holds the two aids only one way, so inserting them is no problem, and the case itself is charged along with the aids when plugged into the wall.  The case itself can then be used to charge the aids up to three time (according to the manual) if you’re away from a wall outlet.

To set up the aids for your ears, you begin by using the included “ear measuring tool,” which is a piece of L-shaped cardboard that hangs over your ear and measures the distance from the top of the location where your ear attaches to your head to the top of your ear canal.  The range of measurements is “1,” “2,” or “3,” and I am a 3.  The result of this measurement determines which of the three “ear tubes” you attach to the aids.

You then select the desired “ear dome” that attaches to the side of the aid that is inserted in your ear.  There are two types of domes, “open” and “closed,” where the choice depends on the type of results you want to experience.  The open dome is for more “natural” sound, while the closed dome emphasizes the bass registers, according to the manual.  Each dome type comes in three sizes. I use the open domes.

Inserting the aids in your ears is simple as they can go in only one way. Slide the top part of the aid (with the two control buttons) over your ear, insert the other end into your ear, and hook the little plastic wire attached to the aid around inside your outer ear to brace the aid in place.  I have found these aids, after three day of use, to be so comfortable that I forget that they’re there.  Wearing a pair of glasses over them is no issue at all.

The aids are turned on by a three-second press of one of the two buttons on each one.  The devices will say “power on,” and you’re off and running.  There are ten volume settings that you select by pressing the volume-up or volume-down buttons one step at a time.  After each press, the aids beep once to indicate that a new volume level has been selected.  When you reach the maximum or minimum, they beep three times.  I find that setting the volume levels at about the half-way point is best for me.  At the higher volume levels, the sound can be quite loud and shrill.

My hearing loss is considered mild and is concentrated at the higher frequencies. I also have been finding it more difficult to hear conversations in a noisy room.  So far, after three days of use, I’m finding it much easier to hear what’s going on around me.

In addition to acting as hearing aids, these units also feature Bluetooth capability, and they can be paired with your smartphone or any Bluetooth device.  Pairing them with my phone was a snap, and I can now both listen to music or whatever over my hearing aids as well as hearing the person I’m speaking with on a phone call.  

People with hearing aids are precluded from using earbuds because both need to be inserted into the ear to use, and there is room, obviously, for only one.  The combined capability of these aids neatly solves this problem. The one drawback to using the Bluetooth feature is that it greatly shortens the battery life.  I’ve not had a chance to test this, but the manual says that, without using Bluetooth, the batteries should last about 20 hours between charges.  When using Bluetooth, that drops to eight hours.

The box includes thin cleaning wires which are used to clean the ear tubes should the become clogged with wax.  I recommend keeping these handy as I have already needed them once.

Overall, I strongly recommend that anyone with mild hearing loss give these a try."

88,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Very happy,"So after getting about a week of use to give a fair and balanced review and opinion of these hearing aids there are some goods and only one real bad that i can find. Now i have a second set of hearing aids and i will not go into those but i'm kind of using those as a reference for these new ones i got. So first these come with a built in charger and when you put them in there case for the night you have a fully charged set,so you save some money because you do not need to buy hearing aid batteries and that's a big plus with these. My other ones you need to replace the batteries and they only last about two days of constant use. The sound quality is outstanding and also you do not need to have them set up with bluetooth with your phone unless you are going to stream music with them also then you need to set them up via bluetooth but not a big deal but it's nice if your picking them up only as hearing aids. I'll be honest with you the big appeal of these was the fact i can use them to stream music at work vs having my hearing aid and a set of earbuds also on me. I can use them as my go to hearing aids and earbuds for music and that is a very nice plus. But and you know there is always a but and that is if you use them only as hearing aids the battery life is great like 20 hours plus but if you stream with them it knocks the battery life down to about 4 hours. Bluetooth is very demanding for power and i know there is another way you can stream with earbuds a setting that they have to come with and it hooks up but not bluetooth and unfortunately these don't have them. It's not a big deal for me because i only listen to music for about 2 hours so by the time i am able to listen to them there is still a lot of battery power left. So al in all im am super happy with them. The streaming volume is not as loud as earbuds are but it's loud enough to stream your music."
88,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Comfortable and discreet,"I have been using the go hearing go uktra for a few weeks now and have loved the comfort of them. They are lightweight and fit really well in my ear and around it. Unlike others these dont irritate or bother me when wearing them for long periods of time. These come as a set, they come with a charging case with cable and adapter, open and closed domes as well as slim tubes. I love that the tubes are very discreet and are barely noticeable when wearing. As someone whose self consious of having to wear a hearing aid, this was my favorite feature. I love that it comes with a charging case because every night i can put them in the case to charge and not risk losing them or misplacing them. I can use them all day on one charge which is very convenient for me as im constantly on the go! I also love that i am able to stream calls, music, and even my social medias while wearing them! I have been able to hear great with these and they have helped tremendously with my hearing when i need it. Overall i highly reccomend the gonhearing go ultra hearing aids because they are comfortable and discreet and provide you the hearing that you deserve to have!"
88,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Improved hearing at a reasonable price point,"Go Hearing - Go Ultra OTC Hearing Aids – Gray

It’s certainly reassuring when the first thing you see when you open the box on these over-the-counter hearing aids is a blue card stating “Need Assistance? We’re here to help.” Included on that card is a phone number and web site URL where you can go for expert assistance. That’s a nice and welcome touch, since you usually need to go digging around for that information on many other products when you need help.

At first glance, the 48-page Go Ultra OTC hearing aid user manual seemed like a lot to digest. However, once I started reading through it, I realized that it was taking me, step-by-step, though the setup and use of these hearing aids. When I finished reading it, I felt that I had a very good understanding of the product, so I didn’t have to wonder how things worked. Very impressive and comforting! 

The unit comes with a portable charging/carrying/storage case which was already partially charged upon arrival. In less than an hour, I had three green lights, indicating that the charging unit itself and the two hearing aids inside were fully charged. It takes about three hours to get a full charge and under normal use, that full charge is supposed to last about 20 hours, depending on how you’ve set things up and how much you’ve used them. I prefer rechargeable hearing aids like these over the type that require installing special batteries, but that’s a personal preference. I find that it’s much easier to locate an outlet to plug the charging case into than it is to find a store that sells the special batteries that some hearing aids operate on.

These hearing aids come with multiple size ear domes (four each of small, medium, and large sizes) and six slim tubes (two each of sizes 1, 2 and 3) to help make sure you get the best fit. 

While you may have to try on the different ear domes to decide which one gives you the best fit, there’s a measuring guide for both the right and left ear that lets you know which of the three slim tubes is the appropriate size without you having to try each of them on. However, you may find that the ones pre-installed on the hearing aids work just fine for you. That’s what happened in our case.

While some similar devices use a phone app to control and adjust the various settings, these hearing aids don’t require any outside devices to control things. Instead, it has four built-in preset programs that you can choose from by simply toggling between them, using the built-in buttons located on the rear of the hearing aids. And then, the next time you use the hearing aids, it remembers and uses the last program and settings you used.

Once setup is complete and you’ve got your settings where you want them, the real test comes when you’re ready to try out these hearing aids under multiple conditions. My wife, who suffers from moderate hearing loss, used these under different conditions and found that they work well at improving her everyday listening. Her only initial problem was trying to remember what all the different presses of the control buttons on the rear of the hearing aids do. To help her with that, I made her a “cheat sheet” copy from the user’s manual. And I can also confirm that these hearing aids seem to be working well, since I no longer hear “What did you say?” whenever I speak to her.

And finally, it’s good to know that they come with a one-year warranty on both parts and labor.

Over-the-counter hearing aids are here to stay, and these Go Ultra OTC hearing aids could certainly be a good choice for those who prefer the behind-the-ear style."
88,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,"Go Ultra, Go Comfort!","These Go Ultra OTC Hearing Aids from Go Hearing have actually surprised me in a good way.  I initially thought because I wear glasses, I needed hearing aids that weren’t over-the-ear.  I was wrong.  If I simply put in the new Go Ultras first and then my glasses, I may get an initial clanking noise (not if I’m careful) when the temple bars of my glasses makes contact with the body of the aids, but that’s it for the rest of the day.  Cool.  And since we’re on the topic of comfort, these are SO much more comfortable than an all-in-the-ear-canal micro-aid I’ve also given a try…and much less, if any, feedback.  Wearing them all day doesn’t seem to cause any irritation/discomfort that I’ve experienced in the past. 

Let’s talk about being inconspicuous.  My silvery white hair flows ever-so-gracefully down to the top and around the back of my ears.  (I paid a lot for these highlights!)  I wore the new set of Go Ultra aids all day and no one in my family noticed them.  I had to point them out.

Charging case — These aids are so much more flexible to live with on a daily basis because they are rechargeable.  I hate having to change out hearing aid batteries, and their cost, and their disposal, etc., etc.  With the Go Ultras, you don’t have to worry about that.

These aids come with a plethora of different sized ear plugs, tubes, and cleaning tools.  All good.  I’ll advise you now to be patient when going through the setup and sizing.  It takes time and some experimentation.  You may become frustrated at first, but once you find the magic fit, you’re set.  It’s worth the little bit of hassle at the outset.

There are a couple things I wish were different —

First, when going through the setup, if you find that you need a different sized tube, you may find it difficult to turn and separate the tube from the main body of the hearing aid.  I finally got it, but it wasn’t easy.  Do NOT pull on the tube itself.  Follow the instructions (which I thought were pretty well written by someone who seemed to have a decent grasp of the English language.  That’s rare these days).  The silicone buds were much easier to deal with — and they give you two styles, open and closed.  Since I have one ear much worse than the other, I’ve actually gone with the closed style on my bad side, and open on the other.  Nice to have the option.

That last thing that bothers me a bit is the battery life when using a bluetooth connection.  It’s awesome that you can connect with your phone to make or answer calls, or stream music.  But doing so quickly uses battery power.  You can go from lasting all day (10-12 hrs just as a hearing aid), to lasting 3-4 hours if you’re constantly streaming or talking on the phone.  I’ve found it easier for me to simply pull the Go Ultra bud out of my ear and talk on the phone as I normally would.  Using the speakerphone works, as well (as is the hands-free phone in the car.)

If you're considering trying some OTC before spending thousands, Go Ultra is worth the try.  If they work for you, like they do for me, it can be life-changing."
88,BestBuy,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,Comfortable,"This pair of hearing aids are comfortable for me to wear and the style I prefer.  Personally I prefer those around to know that I do have hearing loss.  Using ones that go in the ear (like earbuds) I get questioned at work with them and have to explain they are hearing aids.  I also have a lump in my left ear wear those sit and so they are always coming out.  With this style, they are behind my ear and then they have the part that goes directly into the ear canal.  They don’t come out as easy and if they do, they are still held in place and don’t fall to the ground.  I also like that they were easy to connect to phone and you can use these as hearing aides but also to listen to apps like YouTube and to take calls.  However, that is it for me as far as positive things. 

Sound quality was super quiet for me.  And even worse if they did come out even a little. I felt I could hear more without these.  All of the other hearing aids I have get much louder.  These do not have an app to adjust settings as well.  I was hoping that because they are made by Lexie that the Lexie app would work but it did not.  An app would have been nice to do a simple test for each ear and then adjust them from that.  As well as just to adjust in general.  This is a bigger deal for me as what good are hearing aids is you can’t hear with them.

The case is a bit bulky as well, but I like that they are rechargeable and the case acts like a battery back up to charge them.  The cord though could be a little longer as it’s short.  

These I give a 2 star just for the comfort and because they were easy to connect and when connected they allow you to use with apps."
88,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Improved my hearing and it streams !,"I have used other OTC hearing aids and I find these to be far superior. 

Out of the box the hearing aids performed perfectly. You must read he included user manual to check for proper fitting and the purpose of the two push buttons. The only thing I changed was the dome and I changed it to small. I did not have to change the slim tubes but two others of different lengths are included in the box. Medium and large domes are included in the package along with a cleaning tool. 

The is no APP. The units have 4 preset settings, Normal to boost all sounds, high-frequency boost, low frequency boost and General which the manual said is for steaming music. My particular hearing loss requires a high-frequency boost and this setting works just fine for me. I vary the volume as necessary depending on my environment.

 When paired with my Android phone I am able to answer calls and actually hear the person and the callers hear me just fine. I can also stream music and it sounds great. My other OTC hearing aids ( which cost more )  do not have any streaming either for music or phone calls. It has been my experience that constant streaming music and talking on phone will reduce battery life to around 3-4 hours. Normal use will last all day. I charge them at night. 

Left and right hearing aids can be adjusted separately for volume and the 4 sound presets directly from the device. Again, no APP is provided or needed. That is not possible with my current OTC hearing aids that require an internet connection to make significant parameter changes. Again, a big plus for this product.

The units were charged upon arrival. The very odd thing is the charging case. The case has a battery that allows me to charge the hearing aids  around 3 times without having it plugged in. That is very convenient  In order to recharge the case battery you must connect the charging cable to the bottom of the case so you have to lay it on its side. How can such a well thought out product have this, in my opinion, design flaw. There are LED’s on the case that provide status of the hearing aid battery and the charging case battery. 

The streaming is a game changer. I no longer have to put up with feedback when holding my phone up to my ear with my other OTC hearing aids. I can not go back to my other OTC hearing aids. I have been spoiled with this great product, it has far exceeded my expectations for an OTC hearing aid."

After adjusting the sound level to my liking, I was done with the set-up. I wore the hearing aids for 10 hours doing normal everyday things. The next day I put them back in and forgot they were there. 
The Go Ultra Hearing Aids are Bluetooth enabled. You can pair them to your phone or device. It was a strange feeling pairing to the phone, as I could hear the phone in both ears. This made the conversation easier to follow as I have better hearing in one ear than the other.
The Go Ultra Hearing Aids also have built in noise reduction. Battery life is expected to be 20 hours without Bluetooth. With Bluetooth enabled by not in use you can get about 8 hours. Streaming cuts it down to 2.5 to 3 hours. To fully charge the batteries place them back in the case and it takes up to 3 hours to recharge.

To get  started, simply follow along with the User Manual. It's best to ensure the hearing aids are fully charged before using them. Once fully charged, these hearing aids are really to pair and connect with your smartphone. Something I noticed right off the bat is that there was no app to download, install, and create a user profile. I like that. It's simply hold to power them on and pair them through your bluetooth settings in your phone or other mobile device as you would any other bluetooth device. Using the included ear measurement tool will help with ensure you have the right sized slim tube. The tubes are a little hard to remove and replace, though with a little patience you should be able to remove the old slim tube and connect the right tube for proper fitting. After installing the correct slim tube, now you can replace the ear domes and choose from whether you prefer open domes or the closed domes. The closed domes seemed to work better for me. Your mileage may vary.

After proper fit and installation of the proper slim tubes and domes, you're ready to go. Initially i found the sound to be very teeny until I got the correct tubes and domes installed and was able to hear much better and clearer. And they feel wonderful in my ears. Each hearing aid works independent of one another, which is something that I absolutely love. I can wear the right one and keep the left one charged or vice versa. Or wear both of them at the same time. 

A couple of great features that I love about the Go Ultra OTC hearing aids aside from them working independent of one another, is the fact that they stream music flawlessly without any issue. Calls were clear and not muffled like I've had on other more expensive hearing aid sets. One thing I would like to see, is an easier way to remove the slim wires, it took me a few minutes to remove these, but I managed. Other than that they are a decent budget pair of hearing aids that I will use."
88,BestBuy,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,You get what you pay for,"Made by Lexie, the Go Ultra is a pair of simple to use, relatively inexpensive, over-the-counter (OTC) hearing aids, but they are hearing aids with some major drawbacks.

The units are reasonably sized for OTC rechargeables, and are very lightweight. Much like earbuds, they have a charging case that serves as a battery pack for charging the hearing aids. The case itself is charged using a standard USB-C cable. A single charge to the Go Ultra will last about 22 hours, according to the company.

Setup is relatively simple, following the pattern of most over-the-ear, OTC hearing aids. For physical fit, you use a sizer to determine the proper length of wire and select the appropriate dome. Each hearing aid has a power button that doubles as volume up and a program select button that doubles as a sound profile selector. And those rudimentary settings are part of the problem with the Go Ultra. Each hearing aid is adjusted individually, and they remember your previous settings between charges.

Everyone has a hearing profile, where certain frequencies are diminished and others are clear. A hearing test, either on your phone, on-line, or through an audiologist, will help you determine your profile. But the Go Ultra doesn't have any of these tests, but instead uses a rather crude series of sound profiles; normal, high frequency, low frequency, and high gain (like normal, but with additional volume boosting). If, like me, you have low and high frequency loss, there is no setting that works properly. In fact, it’s hard to imagine who has hearing loss that matches these broad settings. It’s like trying to paint trim with a roller.

The Go Ultra will connect via Bluetooth, and connection is simple. You can then stream music and take calls, although no one is going to confuse these with quality earbuds. It also appears that the streaming sound is not impacted by the selected sound profile. If you have trouble hearing high frequencies in your music, you will still have issues hearing high frequencies in your music.

But, the main purpose of any hearing aid is to help your hearing, and this is where I had real issues with the Go Ultra. Voices, rustling paper, and other common sounds were harsh and artificial sounding. In fact, so long as the volume of the person speaking was not too soft I could hear conversations better unaided than with these. My own voice was abnormally amplified. I have worn a single hearing aid for about a decade, and this is the first time I’ve experienced this. Sounds were also slightly delayed. With two hearing aids in things weren’t overly bad, but with one in there was a ricochet effect, where the unassisted ear heard things a fraction of a second earlier than the aided ear. Most likely the effect of a slow processor in the hearing aids, t was, at best, distracting.

Most people are probably going to be a lot better off with something else. Yes, a better set will undoubtably cost quite a bit more, but sometimes you really do get exactly what you pay for."
88,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Go Hearing's Ultra OTC Hearing Aids Are Quite Good,"I received a pair of Go Hearing - Go Ultra OTC Hearing Aids to use, test and review with the review to be posted on Best Buy's website.

As I am very hard of hearing and also have tinnitus, I was very interested in Go Hearing's latest product as, to date, I have not found the perfect pair of hearing aids for my hearing condition and have not been fully satisfied with any of them I've tried before. 

The grey-colored Go Hearing Ultra OTC Hearing Aids arrived nicely boxed, with a rechargeable case for the hearing aids to nest in. The case acts as a charging station so no batteries are needed. These hearing aids are designed for use not, only to hear better, but also allow Buetooth connecction with smarphones allowing listening to digital music, podcasts and acceptance of phones calls while wearing. The Go Hearing Ultra are considerably less expensive than most prescription hearing aids with more features than many.

The Go Hearing Ultra Hearing Aids are grey in color and sit behind each ear making them somewhat inconspicuous. The fit via clear plastic tubing into your ear canal and come packaged with a number of different size in-ear buds to allow the user to find the perfect fit for their ears. Volume controls and a button to accept phone calls is positioned on the behind-ear hearing aid units making it easy and convenient to control the use of the hearing aids.

I only have one issue with the Go Hearing Ultra hearing aids - the inability to adjust the sound quality - treble, medium and bass. Other than that these are very good hearing aid units for the price!"
88,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Work Well and Easy to Use,"Reading through the included manual it does not tell me to install an app.  WooHoo!  A product that doesn’t need an app to work.  I plugged them in to charge.  Turns out they are shipped with a bit of paper covering the contacts!  So be sure to remove the paper from the contacts on each earpiece before charging!  Being used to an earbud style for any type of device in my ear, I was a bit nervous about putting the earpiece into my ear.  The directions said to hold your ear and pull it straight with your other hand to help insert the earpiece.  That technique worked great.  Once they are in your ears you don’t realize they are there.  I know they work because I only have to turn the television to one third the volume I do when I’m not wearing them.  Connecting to my phone was easy.  In the Bluetooth area the “Go Ultra” device simply showed up.  (The hearing aids were on and in my ears when I did this).  When making a phone call the Go Ultra device shows up on the phone just like “Speaker” so you can choose to use them for the phone call or not.  All in all, they work well and are easy to use.  The charging case charges even when it’s not plugged in (if the case has been charged) which is great for travel.  One item that takes a bit of getting used to is the retention wire that is used to help remove the dome from the ear.  If it sticks out too far, like it did when I first tried the hearing aids, then you need to insert the dome  into the ear.  Remember they are not earbuds!  I called customer service to inquire about the retention wire because it was sticking out past my ear.  I didn’t believe the recording when it said the wait time was 9 seconds.  The call was answered by a real person in about 3 seconds.  (Yes, I timed them).   Amazing in this day and age!"
88,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Nice to hear again!!,"I like my Go Ultra OTC hearing aids! I can hear better. Still adjusting to all the different things I can hear that I couldn't before. They have blutooth! That's nice! I can watch videos or listen to music without bothering anyone with loud volume. The only thing I don't like is while blutooth is active I can still hear everything else. It's not what I thought. It's not really a bad thing. Just threw me off at first. If you know you don't hear well, I recommend them!!"

88,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Bid Improvement,Took a little bit to tune in but that’s due to me. Very pleased to be able to hear again. My hearing is terrible and these hearing aids have made a big difference. Only problem I have is having to buy batteries since I didn’t purchase 250.00 charging unit
88,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Go Ultra OTC Hearing Aids,"I received the Go Hearing, Go Ultra OTC Hearing Aids in Gray. They seem to be well made and durable. They are comfortable to wear, don't fall out easily. I don't think they are right for my situation though, as I had a lot of whistling noises and my own voice was very amplified. I only have hearing loss in one ear.

Now I let my mother try them as she has more hearing loss than I do in both ears, and she said they were very clear, no noises or voice amplified and worked just as good as the ones she uses regularly.

Go Ultra hearing aids come in a nicely designed box with a compact recharge case that could easily fit in a bag or purse, it includes your hearing aids, an instruction manual, and several different tube lengths and dome tips.

Go Ultra comes with rechargeable batteries and allows 20 hours of battery life per charge.
allows Bluetooth streaming to iPhone and Android devices, does not allow customization to your specific hearing loss. Instead, the device has four pre-set programs, does not have a smartphone app. All adjustments are made through buttons on the back of the device.

Go Ultra has two buttons on each device. Here is a quick rundown of what each button does. 
Top Button - a 3-second press turns the hearing aids on and off a quick press and release increases the volume 
Bottom button - a 3-second press changes programs, a quick press and release decrease the volume, a quick press and release accepts or ends phone calls.

Go Ultra is worth a look if you are on a tight budget, have mild-moderate hearing loss, and need a device for simple listening situations like TV-watching."
88,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Very comfortable and work well,"These hearing aids work well and are very comfortable.  Setup is straightforward.  Out of the box, the first thing to do is charge them, which takes about three hours in the included charging case.  When I charged mine, they were ready to go in less than an hour.

The charging case holds the two aids only one way, so inserting them is no problem, and the case itself is charged along with the aids when plugged into the wall.  The case itself can then be used to charge the aids up to three time (according to the manual) if you’re away from a wall outlet.

To set up the aids for your ears, you begin by using the included “ear measuring tool,” which is a piece of L-shaped cardboard that hangs over your ear and measures the distance from the top of the location where your ear attaches to your head to the top of your ear canal.  The range of measurements is “1,” “2,” or “3,” and I am a 3.  The result of this measurement determines which of the three “ear tubes” you attach to the aids.

You then select the desired “ear dome” that attaches to the side of the aid that is inserted in your ear.  There are two types of domes, “open” and “closed,” where the choice depends on the type of results you want to experience.  The open dome is for more “natural” sound, while the closed dome emphasizes the bass registers, according to the manual.  Each dome type comes in three sizes. I use the open domes.

Inserting the aids in your ears is simple as they can go in only one way. Slide the top part of the aid (with the two control buttons) over your ear, insert the other end into your ear, and hook the little plastic wire attached to the aid around inside your outer ear to brace the aid in place.  I have found these aids, after three day of use, to be so comfortable that I forget that they’re there.  Wearing a pair of glasses over them is no issue at all.

The aids are turned on by a three-second press of one of the two buttons on each one.  The devices will say “power on,” and you’re off and running.  There are ten volume settings that you select by pressing the volume-up or volume-down buttons one step at a time.  After each press, the aids beep once to indicate that a new volume level has been selected.  When you reach the maximum or minimum, they beep three times.  I find that setting the volume levels at about the half-way point is best for me.  At the higher volume levels, the sound can be quite loud and shrill.

My hearing loss is considered mild and is concentrated at the higher frequencies. I also have been finding it more difficult to hear conversations in a noisy room.  So far, after three days of use, I’m finding it much easier to hear what’s going on around me.

In addition to acting as hearing aids, these units also feature Bluetooth capability, and they can be paired with your smartphone or any Bluetooth device.  Pairing them with my phone was a snap, and I can now both listen to music or whatever over my hearing aids as well as hearing the person I’m speaking with on a phone call.  

People with hearing aids are precluded from using earbuds because both need to be inserted into the ear to use, and there is room, obviously, for only one.  The combined capability of these aids neatly solves this problem. The one drawback to using the Bluetooth feature is that it greatly shortens the battery life.  I’ve not had a chance to test this, but the manual says that, without using Bluetooth, the batteries should last about 20 hours between charges.  When using Bluetooth, that drops to eight hours.

The box includes thin cleaning wires which are used to clean the ear tubes should the become clogged with wax.  I recommend keeping these handy as I have already needed them once.

Overall, I strongly recommend that anyone with mild hearing loss give these a try."

88,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Very happy,"So after getting about a week of use to give a fair and balanced review and opinion of these hearing aids there are some goods and only one real bad that i can find. Now i have a second set of hearing aids and i will not go into those but i'm kind of using those as a reference for these new ones i got. So first these come with a built in charger and when you put them in there case for the night you have a fully charged set,so you save some money because you do not need to buy hearing aid batteries and that's a big plus with these. My other ones you need to replace the batteries and they only last about two days of constant use. The sound quality is outstanding and also you do not need to have them set up with bluetooth with your phone unless you are going to stream music with them also then you need to set them up via bluetooth but not a big deal but it's nice if your picking them up only as hearing aids. I'll be honest with you the big appeal of these was the fact i can use them to stream music at work vs having my hearing aid and a set of earbuds also on me. I can use them as my go to hearing aids and earbuds for music and that is a very nice plus. But and you know there is always a but and that is if you use them only as hearing aids the battery life is great like 20 hours plus but if you stream with them it knocks the battery life down to about 4 hours. Bluetooth is very demanding for power and i know there is another way you can stream with earbuds a setting that they have to come with and it hooks up but not bluetooth and unfortunately these don't have them. It's not a big deal for me because i only listen to music for about 2 hours so by the time i am able to listen to them there is still a lot of battery power left. So al in all im am super happy with them. The streaming volume is not as loud as earbuds are but it's loud enough to stream your music."
88,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Comfortable and discreet,"I have been using the go hearing go uktra for a few weeks now and have loved the comfort of them. They are lightweight and fit really well in my ear and around it. Unlike others these dont irritate or bother me when wearing them for long periods of time. These come as a set, they come with a charging case with cable and adapter, open and closed domes as well as slim tubes. I love that the tubes are very discreet and are barely noticeable when wearing. As someone whose self consious of having to wear a hearing aid, this was my favorite feature. I love that it comes with a charging case because every night i can put them in the case to charge and not risk losing them or misplacing them. I can use them all day on one charge which is very convenient for me as im constantly on the go! I also love that i am able to stream calls, music, and even my social medias while wearing them! I have been able to hear great with these and they have helped tremendously with my hearing when i need it. Overall i highly reccomend the gonhearing go ultra hearing aids because they are comfortable and discreet and provide you the hearing that you deserve to have!"
88,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Improved hearing at a reasonable price point,"Go Hearing - Go Ultra OTC Hearing Aids – Gray

It’s certainly reassuring when the first thing you see when you open the box on these over-the-counter hearing aids is a blue card stating “Need Assistance? We’re here to help.” Included on that card is a phone number and web site URL where you can go for expert assistance. That’s a nice and welcome touch, since you usually need to go digging around for that information on many other products when you need help.

At first glance, the 48-page Go Ultra OTC hearing aid user manual seemed like a lot to digest. However, once I started reading through it, I realized that it was taking me, step-by-step, though the setup and use of these hearing aids. When I finished reading it, I felt that I had a very good understanding of the product, so I didn’t have to wonder how things worked. Very impressive and comforting! 

The unit comes with a portable charging/carrying/storage case which was already partially charged upon arrival. In less than an hour, I had three green lights, indicating that the charging unit itself and the two hearing aids inside were fully charged. It takes about three hours to get a full charge and under normal use, that full charge is supposed to last about 20 hours, depending on how you’ve set things up and how much you’ve used them. I prefer rechargeable hearing aids like these over the type that require installing special batteries, but that’s a personal preference. I find that it’s much easier to locate an outlet to plug the charging case into than it is to find a store that sells the special batteries that some hearing aids operate on.

These hearing aids come with multiple size ear domes (four each of small, medium, and large sizes) and six slim tubes (two each of sizes 1, 2 and 3) to help make sure you get the best fit. 

While you may have to try on the different ear domes to decide which one gives you the best fit, there’s a measuring guide for both the right and left ear that lets you know which of the three slim tubes is the appropriate size without you having to try each of them on. However, you may find that the ones pre-installed on the hearing aids work just fine for you. That’s what happened in our case.

While some similar devices use a phone app to control and adjust the various settings, these hearing aids don’t require any outside devices to control things. Instead, it has four built-in preset programs that you can choose from by simply toggling between them, using the built-in buttons located on the rear of the hearing aids. And then, the next time you use the hearing aids, it remembers and uses the last program and settings you used.

Once setup is complete and you’ve got your settings where you want them, the real test comes when you’re ready to try out these hearing aids under multiple conditions. My wife, who suffers from moderate hearing loss, used these under different conditions and found that they work well at improving her everyday listening. Her only initial problem was trying to remember what all the different presses of the control buttons on the rear of the hearing aids do. To help her with that, I made her a “cheat sheet” copy from the user’s manual. And I can also confirm that these hearing aids seem to be working well, since I no longer hear “What did you say?” whenever I speak to her.

And finally, it’s good to know that they come with a one-year warranty on both parts and labor.

Over-the-counter hearing aids are here to stay, and these Go Ultra OTC hearing aids could certainly be a good choice for those who prefer the behind-the-ear style."
88,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,"Go Ultra, Go Comfort!","These Go Ultra OTC Hearing Aids from Go Hearing have actually surprised me in a good way.  I initially thought because I wear glasses, I needed hearing aids that weren’t over-the-ear.  I was wrong.  If I simply put in the new Go Ultras first and then my glasses, I may get an initial clanking noise (not if I’m careful) when the temple bars of my glasses makes contact with the body of the aids, but that’s it for the rest of the day.  Cool.  And since we’re on the topic of comfort, these are SO much more comfortable than an all-in-the-ear-canal micro-aid I’ve also given a try…and much less, if any, feedback.  Wearing them all day doesn’t seem to cause any irritation/discomfort that I’ve experienced in the past. 

Let’s talk about being inconspicuous.  My silvery white hair flows ever-so-gracefully down to the top and around the back of my ears.  (I paid a lot for these highlights!)  I wore the new set of Go Ultra aids all day and no one in my family noticed them.  I had to point them out.

Charging case — These aids are so much more flexible to live with on a daily basis because they are rechargeable.  I hate having to change out hearing aid batteries, and their cost, and their disposal, etc., etc.  With the Go Ultras, you don’t have to worry about that.

These aids come with a plethora of different sized ear plugs, tubes, and cleaning tools.  All good.  I’ll advise you now to be patient when going through the setup and sizing.  It takes time and some experimentation.  You may become frustrated at first, but once you find the magic fit, you’re set.  It’s worth the little bit of hassle at the outset.

There are a couple things I wish were different —

First, when going through the setup, if you find that you need a different sized tube, you may find it difficult to turn and separate the tube from the main body of the hearing aid.  I finally got it, but it wasn’t easy.  Do NOT pull on the tube itself.  Follow the instructions (which I thought were pretty well written by someone who seemed to have a decent grasp of the English language.  That’s rare these days).  The silicone buds were much easier to deal with — and they give you two styles, open and closed.  Since I have one ear much worse than the other, I’ve actually gone with the closed style on my bad side, and open on the other.  Nice to have the option.

That last thing that bothers me a bit is the battery life when using a bluetooth connection.  It’s awesome that you can connect with your phone to make or answer calls, or stream music.  But doing so quickly uses battery power.  You can go from lasting all day (10-12 hrs just as a hearing aid), to lasting 3-4 hours if you’re constantly streaming or talking on the phone.  I’ve found it easier for me to simply pull the Go Ultra bud out of my ear and talk on the phone as I normally would.  Using the speakerphone works, as well (as is the hands-free phone in the car.)

If you're considering trying some OTC before spending thousands, Go Ultra is worth the try.  If they work for you, like they do for me, it can be life-changing."
88,BestBuy,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,Comfortable,"This pair of hearing aids are comfortable for me to wear and the style I prefer.  Personally I prefer those around to know that I do have hearing loss.  Using ones that go in the ear (like earbuds) I get questioned at work with them and have to explain they are hearing aids.  I also have a lump in my left ear wear those sit and so they are always coming out.  With this style, they are behind my ear and then they have the part that goes directly into the ear canal.  They don’t come out as easy and if they do, they are still held in place and don’t fall to the ground.  I also like that they were easy to connect to phone and you can use these as hearing aides but also to listen to apps like YouTube and to take calls.  However, that is it for me as far as positive things. 

Sound quality was super quiet for me.  And even worse if they did come out even a little. I felt I could hear more without these.  All of the other hearing aids I have get much louder.  These do not have an app to adjust settings as well.  I was hoping that because they are made by Lexie that the Lexie app would work but it did not.  An app would have been nice to do a simple test for each ear and then adjust them from that.  As well as just to adjust in general.  This is a bigger deal for me as what good are hearing aids is you can’t hear with them.

The case is a bit bulky as well, but I like that they are rechargeable and the case acts like a battery back up to charge them.  The cord though could be a little longer as it’s short.  

These I give a 2 star just for the comfort and because they were easy to connect and when connected they allow you to use with apps."
88,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Improved my hearing and it streams !,"I have used other OTC hearing aids and I find these to be far superior. 

Out of the box the hearing aids performed perfectly. You must read he included user manual to check for proper fitting and the purpose of the two push buttons. The only thing I changed was the dome and I changed it to small. I did not have to change the slim tubes but two others of different lengths are included in the box. Medium and large domes are included in the package along with a cleaning tool. 

The is no APP. The units have 4 preset settings, Normal to boost all sounds, high-frequency boost, low frequency boost and General which the manual said is for steaming music. My particular hearing loss requires a high-frequency boost and this setting works just fine for me. I vary the volume as necessary depending on my environment.

 When paired with my Android phone I am able to answer calls and actually hear the person and the callers hear me just fine. I can also stream music and it sounds great. My other OTC hearing aids ( which cost more )  do not have any streaming either for music or phone calls. It has been my experience that constant streaming music and talking on phone will reduce battery life to around 3-4 hours. Normal use will last all day. I charge them at night. 

Left and right hearing aids can be adjusted separately for volume and the 4 sound presets directly from the device. Again, no APP is provided or needed. That is not possible with my current OTC hearing aids that require an internet connection to make significant parameter changes. Again, a big plus for this product.

The units were charged upon arrival. The very odd thing is the charging case. The case has a battery that allows me to charge the hearing aids  around 3 times without having it plugged in. That is very convenient  In order to recharge the case battery you must connect the charging cable to the bottom of the case so you have to lay it on its side. How can such a well thought out product have this, in my opinion, design flaw. There are LED’s on the case that provide status of the hearing aid battery and the charging case battery. 

The streaming is a game changer. I no longer have to put up with feedback when holding my phone up to my ear with my other OTC hearing aids. I can not go back to my other OTC hearing aids. I have been spoiled with this great product, it has far exceeded my expectations for an OTC hearing aid."

After initial charging set-up one took a few minutes. The hearing aids are light weight and did not cause any discomfort during prolonged use. After adjusting the sound level to my liking, I was done with the set-up. I wore the hearing aids for 10 hours doing normal everyday things. The next day I put them back in and forgot they were there. 
The Go Ultra Hearing Aids are Bluetooth enabled. You can pair them to your phone or device. It was a strange feeling pairing to the phone, as I could hear the phone in both ears. This made the conversation easier to follow as I have better hearing in one ear than the other.
The Go Ultra Hearing Aids also have built in noise reduction. Battery life is expected to be 20 hours without Bluetooth. With Bluetooth enabled by not in use you can get about 8 hours. Streaming cuts it down to 2.5 to 3 hours. To fully charge the batteries place them back in the case and it takes up to 3 hours to recharge.
The Go Ultra Hearing Aids comes with a 45-day return policy. Try them and you will love them."
88,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Go Hearing - Go Ultra OTC Hearing Aids,"So I received my Go Hearing - Go Ultra OTC Hearing Aids about a week ago and have been putting them through their paces. Now I have not been properly diagnosed with any type of hearing loss, though, I have known myself for awhile that my dominant ear is my right ear, which means there has to be some hearing loss in my left ear.

Upon opening the box, you will find:

* Go Hearing Go Ultra OTC Hearing Aids (1 pair: Left & Right)
* Charging Case with Charging Cable & Adaptor
* Open Domes (2 Small, 2 Medium, and 2 Large)
* Closed Domes (2 Small, 2 Medium, and 2 Large)
* Slim Tube (2 Small, 2 Medium, and 2 Large)
* Cleaning Wire
* Cleaning Brush
* Ear Measurement Tool
* User Manual

To get  started, simply follow along with the User Manual. It's best to ensure the hearing aids are fully charged before using them. Once fully charged, these hearing aids are really to pair and connect with your smartphone. Something I noticed right off the bat is that there was no app to download, install, and create a user profile. I like that. It's simply hold to power them on and pair them through your bluetooth settings in your phone or other mobile device as you would any other bluetooth device. Using the included ear measurement tool will help with ensure you have the right sized slim tube. The tubes are a little hard to remove and replace, though with a little patience you should be able to remove the old slim tube and connect the right tube for proper fitting. After installing the correct slim tube, now you can replace the ear domes and choose from whether you prefer open domes or the closed domes. The closed domes seemed to work better for me. Your mileage may vary.

After proper fit and installation of the proper slim tubes and domes, you're ready to go. Initially i found the sound to be very teeny until I got the correct tubes and domes installed and was able to hear much better and clearer. And they feel wonderful in my ears. Each hearing aid works independent of one another, which is something that I absolutely love. I can wear the right one and keep the left one charged or vice versa. Or wear both of them at the same time. 

A couple of great features that I love about the Go Ultra OTC hearing aids aside from them working independent of one another, is the fact that they stream music flawlessly without any issue. Calls were clear and not muffled like I've had on other more expensive hearing aid sets. One thing I would like to see, is an easier way to remove the slim wires, it took me a few minutes to remove these, but I managed. Other than that they are a decent budget pair of hearing aids that I will use."
88,BestBuy,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,You get what you pay for,"Made by Lexie, the Go Ultra is a pair of simple to use, relatively inexpensive, over-the-counter (OTC) hearing aids, but they are hearing aids with some major drawbacks.

The units are reasonably sized for OTC rechargeables, and are very lightweight. Much like earbuds, they have a charging case that serves as a battery pack for charging the hearing aids. The case itself is charged using a standard USB-C cable. A single charge to the Go Ultra will last about 22 hours, according to the company.

Setup is relatively simple, following the pattern of most over-the-ear, OTC hearing aids. For physical fit, you use a sizer to determine the proper length of wire and select the appropriate dome. Each hearing aid has a power button that doubles as volume up and a program select button that doubles as a sound profile selector. And those rudimentary settings are part of the problem with the Go Ultra. Each hearing aid is adjusted individually, and they remember your previous settings between charges.

Everyone has a hearing profile, where certain frequencies are diminished and others are clear. A hearing test, either on your phone, on-line, or through an audiologist, will help you determine your profile. But the Go Ultra doesn't have any of these tests, but instead uses a rather crude series of sound profiles; normal, high frequency, low frequency, and high gain (like normal, but with additional volume boosting). If, like me, you have low and high frequency loss, there is no setting that works properly. In fact, it’s hard to imagine who has hearing loss that matches these broad settings. It’s like trying to paint trim with a roller.

The Go Ultra will connect via Bluetooth, and connection is simple. You can then stream music and take calls, although no one is going to confuse these with quality earbuds. It also appears that the streaming sound is not impacted by the selected sound profile. If you have trouble hearing high frequencies in your music, you will still have issues hearing high frequencies in your music.

But, the main purpose of any hearing aid is to help your hearing, and this is where I had real issues with the Go Ultra. Voices, rustling paper, and other common sounds were harsh and artificial sounding. In fact, so long as the volume of the person speaking was not too soft I could hear conversations better unaided than with these. My own voice was abnormally amplified. I have worn a single hearing aid for about a decade, and this is the first time I’ve experienced this. Sounds were also slightly delayed. With two hearing aids in things weren’t overly bad, but with one in there was a ricochet effect, where the unassisted ear heard things a fraction of a second earlier than the aided ear. Most likely the effect of a slow processor in the hearing aids, t was, at best, distracting.

Most people are probably going to be a lot better off with something else. Yes, a better set will undoubtably cost quite a bit more, but sometimes you really do get exactly what you pay for."
88,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Go Hearing's Ultra OTC Hearing Aids Are Quite Good,"I received a pair of Go Hearing - Go Ultra OTC Hearing Aids to use, test and review with the review to be posted on Best Buy's website.

As I am very hard of hearing and also have tinnitus, I was very interested in Go Hearing's latest product as, to date, I have not found the perfect pair of hearing aids for my hearing condition and have not been fully satisfied with any of them I've tried before. 

The grey-colored Go Hearing Ultra OTC Hearing Aids arrived nicely boxed, with a rechargeable case for the hearing aids to nest in. The case acts as a charging station so no batteries are needed. These hearing aids are designed for use not, only to hear better, but also allow Buetooth connecction with smarphones allowing listening to digital music, podcasts and acceptance of phones calls while wearing. The Go Hearing Ultra are considerably less expensive than most prescription hearing aids with more features than many.

The Go Hearing Ultra Hearing Aids are grey in color and sit behind each ear making them somewhat inconspicuous. The fit via clear plastic tubing into your ear canal and come packaged with a number of different size in-ear buds to allow the user to find the perfect fit for their ears. Volume controls and a button to accept phone calls is positioned on the behind-ear hearing aid units making it easy and convenient to control the use of the hearing aids.

I only have one issue with the Go Hearing Ultra hearing aids - the inability to adjust the sound quality - treble, medium and bass. Other than that these are very good hearing aid units for the price!"
88,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Work Well and Easy to Use,"Reading through the included manual it does not tell me to install an app.  WooHoo!  A product that doesn’t need an app to work.  I plugged them in to charge.  Turns out they are shipped with a bit of paper covering the contacts!  So be sure to remove the paper from the contacts on each earpiece before charging!  Being used to an earbud style for any type of device in my ear, I was a bit nervous about putting the earpiece into my ear.  The directions said to hold your ear and pull it straight with your other hand to help insert the earpiece.  That technique worked great.  Once they are in your ears you don’t realize they are there.  I know they work because I only have to turn the television to one third the volume I do when I’m not wearing them.  Connecting to my phone was easy.  In the Bluetooth area the “Go Ultra” device simply showed up.  (The hearing aids were on and in my ears when I did this).  When making a phone call the Go Ultra device shows up on the phone just like “Speaker” so you can choose to use them for the phone call or not.  All in all, they work well and are easy to use.  The charging case charges even when it’s not plugged in (if the case has been charged) which is great for travel.  One item that takes a bit of getting used to is the retention wire that is used to help remove the dome from the ear.  If it sticks out too far, like it did when I first tried the hearing aids, then you need to insert the dome  into the ear.  Remember they are not earbuds!  I called customer service to inquire about the retention wire because it was sticking out past my ear.  I didn’t believe the recording when it said the wait time was 9 seconds.  The call was answered by a real person in about 3 seconds.  (Yes, I timed them).   Amazing in this day and age!"
88,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Nice to hear again!!,"I like my Go Ultra OTC hearing aids! I can hear better. Still adjusting to all the different things I can hear that I couldn't before. They have blutooth! That's nice! I can watch videos or listen to music without bothering anyone with loud volume. The only thing I don't like is while blutooth is active I can still hear everything else. It's not what I thought. It's not really a bad thing. Just threw me off at first. If you know you don't hear well, I recommend them!!"
88,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Nice little device,Great device for hearing! It sounds clear and plenty loud.
88,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Ear amplifier,Takes a lot of adjusting. I have a problem with volume and feedback. Still working on it.
88,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Bid Improvement,Took a little bit to tune in but that’s due to me. Very pleased to be able to hear again. My hearing is terrible and these hearing aids have made a big difference. Only problem I have is having to buy batteries since I didn’t purchase 250.00 charging unit
88,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Go Ultra OTC Hearing Aids,"I received the Go Hearing, Go Ultra OTC Hearing Aids in Gray. They seem to be well made and durable. They are comfortable to wear, don't fall out easily. I don't think they are right for my situation though, as I had a lot of whistling noises and my own voice was very amplified. I only have hearing loss in one ear.

Now I let my mother try them as she has more hearing loss than I do in both ears, and she said they were very clear, no noises or voice amplified and worked just as good as the ones she uses regularly.

Go Ultra hearing aids come in a nicely designed box with a compact recharge case that could easily fit in a bag or purse, it includes your hearing aids, an instruction manual, and several different tube lengths and dome tips.

Go Ultra comes with rechargeable batteries and allows 20 hours of battery life per charge.
allows Bluetooth streaming to iPhone and Android devices, does not allow customization to your specific hearing loss. Instead, the device has four pre-set programs, does not have a smartphone app. All adjustments are made through buttons on the back of the device.

Go Ultra has two buttons on each device. Here is a quick rundown of what each button does. 
Top Button - a 3-second press turns the hearing aids on and off a quick press and release increases the volume 
Bottom button - a 3-second press changes programs, a quick press and release decrease the volume, a quick press and release accepts or ends phone calls.

Go Ultra is worth a look if you are on a tight budget, have mild-moderate hearing loss, and need a device for simple listening situations like TV-watching."
88,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Very comfortable and work well,"These hearing aids work well and are very comfortable.  Setup is straightforward.  Out of the box, the first thing to do is charge them, which takes about three hours in the included charging case.  When I charged mine, they were ready to go in less than an hour.

The charging case holds the two aids only one way, so inserting them is no problem, and the case itself is charged along with the aids when plugged into the wall.  The case itself can then be used to charge the aids up to three time (according to the manual) if you’re away from a wall outlet.

To set up the aids for your ears, you begin by using the included “ear measuring tool,” which is a piece of L-shaped cardboard that hangs over your ear and measures the distance from the top of the location where your ear attaches to your head to the top of your ear canal.  The range of measurements is “1,” “2,” or “3,” and I am a 3.  The result of this measurement determines which of the three “ear tubes” you attach to the aids.

You then select the desired “ear dome” that attaches to the side of the aid that is inserted in your ear.  There are two types of domes, “open” and “closed,” where the choice depends on the type of results you want to experience.  The open dome is for more “natural” sound, while the closed dome emphasizes the bass registers, according to the manual.  Each dome type comes in three sizes. I use the open domes.

Inserting the aids in your ears is simple as they can go in only one way. Slide the top part of the aid (with the two control buttons) over your ear, insert the other end into your ear, and hook the little plastic wire attached to the aid around inside your outer ear to brace the aid in place.  I have found these aids, after three day of use, to be so comfortable that I forget that they’re there.  Wearing a pair of glasses over them is no issue at all.

The aids are turned on by a three-second press of one of the two buttons on each one.  The devices will say “power on,” and you’re off and running.  There are ten volume settings that you select by pressing the volume-up or volume-down buttons one step at a time.  After each press, the aids beep once to indicate that a new volume level has been selected.  When you reach the maximum or minimum, they beep three times.  I find that setting the volume levels at about the half-way point is best for me.  At the higher volume levels, the sound can be quite loud and shrill.

My hearing loss is considered mild and is concentrated at the higher frequencies. I also have been finding it more difficult to hear conversations in a noisy room.  So far, after three days of use, I’m finding it much easier to hear what’s going on around me.

In addition to acting as hearing aids, these units also feature Bluetooth capability, and they can be paired with your smartphone or any Bluetooth device.  Pairing them with my phone was a snap, and I can now both listen to music or whatever over my hearing aids as well as hearing the person I’m speaking with on a phone call.  

People with hearing aids are precluded from using earbuds because both need to be inserted into the ear to use, and there is room, obviously, for only one.  The combined capability of these aids neatly solves this problem. The one drawback to using the Bluetooth feature is that it greatly shortens the battery life.  I’ve not had a chance to test this, but the manual says that, without using Bluetooth, the batteries should last about 20 hours between charges.  When using Bluetooth, that drops to eight hours.

The box includes thin cleaning wires which are used to clean the ear tubes should the become clogged with wax.  I recommend keeping these handy as I have already needed them once.

Overall, I strongly recommend that anyone with mild hearing loss give these a try."

88,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Very happy,"So after getting about a week of use to give a fair and balanced review and opinion of these hearing aids there are some goods and only one real bad that i can find. Now i have a second set of hearing aids and i will not go into those but i'm kind of using those as a reference for these new ones i got. So first these come with a built in charger and when you put them in there case for the night you have a fully charged set,so you save some money because you do not need to buy hearing aid batteries and that's a big plus with these. My other ones you need to replace the batteries and they only last about two days of constant use. The sound quality is outstanding and also you do not need to have them set up with bluetooth with your phone unless you are going to stream music with them also then you need to set them up via bluetooth but not a big deal but it's nice if your picking them up only as hearing aids. I'll be honest with you the big appeal of these was the fact i can use them to stream music at work vs having my hearing aid and a set of earbuds also on me. I can use them as my go to hearing aids and earbuds for music and that is a very nice plus. But and you know there is always a but and that is if you use them only as hearing aids the battery life is great like 20 hours plus but if you stream with them it knocks the battery life down to about 4 hours. Bluetooth is very demanding for power and i know there is another way you can stream with earbuds a setting that they have to come with and it hooks up but not bluetooth and unfortunately these don't have them. It's not a big deal for me because i only listen to music for about 2 hours so by the time i am able to listen to them there is still a lot of battery power left. So al in all im am super happy with them. The streaming volume is not as loud as earbuds are but it's loud enough to stream your music."
88,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Comfortable and discreet,"I have been using the go hearing go uktra for a few weeks now and have loved the comfort of them. They are lightweight and fit really well in my ear and around it. Unlike others these dont irritate or bother me when wearing them for long periods of time. These come as a set, they come with a charging case with cable and adapter, open and closed domes as well as slim tubes. I love that the tubes are very discreet and are barely noticeable when wearing. As someone whose self consious of having to wear a hearing aid, this was my favorite feature. I love that it comes with a charging case because every night i can put them in the case to charge and not risk losing them or misplacing them. I can use them all day on one charge which is very convenient for me as im constantly on the go! I also love that i am able to stream calls, music, and even my social medias while wearing them! I have been able to hear great with these and they have helped tremendously with my hearing when i need it. Overall i highly reccomend the gonhearing go ultra hearing aids because they are comfortable and discreet and provide you the hearing that you deserve to have!"
88,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Improved hearing at a reasonable price point,"Go Hearing - Go Ultra OTC Hearing Aids – Gray

It’s certainly reassuring when the first thing you see when you open the box on these over-the-counter hearing aids is a blue card stating “Need Assistance? We’re here to help.” Included on that card is a phone number and web site URL where you can go for expert assistance. That’s a nice and welcome touch, since you usually need to go digging around for that information on many other products when you need help.

At first glance, the 48-page Go Ultra OTC hearing aid user manual seemed like a lot to digest. However, once I started reading through it, I realized that it was taking me, step-by-step, though the setup and use of these hearing aids. When I finished reading it, I felt that I had a very good understanding of the product, so I didn’t have to wonder how things worked. Very impressive and comforting! 

The unit comes with a portable charging/carrying/storage case which was already partially charged upon arrival. In less than an hour, I had three green lights, indicating that the charging unit itself and the two hearing aids inside were fully charged. It takes about three hours to get a full charge and under normal use, that full charge is supposed to last about 20 hours, depending on how you’ve set things up and how much you’ve used them. I prefer rechargeable hearing aids like these over the type that require installing special batteries, but that’s a personal preference. I find that it’s much easier to locate an outlet to plug the charging case into than it is to find a store that sells the special batteries that some hearing aids operate on.

These hearing aids come with multiple size ear domes (four each of small, medium, and large sizes) and six slim tubes (two each of sizes 1, 2 and 3) to help make sure you get the best fit. 

While you may have to try on the different ear domes to decide which one gives you the best fit, there’s a measuring guide for both the right and left ear that lets you know which of the three slim tubes is the appropriate size without you having to try each of them on. However, you may find that the ones pre-installed on the hearing aids work just fine for you. That’s what happened in our case.

While some similar devices use a phone app to control and adjust the various settings, these hearing aids don’t require any outside devices to control things. Instead, it has four built-in preset programs that you can choose from by simply toggling between them, using the built-in buttons located on the rear of the hearing aids. And then, the next time you use the hearing aids, it remembers and uses the last program and settings you used.

Once setup is complete and you’ve got your settings where you want them, the real test comes when you’re ready to try out these hearing aids under multiple conditions. My wife, who suffers from moderate hearing loss, used these under different conditions and found that they work well at improving her everyday listening. Her only initial problem was trying to remember what all the different presses of the control buttons on the rear of the hearing aids do. To help her with that, I made her a “cheat sheet” copy from the user’s manual. And I can also confirm that these hearing aids seem to be working well, since I no longer hear “What did you say?” whenever I speak to her.

And finally, it’s good to know that they come with a one-year warranty on both parts and labor.

Over-the-counter hearing aids are here to stay, and these Go Ultra OTC hearing aids could certainly be a good choice for those who prefer the behind-the-ear style."
88,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,"Go Ultra, Go Comfort!","These Go Ultra OTC Hearing Aids from Go Hearing have actually surprised me in a good way.  I initially thought because I wear glasses, I needed hearing aids that weren’t over-the-ear.  I was wrong.  If I simply put in the new Go Ultras first and then my glasses, I may get an initial clanking noise (not if I’m careful) when the temple bars of my glasses makes contact with the body of the aids, but that’s it for the rest of the day.  Cool.  And since we’re on the topic of comfort, these are SO much more comfortable than an all-in-the-ear-canal micro-aid I’ve also given a try…and much less, if any, feedback.  Wearing them all day doesn’t seem to cause any irritation/discomfort that I’ve experienced in the past. 

Let’s talk about being inconspicuous.  My silvery white hair flows ever-so-gracefully down to the top and around the back of my ears.  (I paid a lot for these highlights!)  I wore the new set of Go Ultra aids all day and no one in my family noticed them.  I had to point them out.

Charging case — These aids are so much more flexible to live with on a daily basis because they are rechargeable.  I hate having to change out hearing aid batteries, and their cost, and their disposal, etc., etc.  With the Go Ultras, you don’t have to worry about that.

These aids come with a plethora of different sized ear plugs, tubes, and cleaning tools.  All good.  I’ll advise you now to be patient when going through the setup and sizing.  It takes time and some experimentation.  You may become frustrated at first, but once you find the magic fit, you’re set.  It’s worth the little bit of hassle at the outset.

There are a couple things I wish were different —

First, when going through the setup, if you find that you need a different sized tube, you may find it difficult to turn and separate the tube from the main body of the hearing aid.  I finally got it, but it wasn’t easy.  Do NOT pull on the tube itself.  Follow the instructions (which I thought were pretty well written by someone who seemed to have a decent grasp of the English language.  That’s rare these days).  The silicone buds were much easier to deal with — and they give you two styles, open and closed.  Since I have one ear much worse than the other, I’ve actually gone with the closed style on my bad side, and open on the other.  Nice to have the option.

That last thing that bothers me a bit is the battery life when using a bluetooth connection.  It’s awesome that you can connect with your phone to make or answer calls, or stream music.  But doing so quickly uses battery power.  You can go from lasting all day (10-12 hrs just as a hearing aid), to lasting 3-4 hours if you’re constantly streaming or talking on the phone.  I’ve found it easier for me to simply pull the Go Ultra bud out of my ear and talk on the phone as I normally would.  Using the speakerphone works, as well (as is the hands-free phone in the car.)

If you're considering trying some OTC before spending thousands, Go Ultra is worth the try.  If they work for you, like they do for me, it can be life-changing."
88,BestBuy,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,Comfortable,"This pair of hearing aids are comfortable for me to wear and the style I prefer.  Personally I prefer those around to know that I do have hearing loss.  Using ones that go in the ear (like earbuds) I get questioned at work with them and have to explain they are hearing aids.  I also have a lump in my left ear wear those sit and so they are always coming out.  With this style, they are behind my ear and then they have the part that goes directly into the ear canal.  They don’t come out as easy and if they do, they are still held in place and don’t fall to the ground.  I also like that they were easy to connect to phone and you can use these as hearing aides but also to listen to apps like YouTube and to take calls.  However, that is it for me as far as positive things. 

Sound quality was super quiet for me.  And even worse if they did come out even a little. I felt I could hear more without these.  All of the other hearing aids I have get much louder.  These do not have an app to adjust settings as well.  I was hoping that because they are made by Lexie that the Lexie app would work but it did not.  An app would have been nice to do a simple test for each ear and then adjust them from that.  As well as just to adjust in general.  This is a bigger deal for me as what good are hearing aids is you can’t hear with them.

The case is a bit bulky as well, but I like that they are rechargeable and the case acts like a battery back up to charge them.  The cord though could be a little longer as it’s short.  

These I give a 2 star just for the comfort and because they were easy to connect and when connected they allow you to use with apps."
88,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Improved my hearing and it streams !,"I have used other OTC hearing aids and I find these to be far superior. 

Out of the box the hearing aids performed perfectly. You must read he included user manual to check for proper fitting and the purpose of the two push buttons. The only thing I changed was the dome and I changed it to small. I did not have to change the slim tubes but two others of different lengths are included in the box. Medium and large domes are included in the package along with a cleaning tool. 

The is no APP. The units have 4 preset settings, Normal to boost all sounds, high-frequency boost, low frequency boost and General which the manual said is for steaming music. My particular hearing loss requires a high-frequency boost and this setting works just fine for me. I vary the volume as necessary depending on my environment.

 When paired with my Android phone I am able to answer calls and actually hear the person and the callers hear me just fine. I can also stream music and it sounds great. My other OTC hearing aids ( which cost more )  do not have any streaming either for music or phone calls. It has been my experience that constant streaming music and talking on phone will reduce battery life to around 3-4 hours. Normal use will last all day. I charge them at night. 

Left and right hearing aids can be adjusted separately for volume and the 4 sound presets directly from the device. Again, no APP is provided or needed. That is not possible with my current OTC hearing aids that require an internet connection to make significant parameter changes. Again, a big plus for this product.

The units were charged upon arrival. The very odd thing is the charging case. The case has a battery that allows me to charge the hearing aids  around 3 times without having it plugged in. That is very convenient  In order to recharge the case battery you must connect the charging cable to the bottom of the case so you have to lay it on its side. How can such a well thought out product have this, in my opinion, design flaw. There are LED’s on the case that provide status of the hearing aid battery and the charging case battery. 

The streaming is a game changer. I no longer have to put up with feedback when holding my phone up to my ear with my other OTC hearing aids. I can not go back to my other OTC hearing aids. I have been spoiled with this great product, it has far exceeded my expectations for an OTC hearing aid."

The charging case has 3 led lights; the center is for the case and the others for each hearing aid. Blue for charging and green for charged. I found that if the light does not illuminate the earpiece is not correctly mounted. 
After initial charging set-up one took a few minutes. The hearing aids are light weight and did not cause any discomfort during prolonged use. After adjusting the sound level to my liking, I was done with the set-up. I wore the hearing aids for 10 hours doing normal everyday things. The next day I put them back in and forgot they were there. 
The Go Ultra Hearing Aids are Bluetooth enabled. You can pair them to your phone or device. It was a strange feeling pairing to the phone, as I could hear the phone in both ears. This made the conversation easier to follow as I have better hearing in one ear than the other.
The Go Ultra Hearing Aids also have built in noise reduction. Battery life is expected to be 20 hours without Bluetooth. With Bluetooth enabled by not in use you can get about 8 hours. Streaming cuts it down to 2.5 to 3 hours. To fully charge the batteries place them back in the case and it takes up to 3 hours to recharge.
The Go Ultra Hearing Aids comes with a 45-day return policy. Try them and you will love them."
88,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Go Hearing - Go Ultra OTC Hearing Aids,"So I received my Go Hearing - Go Ultra OTC Hearing Aids about a week ago and have been putting them through their paces. Now I have not been properly diagnosed with any type of hearing loss, though, I have known myself for awhile that my dominant ear is my right ear, which means there has to be some hearing loss in my left ear.

Upon opening the box, you will find:

* Go Hearing Go Ultra OTC Hearing Aids (1 pair: Left & Right)
* Charging Case with Charging Cable & Adaptor
* Open Domes (2 Small, 2 Medium, and 2 Large)
* Closed Domes (2 Small, 2 Medium, and 2 Large)
* Slim Tube (2 Small, 2 Medium, and 2 Large)
* Cleaning Wire
* Cleaning Brush
* Ear Measurement Tool
* User Manual

To get  started, simply follow along with the User Manual. It's best to ensure the hearing aids are fully charged before using them. Once fully charged, these hearing aids are really to pair and connect with your smartphone. Something I noticed right off the bat is that there was no app to download, install, and create a user profile. I like that. It's simply hold to power them on and pair them through your bluetooth settings in your phone or other mobile device as you would any other bluetooth device. Using the included ear measurement tool will help with ensure you have the right sized slim tube. The tubes are a little hard to remove and replace, though with a little patience you should be able to remove the old slim tube and connect the right tube for proper fitting. After installing the correct slim tube, now you can replace the ear domes and choose from whether you prefer open domes or the closed domes. The closed domes seemed to work better for me. Your mileage may vary.

After proper fit and installation of the proper slim tubes and domes, you're ready to go. Initially i found the sound to be very teeny until I got the correct tubes and domes installed and was able to hear much better and clearer. And they feel wonderful in my ears. Each hearing aid works independent of one another, which is something that I absolutely love. I can wear the right one and keep the left one charged or vice versa. Or wear both of them at the same time. 

A couple of great features that I love about the Go Ultra OTC hearing aids aside from them working independent of one another, is the fact that they stream music flawlessly without any issue. Calls were clear and not muffled like I've had on other more expensive hearing aid sets. One thing I would like to see, is an easier way to remove the slim wires, it took me a few minutes to remove these, but I managed. Other than that they are a decent budget pair of hearing aids that I will use."
88,BestBuy,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,You get what you pay for,"Made by Lexie, the Go Ultra is a pair of simple to use, relatively inexpensive, over-the-counter (OTC) hearing aids, but they are hearing aids with some major drawbacks.

The units are reasonably sized for OTC rechargeables, and are very lightweight. Much like earbuds, they have a charging case that serves as a battery pack for charging the hearing aids. The case itself is charged using a standard USB-C cable. A single charge to the Go Ultra will last about 22 hours, according to the company.

Setup is relatively simple, following the pattern of most over-the-ear, OTC hearing aids. For physical fit, you use a sizer to determine the proper length of wire and select the appropriate dome. Each hearing aid has a power button that doubles as volume up and a program select button that doubles as a sound profile selector. And those rudimentary settings are part of the problem with the Go Ultra. Each hearing aid is adjusted individually, and they remember your previous settings between charges.

Everyone has a hearing profile, where certain frequencies are diminished and others are clear. A hearing test, either on your phone, on-line, or through an audiologist, will help you determine your profile. But the Go Ultra doesn't have any of these tests, but instead uses a rather crude series of sound profiles; normal, high frequency, low frequency, and high gain (like normal, but with additional volume boosting). If, like me, you have low and high frequency loss, there is no setting that works properly. In fact, it’s hard to imagine who has hearing loss that matches these broad settings. It’s like trying to paint trim with a roller.

The Go Ultra will connect via Bluetooth, and connection is simple. You can then stream music and take calls, although no one is going to confuse these with quality earbuds. It also appears that the streaming sound is not impacted by the selected sound profile. If you have trouble hearing high frequencies in your music, you will still have issues hearing high frequencies in your music.

But, the main purpose of any hearing aid is to help your hearing, and this is where I had real issues with the Go Ultra. Voices, rustling paper, and other common sounds were harsh and artificial sounding. In fact, so long as the volume of the person speaking was not too soft I could hear conversations better unaided than with these. My own voice was abnormally amplified. I have worn a single hearing aid for about a decade, and this is the first time I’ve experienced this. Sounds were also slightly delayed. With two hearing aids in things weren’t overly bad, but with one in there was a ricochet effect, where the unassisted ear heard things a fraction of a second earlier than the aided ear. Most likely the effect of a slow processor in the hearing aids, t was, at best, distracting.

Most people are probably going to be a lot better off with something else. Yes, a better set will undoubtably cost quite a bit more, but sometimes you really do get exactly what you pay for."
88,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Go Hearing's Ultra OTC Hearing Aids Are Quite Good,"I received a pair of Go Hearing - Go Ultra OTC Hearing Aids to use, test and review with the review to be posted on Best Buy's website.

As I am very hard of hearing and also have tinnitus, I was very interested in Go Hearing's latest product as, to date, I have not found the perfect pair of hearing aids for my hearing condition and have not been fully satisfied with any of them I've tried before. 

The grey-colored Go Hearing Ultra OTC Hearing Aids arrived nicely boxed, with a rechargeable case for the hearing aids to nest in. The case acts as a charging station so no batteries are needed. These hearing aids are designed for use not, only to hear better, but also allow Buetooth connecction with smarphones allowing listening to digital music, podcasts and acceptance of phones calls while wearing. The Go Hearing Ultra are considerably less expensive than most prescription hearing aids with more features than many.

The Go Hearing Ultra Hearing Aids are grey in color and sit behind each ear making them somewhat inconspicuous. The fit via clear plastic tubing into your ear canal and come packaged with a number of different size in-ear buds to allow the user to find the perfect fit for their ears. Volume controls and a button to accept phone calls is positioned on the behind-ear hearing aid units making it easy and convenient to control the use of the hearing aids.

I only have one issue with the Go Hearing Ultra hearing aids - the inability to adjust the sound quality - treble, medium and bass. Other than that these are very good hearing aid units for the price!"
88,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Work Well and Easy to Use,"Reading through the included manual it does not tell me to install an app.  WooHoo!  A product that doesn’t need an app to work.  I plugged them in to charge.  Turns out they are shipped with a bit of paper covering the contacts!  So be sure to remove the paper from the contacts on each earpiece before charging!  Being used to an earbud style for any type of device in my ear, I was a bit nervous about putting the earpiece into my ear.  The directions said to hold your ear and pull it straight with your other hand to help insert the earpiece.  That technique worked great.  Once they are in your ears you don’t realize they are there.  I know they work because I only have to turn the television to one third the volume I do when I’m not wearing them.  Connecting to my phone was easy.  In the Bluetooth area the “Go Ultra” device simply showed up.  (The hearing aids were on and in my ears when I did this).  When making a phone call the Go Ultra device shows up on the phone just like “Speaker” so you can choose to use them for the phone call or not.  All in all, they work well and are easy to use.  The charging case charges even when it’s not plugged in (if the case has been charged) which is great for travel.  One item that takes a bit of getting used to is the retention wire that is used to help remove the dome from the ear.  If it sticks out too far, like it did when I first tried the hearing aids, then you need to insert the dome  into the ear.  Remember they are not earbuds!  I called customer service to inquire about the retention wire because it was sticking out past my ear.  I didn’t believe the recording when it said the wait time was 9 seconds.  The call was answered by a real person in about 3 seconds.  (Yes, I timed them).   Amazing in this day and age!"
88,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Nice to hear again!!,"I like my Go Ultra OTC hearing aids! I can hear better. Still adjusting to all the different things I can hear that I couldn't before. They have blutooth! That's nice! I can watch videos or listen to music without bothering anyone with loud volume. The only thing I don't like is while blutooth is active I can still hear everything else. It's not what I thought. It's not really a bad thing. Just threw me off at first. If you know you don't hear well, I recommend them!!"

Go Hearing - Go Ultra OTC Hearing Aids - Gray

This is the third Over The Counter hearing aid I’ve tried and I have to say, so far, my favorite. They are designed for mild to moderate hearing loss and, as such, check all the boxes for someone like me. First, they are very comfortable to wear (although they take a little getting used to - more on that later). They are extremely lightweight and the clear ear tube coupled with the small in-the-ear portion, make them practically invisible. Second, the electronics containing the microphone and controls sits comfortably behind your ear, out of sight. Third, and I was initially surprised by this, they do not come with an app or a require an analysis of your hearing patterns. Finally, they are rechargeable - lasting as long as 20 hours when not using the Bluetooth feature. 

I guess the Bluetooth feature is my personal favorite! This kind of connectivity really changes the game for any hearing aids. I can take and make phone calls directly through the hearing aids, which is far superior to trying to amplify a phone call through traditional aids. I can even listen to music or other streaming services, like TV.

As mentioned, most OTC hearing aids come with an app and require you to perform a hearing analysis in order to use them. The Go Ultra aids opt for a simpler approach, although it may not be ideal for everyone. They allow 10 volume settings for each ear coupled with four different “hearing profiles” that can be set on each aid. The profiles are: normal, high-frequency loss, low-frequency loss, and general amplification. If you know what kind of loss you have (general, high, or low) you can select that setting for each ear - and they don’t have to be the same. I tried the fourth setting - general amplification - and found it was similar to the normal setting with a little boost to all frequencies. It’s easy to try the different settings at various volumes to find your preferences for each ear. Once you select a setting and volume level for each aid, they remember them the next time you put them on.

Ah, putting them on… I mentioned they are light and easy to wear for extended periods. They also take a little practice to put on. The electronics easily clip over the back of you ear and the in-ear portion is also easy to insert and comes with different sized silicone tips in two varieties. The stickler for me was the small silicone “retention wire” that sticks straight out. You need to curl this and flip it into your ear to hold them in place. I make it sound difficult and initially, it is, but with a little practice I’ve gotten better and faster at it. My concern is with people with mobility issues - such as arthritis - I think the retention wire would be problematic for such users. Along these lines, I was disappointed to see the user manual reduced to a size that would fit in the box, with no regard for the extremely small print that results. I would recommend anyone who has trouble reading fine print view the user guide on the gohearing.com website - under support. 

But overall, these aids have more to recommend them than any I’ve tried. Being rechargeable means not having to change nasty, tiny batteries. Bluetooth, in my mind is essential if you want to use modern cell phones, and the price point is very nice. If you’re considering OTC hearing aids, start with these. They also have a 45 day, full refund return policy if you find they’re not for you. But I’m keeping mine - just saying…"
88,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Most Comfortable Hearing Aid I’ve Worn,"The Go Ultra Hearing Aids are the most comfortable hearing aids I’ve ever worn.  From the first time I put them in They were/are so soft inside my ears and never felt like they were going to fall out or were too tight. The part that goes behind my ears were not too tight even though I wear glasses. Yet they were not loose enough to move around. They really are very comfortable and seem to fit the shape of my ear perfectly.  I have shoulder length white hair and the hearing aids still are not easily seen. 

This is my first rechargeable hear aids and I love that I don’t need to carry extra batteries in my purse.  They stay charged all day even when turned up to higher levels.  They came with everything I needed to charge them.  They easily charge right inside the case. The case has lights that turn colors so I know if they are charging and when they are charged. 

I had and still do have some problems with background noise that I simply can’t get to go away even when changing from open to closed domes. I experimented with the domes in an attempt to find my perfect fit and hearing level.  The noise is always slightly there. I’m hoping after wearing them a few more weeks I can figure out how to eliminate it. I’ve learned from other hearing aid brands that there is a learning curve with each new pair. I’m still adjusting to the perfect way to tap the control buttons. 

Although these hearing aids are able to sync with my phone to accept calls I find the sound is not as clear as it is without my hearing aids but I do want to learn to use this feature.  It is one of the reasons I wanted these particular hearing aids. There are bottoms on the lower part of the hearing aid to tap when answering the phone. My glasses seem to interfere a bit with the smoothness of using these buttons. I am getting better though. Again there is a learning curve and I am adjusting to use if them."
88,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,"Affordable, good sound quality, no app","Go Ultra Hearing Aids are a very nice alternative to other more costly, more complex OTC self-fitting hearing aids on the market. The offer a good sound quality and extremely easy setup, with a simple pairing to your phone or preferred Bluetooth capable device to stream audio to them. The best part of this is not having to choose between wearing your hearing aids or wearing earbuds/headphones. Something that I absolutely love about these, is that they fit perfectly comfortably in my ears while running! I've tried so many other options to get clear hearing and be able to listen to music while running. This is a huge advantage over some of the more expensive devices out there that are only now starting to open up the ability to stream calls through the required Bluetooth connection. The only real negative is that the charging case is huge! It's like carrying an early 2000s camera phone in your pocket, but it does offer a good battery life and the battery life of the hearing aids is great. Listening to quiet music and general hearing aid use while at work I can get a full workday of battery.

All in all, these are a great option for someone looking for something simple, easy to use, and has great battery but is not worried about the size of the case or the lack of a companion app. These do work great, and I would still recommend them. The case size is the only thing that takes them down the 4/5 stars."
88,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,"Not my first hearing aids, an evolutionary tale","I started wearing hearing aids about 25 years ago. The real game changer for me was the arrival on the market of Made for iPhone (MFI) hearing aids. The ability to answer phone calls, and hear it clear and crisp in BOTH ears simultaneously was quite a game changer. Additionally, it was a wireless receiver for streaming music to my hearing aids, much like the eventual development of wireless ear buds. Further advancements have continued, notably Lithium ion rechargeable devices, so fiddling with the tiny zinc air batteries once a week to toss the spent ones becomes not only more convenient but a cost savings, spending $100 a year on batteries. 
So coincident with the advances in wireless, digital, Bluetooth, rechargeable amplification came the political will to open up the market to consumer purchase of such devices without regulations on the sale of such devices. 
As a consumer of such products over the past decades, I was pleased to have the opportunity to “test drive” just such a pair courtesy of BestBuy. I was provided a pair of OTC (over the counter, that is not requiring a prescription before purchase) hearing aids for my assessment and opinion.
The Go Hearing company is not one I have previously known about, but I was impressed with the fit and finish of their product. Many of the advances that I outlined above were nicely incorporated in the hearing aids. Notably, rechargeable, compact and lightweight, binaural (that is, “stereo”). 
Whereas getting “medical grade” hearing aids requires an audiogram, where you sit in a sound proof booth, with over the ear headphones on, and are given tones at different frequencies and increasing volume. With this process, previously required to be able to purchase hearing aids, you had a graph of where your deficits were located over the entire sound wavelength spectrum. My hearing loss was greatest at the higher frequencies, not so much in the bass end, which is a very common pattern. 
No such audiogram is required to dispense an OTC pair of hearing aids, which merely amplify the entire spectrum, and the only customization is just “turning up the volume”. The medical grade hearing aids that I have actually split up the audible spectrum into about a dozen segments across what the human ear can perceive. But with digital hearing aids, custom programmed, you get a hearing spectrum corrected for amplification in the areas of the spectrum where you have the deficit. This customization is not offered with the Go Ultra device, understandably given the price point being 10% of what “prescription” hearing aids can cost. 
The OTC hearing aids are specifically indicated for those with “mild to moderate hearing loss”. As such they can make a major difference in people who just need a bit of help, where non-customized amplification can make a big difference. The situations are easy to forecast: at a movie theatre or a school play or orchestra performance, during a church service, in a restaurant with lots of background noise to hear the conversation of those at your own table, watching television so you can turn up the volume for yourself without blasting out everyone else in the room, etc. 
The Go Hearing devices are a common “behind the ear” device, where the amplifier is in the main body, and the sound is passed down a thin hollow tube into the ear canal where a soft, flexible silicone dome sits close to the eardrum. They provide three different sizes of this curved tubing, to fit best the distance from the top of the ear (where the device sits) around the curve into the canal. Those with a bigger head, for example, need a longer tube. From there there are three different sizes of dome, that fit into the canal, to accommodate differences in the diameter of the ear canal. And finally there are two choices in the dome: whether it is solid, or has venting perforations in the silicone rubber. The solid is more effective in delivering the applied sound, but the vented will be more “natural” in how the amplified tones seem to the person. So a whole lot of customization is available for personal size and preferences in an inexpensive device. 
The entire field of now available OTC hearing aids spans a wide price difference, and indeed you get what you pay for. The Go Hearing Ultra I would put in the moderate price range; you can easily find models twice the price.
Many of the technological advances are here: 
rechargeable batteries that charge while in the case from a battery inside the case. You can recharge on the go using the case, and only need to plug into a wall source periodically
Bluetooth pairing with your phone, computer, tablet, MP3 player (remember those?)
Adjustable setting for volume on the hearing aid. Able to turn on and adjust volume without having to fire up an app and navigate to the right section, which certainly could be difficult in a movie theatre or inconvenient during a restaurant meal.
Phone and online support available from the company, and probably from BestBuy Geek Squad as well
Limitations
no phone app for setting preferences or adjustments. The on/off and volume switches are pretty tiny. It takes some dexterity and learning to be able to turn them on and off and volume up and down. This could be difficult with age, arthritis, etc.
no ability to choose different listening environments. Everything is amplified the same, but they do have feedback and background noise reduction management. My experience with wind noise is that such circuitry is of some benefit, but not perfect. I found that a cover for the hearing aid cuts wind noise, and protects the hearing aid from sweat while doing outdoors strenuous activity (search for “hearing aid sweat bands”).
No streaming capacity beyond straight Bluetooth connection. Some higher priced OTC hearing aids offer MFI (“made for iPhone”) features that go beyond simple Bluetooth connection. You accept and disconnect an incoming phone call with a push of the lower button on the hearing aid. An MFI certified hearing aid will accept with a tap on your iPhone screen which automatically goes to your hearing aids. 
No customization for your particular hearing spectrum deficits. Some OTC hearing aids have an app from which you can customize for your perceived deficits. This is called “self-fit”, getting you closer to an actual audiogram based customization. The Go Hearing Ultra has 4 different programs that adjust the listening program from normal setting, to high frequency (difficulty with higher frequency, think children’s voices or noisy environment), low frequency environment (think a full orchestra concert), or across the board general amplification as in music listening. I noted that the on line web page only mentioned 3 programs, whereas the instruction booklet and my pair of hearing aids had 4 distinct programs. I confess that my perception of any difference in these was minimal, given my more profound hearing disability. 
Higher priced units offer a receiver in the canal configuration. This has the actual speaker embedded in the dome that is in the canal, only a few millimeters from the eardrum, rather than the sound traveling down a tube from the speaker that is in the body of the hearing aid behind your ear. This allows a smaller, more discrete instrument behind the ear. However, the receiver in the canal configuration is not available in even prescription higher power hearing aids, for more severe hearing loss than “moderate” loss.
Limited color selection of the device to gray, which matches my hair, but perhaps not yours.

In summary, I think the Go Hearing Ultra would be an excellent hearing aid, for the right customer. They lack the power for more severe hearing loss (like mine) and lack the ability to customize for your particular spectrum of hearing loss.  For me, they will not suffice for a back up pair of hearing aids. I had hoped that they would function for me, for example, if I had a hearing aid failure while traveling, to tide me over until I could be my primary hearing aids serviced. They don’t have enough power to do me any good; not worth even trying.
However, they will function well for my wife, who assisted me in the trial of these. She cannot wear most brands of ear buds, due to a contact allergy to many plastics. She will notice a burning and itching within the ear canal in about 15 minutes, whereas she can wear the Go Hearing ultras for a 1.5 hour TV viewing of a movie.  Her hearing deficit is much less than mine, but we can choose to have her wear the Go Ultras, and I turn on the closed captioning of the movie, and we don’t have to crank up the volume to keep us connected to the voice track. That disturbs those in an adjacent room while we are watching the TV.
It was easy to swap out the tubes and domes to customize to personalize for ear canals and head morphology. The hearing aids are comfortable to wear, so light to be imperceptible while wearing them, and discretely small enough. 
If you find that your needs exceed what these provide, then the next step would be to try a more expensive set; most OTC hearing aids offer a 30 - 45 trial period. GoHearing offers a 45 day money back guarantee, for example."
88,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Make Sure This Fits You Needs.,"Conclusion: This option is viable without getting a professional-grade hearing aid if you are looking for very discrete sound amplification. For most people, she says she doesn't hear enough hearing improvement where I needed it to justify the cost. If you have hearing loss, I'd get a hearing test and let them advise you if this range or hearing aid is for you. The design is comfortable and not noticeable. I'll continue to test them in different settings, but I can't see wearing them regularly due to the sound profile described in the cons below. For someone with more moderate hearing loss, these could provide an affordable boost until you get a tuned, professional unit. I lost almost all bass and low-frequency sounds when using these, which my spouse does not lose with a professional hearing aid.

Background for comparison:
My primary use case is to amplify conversations and reduce distracting background noise to make up for a minor loss of hearing and a harder time focusing on the voices my mother is trying to hear.
She have low to moderate hearing loss in both ears and additional problems with fluid from allergies. I've used hearing protection and amplification devices ranging from $50 in-ear amplification to $150 other name brand electronic ear protection. I asked my spouse to test the unit by replacing her professional ($8,000) hearing aid to verify my observations.

Pros:
Very light, compact, and discrete.
The case charges the hearing aids without needing to be plugged in.
There are four sound settings that provide a noticeable change in the tone profile and boost.
It comes with several tubes and cones to fit your ear comfortably. It does take time to get used to them, but this is true for all hearing aids.
They have enough sound amplification to boost hearing loss.
They do an amazing job picking up nearby sounds, which is also a con below.
She found that the music and lower frequency setting (profile 3) gave her the best sound quality and hearing improvement.
It has a good sizing guide to help with a better and faster fit.

Cons:
This unit heavily favors higher-pitch sounds. It picks up nearby sounds surprisingly well, such as rustling, scratching, sliding, and similar background noises.
I was not able to balance the volume to boost voices in the room and the TV without localized background noises being too loud and overwhelming.
The boost of higher-pitch sounds was significant, but I lost almost all lower frequencies. If I took one unit out, I could hear a much wider range of sound.
The boost of background and close proximity moise was very distracting. Even pitching up a remote was loud and blocked out other sounds.
There is no app to control the sound profile or adapt to different locations.
From the description, I was expecting much better noise cancellation. Instead, it seemed to boost background noise. The noise cancellation on her ""Other Name Brand"" earbuds price wise and are significantly better.
The storage box is big and poorly designed. The charging cord plugs into the bottom, meaning you have to turn the box on its side to charge. I can't understand this mistake.
You get a variety of tubes and cones, but not for replacement. You will need to immediately order backups for your preferred size."
88,BestBuy,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,Good but not for the price,"Over the counter hearing aids are becoming more prominent by day, and its accessibility without a prescription is great! But still, it's recommended that prior to using you get your ears checked to see what intensity level/range of hearing aids are best for you.

Aesthetically these have a more traditional look where while you're wearing them you know that they're hearing aids, and there's nothing wrong with that. I use my grandmother as the tester for hearing aids to see what's the best fit for her and works best. These work fine but no matter what settings I adjust to, it seems that my grandmother still has some hard of hearing and would just prefer not to use these to begin with, which is unfortunate.

That doesn't mean these don't work, it just means it's not right for her. These last quite awhile but a few hours short of 20 hours from our experience. It's great that you can also preselect hearing profiles, similar to preselect profiles for the type of audio experience you want (for a movie, music, etc).

I do wish that the accessories kit came with it for maintenance for the price that this costs, but it's alright. There's nothing wrong with this product, it just doesn't bring the equivalent value for what you pay for it."
88,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Packed with features,"As some one who has had many different hearing aid devices this product hits all the notes. For me I want a product that fits comfortably, delivers on my ability to hear those hard noises in scenarios while also being able to not damage what little hearing I have left.

First, upon opening the box I was greeted with a directional book that was deeply detailed. Its detail was to the point I wasn’t lost on how to set up or connect. They first step was to use the included ear measuring tool, which was very simple and took all of 10seconds. 

Inside the box it had all types of sized tubes and inserts that will fit any ear. I was a size 2 which was standard and already on the device. Once on my ear a simple button press and boom I could instantly hear better. It has four modes to help hear low and high sounds and One to amplify everything. 

For me I messed around till I found which one I liked best and then adjusted the volume button to tweak it even further. Now you can connect Bluetooth to these for music etc which was really convenient, but I found variations in sounds up and down were very dramatic so was hard for me to dial in just right.

Over all I enjoy these at home and now I have no excuse form my wife for not hearing her anymore. Highly recommend for an over the counter solution that has a lot of features."
88,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,"Comfortable, useful and of great value.","The Go Hearing Go Ultra OTC Hearing Aids are a great hearing improvement right away 

I have a slight hearing loss so these are great to have to help everything sound much better.  

They come nicely packaged and they are easy to setup and maintain. They come with a good manual with illustrations as well as a card with a phone number and email in case I need help. 
There are several things to like about them.  They are small and light so they do not stand out getting attention.  They are rechargeable with a good battery life so there is no need to look for batteries and try to exchange them.  The case charges the aids directly so using the USB C cable connects to the case and in return the case charges the aids.   Bluetooth streaming, I can hear music directly to the aids without the need for additional headphones or bothering other people with loud music.  I can answer phone calls as well directly from the hearing aids.  I also like that it does have four preset programs so I can choose what works for me.  The memory recall is also a plus, the aids remember the last way it was used so I do not need to keep changing or adjusting the aids every time after recharging them. 

I also like that they come with different domes, cleaning wires and brush to make them fit well and keeping them clean.  

They are comfortable and of good value, they also help a lot but these are not for everyone so I think trying them is a great idea especially for people trying to improve hearing."
88,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Easy to use and comfortable,"I bought these for my mother, because we didn't want to spend thousands knowing that she might lose them. She is almost 94 and has dementia. They stay in her ears so much better than the last pair we bought. They are simple and easy to use. No app but you can use them with bluetooth which is a real plus. She is very happy with them. Which is great!"

The Oura Ring requires a measurement step before you get your actual Oura Ring.  In the box, you’ll find a set of several sized plastic rings from 6-13.  After you decide which ring fits you best, you go to a provided link, fill out your information, and a ring is mailed to you.

--- FEATURES ---
Bluetooth connection to enjoy audio streaming from your phone, 4 preset programs, rechargeability with up to 20 hours of battery life, a rechargeable case, and memory recall to remember your last used settings.  

--- PERFORMANCE AND EXPECTATIONS ---
I’ve had a chance to test multiple over-the-counter hearing aids.  These are, so far, the most comfortable to wear.  They also are the ones that look most like hearing aids, compared to others that look like headbuds.  However, in my time using them, not many people noticed I had hearing aids unless I was up close, like while dancing.  

After reading the manual, it was easy to understand the different colors in the case, how to properly measure your ear for the best fit, and how to put on the hearing aids.  The manual didn’t mention an app, but instead, you determine how much volume you need in each hearing aid independently.  I set up my right side to be higher while my left side was at a low volume.  I opted for the earbuds that allowed my own voice to sound most natural, which are with an opened dome.

The hearing itself isn’t as clearly defined for me.  Noises that are not voices are over-amplified and sound way too loud.  I couldn’t find a proper balance that worked for me.  When those mixed in with voices, the ambient sounds would compete with the voices trying to talk to me and everything was obfuscated.  

When using the hearing aids during phone calls, the caller seemed to have low volume.  I adjusted the volume on the phone but that only helped marginally.  If I took off the caller from bluetooth and just used my phone’s speaker, that was louder and clearer than what I was hearing from the hearing aid.  

One thing that could also improve from the hearing aid is that there should be a light indicator that the hearing aids have turned on.  While not wearing them, it was hard to tell if I had successfully turned on or off the hearing aid.  

--- APPROVAL ---
Though these are the most comfortable hearing aids for extended use and have the best fit from any that I have tried, they didn’t work as clear as I expected them to and lack some basic features, such as a light on/off indicator.  The lack of app support and customization prevent these OTC hearing aids from a recommendation from me."
88,BestBuy,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,Reasonable performance lightweight Bluetooth !,"First impressions and use - 

These are well packed and nicely arranged. I opened the box, charged them up and gave them a try the next day. Overall
These provide a nice boost to human vocal ranges. They are especially sensitive to close sounds and feature a form of 
noise cancellation. 

Physical Operation - Turn on, adjust preset. dialing through the presets allows for different profiles of boost 
and environmental sound. These do not rely on a tunable app.  


Bike / Car / Outdoor use - Strike 1 - These seem to strangely amplify a lot of Background noise I would not notice
normally and also carry way too much environmental sound through. A plane flies over ? LOUD. Wind ? LOUD. The slight
creak from a crank-arm on my bike ? LOUD. Smacking a leafy tree branch produces a sound like crushing wads of crinkly
paper directly inside my brain. Overall - 

Movie Theater - Strike 2 - 
I like to call this my ultimate torture test. Torture it was - I had to remove these almost
immediately. There was no preset I could use in a movie that was comfortable or that worked reasonably well at all.
I tried to replicate at home with a loud audio system and had some success however these could not deal will with the
varying levels produced by the latest Harrison Ford action film. :)

Noisy restaurant - A Swing and a hit ! - Okay - much better performance than the last two tests. Other people's 
conversations faded away and those speaking at my table were easily discernable. I messed around with the preset
modes and found one that suited the scenario. I was able to hear clearly most of the time. 

Casual use - Home and Office environment. These excel where there is not a ton of background noise and boost speech
appropriately for me.

Battery performance - All day use if not streaming music or calls. Notably a Bluetooth connection is often reported
to cut them down to 7-8 hours ( even if nothing is streamed or active ). I found this caused them to run for around
nine hours with no bluetooth use. I'd recommend disconnecting them from your device when bluetooth is not needed.


A little about my own hearing loss -  I am writing this review as I have severe hearing damage in one ear due
to repeatedly rupturing an eardrum. My own hearing loss makes it difficult to discern speech on that side.
It also interferes with hearing speech, television, movies etc.....""Correctly"". Since I can still hear reasonably
well in the second ear ( Nobody's perfect, right? ) it allows for a good comparison for various hearing 
products. Notably I wear a single customized hearing aid for daily use which I removed when trying this product
in various situations. Every OTC product I have used to date requires you wear both hearing aids - so I wear
both. 


What I love:
Easy to charge and use.
EPIC battery life when Bluetooth is not used ! (can be used for a full day)
Discreet size, lightweight.

Room for improvement: 
Mediocre performance compared to higher end units 
Smaller case please !"

117,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Love them!,"This is my second style of OTC hearing aids I have tried and I have quickly noticed some positive differences. The other set I have is more of a ""ear bud"" style which I did originally like because they looked like regular wireless ear buds and they were pretty small. However, battery life wasn't ideal for all day usage with those more of just a pop them in when there is a reason to hear better kind of set-up. Originally I was hesitant for this style thinking that they would be a little unsightly for my age bracket (sub 40 years old). While I probably wont be gaining any style points at the club these are barely noticeable and substantially more comfortable to use over the entire day. Having the wire go from the ear piece to the body behind the lobe provides good weight distribution and better comfort. I had no issues using the medium size ear insert that comes pre-installed but they do also include a small and large set for other ear shapes. These offer much better battery life than the ear bud style, I would imagine also being contributed to the design to allow more space for a larger battery. The charging case is pretty large and bulky, but it does use USB-C thankfully, they do also include USB-C cord as well. This is a huge necessity for me especially since I'm on the go a lot. I am able to get 12+ hours of use in on a single charge. Sound quality has been good, not very harsh in the way it amplifies and makes it easy to focus on voices and not flood you with background noise. Overall I have been very happy with these as finding something that fits well is extremely important for how good they will function. Sennheiser is a brand I have been familiar with and trust for quality, so far these hearing aids haven't disappointed yet. All in all I definitely recommend these hearing aids!"
117,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Clear sound and comfortable fit,Sennheiser all day clear over the counter hearing aids has great clarity for the price range. The quality and the packaging of the hearing aids are substantial. The instructions are not complicated and the all day clear app for the phone is easy to use and works well for personal customization. You can use the hearing aids itself to control the volume and connect to other devices. The all day clear hearing aids are comfortable to wear all day. I feel more confident because I feel like I am apart of conversations and not alienated in life. The battery life is good but you will need to recharge if you are wearing them all day.
117,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Clarity got me sold on these hearing aids,The Clarity on this hearing aid is impressive. I must admit these hearing aids are very lightweight and I dropped them one so I know they're durable. If you want the ultimate package in a hearing aid this is your option. You will hear better feel better and it just right for any individual out there that needs to wear them.
117,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Great for Mild to Moderate Hearing Loss,"Since I've only had these for about a month, I won't go into the reliability aspect.  Also, these are my first hearing aid, so I wouldn't be able to compare with a different ones.  However I can share my my decision to buy these over others.  

Important feature I wanted was that it was rechargeable and configurable.  I narrowed down to two units, Sennheiser and Jabra.  The Jabra may have more flexibility , but I may not need all the extra.  Jabra may have longer battery life, but you really have to compare them in actual use.  

I bought mine on sale, so they were less than the Jabra 50R.  Otherwise, they usually go for more.

There are plenty of less expensive units, but many require battery change/purchase every so often.  I really didn't want that hassle.  Those units may last longer, though, since units with rechargeable batteries don't last very long.  Many of us know that from cellphone experiences, right?  Once the rechargeable batteries stop holding charge, the units become useless and need to purchase a new set.  I'm able to get two work days worth of usage on one charge and not used out side of work.

Regarding the configurability, it has individual volume settings and primitive three-band eq. (using the app)  That is actually good enough for my needs.  I have mine set at mid volume on both and boost the mid and highs at zero, or one click up.  Low is set to one or two down clicks.  Without the app, you can only change the volume together.  No EQ (not 100% sure).  

It has some other features (like phone calls), but I'm not all that interested in them and haven't tried them.

Ultimately, they seems to be doing what they're meant to do.  I can understand what people are saying now.  I wouldn't say it's ""night and day,"" though.  To me, the difference is subtle.  Results may differ from person to person.

My hearing loss is mild to moderate.  These may not work for moderate to severe hearing loss."

117,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,A Game-Changer for Dad's Hearing!,"I got my 72-year-old dad the Sennheiser hearing aid, and oh boy, it's a total game-changer! Dad's been dealing with some hearing trouble for a while, but this device has turned things around big time.

Being far away from him, I sent the aid his way, and he managed to set it up all by himself using YouTube. Easy peasy! Now, he's raving about how it's like night and day. In group chats, he used to miss out on voices, but not anymore. He's hearing everyone loud and clear, even when Mom calls him from another room.

And let's talk about phone calls—total transformation! No more struggles during family calls or chatting with the grandkids. He catches every word crystal clear. Plus, he's rocking two phones, and guess what? The Sennheiser aid plays nice with both of them. Super convenient!

The best part? He can now answer all his calls hassle-free. The headset is sleek and subtle, so he's not shouting to the world about his hearing aid. Dad's thrilled, and I bet this review will help someone else make a smart decision. Sennheiser, you nailed it!"

In conclusion, the Sennheiser All Day Clear Slim is a highly recommended product for people with hearing problems, offering both exceptional sound quality and comfort."
117,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,These hearing aid are fantastic,"I researched many brands of hearing aids before deciding to try these Sennheiser All-Day Clear.  I decided on Sennheiser because they are owned by Sonova who also owns Phonak (a well know hearing aide brand).  The day I received the hearing aids, I first charged them for about 2 hours.  They came with a slight charge, so it didn’t take long before they were ready to try.  I downloaded the All-Day Clear app and followed the easy prompts to configure them.  The hearing aids come with 3 sizes of rubber tips and the medium size is pre-installed.  I used the small size which fit perfectly in my ears.  They also come with  replacement wax guards to help keep wax from clogging and affecting the hearing aids.  At first, it took a few tries of putting on the hearing aids to get a good seal inside my ear. 
The app: the app walks you through each step: connecting them through Bluetooth, setting the volume for both left and right ears, and frequency adjustments.  It took about 20 minutes to fully set-up.  Once configured, you can adjust the volume of each individual hearing aid or both together.  You can also turn on or off the wind noise reduction setting and change the sound mode selection.  It took a few days to get used to how well the hearing aids work, and I would make small adjustments within the app to change the volume depending on the ambient noise around me.
The hearing aids: These hearing aids are very small and discreet.  I will reemphasis, very small.  So small that I’ve had multiple people notice I’m able to hear them much better and clearer, they’ve asked me if I was wearing hearing aids because they couldn’t see any.  They are very light weight also.  Once I figured out the proper way to insert the earpiece in my ear canal, I forget I’m wearing them.  These take about 4 hours to fully charge when the battery is depleted but last all day.  I have not had to remove and charge them during the day.  The Bluetooth feature has worked flawlessly with my iPhone.  I can clearly hear the person on the other end and they can clearly hear me.  It’s very convenient to make and receive calls without having to hold my phone to my ear or use the speaker phone.
The charging case:  The charging case is much larger than necessary.  One good thing about the size, it’s hard to misplace it.  The hearing aids come pre-installed in each charging port but not fully charged.  To charge, simply plug the case into the included USB cable and wall wart and place the hearing aids in each charging port.  You can charge them with the lid open or closed.  I usually charge them with the lid open so I can see the charge status.  The case does not have an exterior charge status.  The hearing aids will show charge status through a light on each one.  Once charged, the hearing aids will have a solid green light on each one.  One important note, if you remove the USB cable from the case, the hearing aids will automatically power on.  You can turn them off by pressing and holding the button on each aid for 4 seconds until the light turns red.
I highly recommend these hearing aids for anyone with hearing loss.  These hearing aids are not inexpensive but thousands less than purchasing through an audiologist.  I didn’t realize how bad my hearing had become till the purchased these.  They have made a world of difference."
117,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Vast Improvement to My Hearing,"I have mild to moderate hearing loss (depending on which ear) from decades of exposure to loud noises (e.g. sport shooting, machine shops, oil rigs, loud music); in short, I have persistently abused my ears since I was in my early teens in the early 1980s.  As a result, I've lost hearing in a few sound ranges & have constatnt tinnitus.  I took the online hearing tests from several providers, but I have also had my hearing tested by audiologists in sound isolation booths.
I gave in to the pleas of my wife & children & bought a set of Sennheiser All-Day Clear (OTC).
In the week that I have worn them, I've been adjusting to sounds that I wasn't even aware existed.  There is a marked improvement in my ability to have a conversation at home or at the office, watch TV at a normal volume, & hear things in a moderate volume environment (e.g grocery store).  I had no idea how much I was missing.
It takes a few days (sometimes more) to adjust to all of the new audio sensations, so give it time.  I will be visiting an audiologist to have them professionally tuned (& extend th ewarranty by a year), which will make my new sound experiences all the better.  It is great now, but there is opportunity for even better.
Side Note:  Very little will help in a VERY loud restaurant.  I have a friend who has what she calls nuclear-powered hearing aids (prescription) & her experience is much as mine the same in that environment; you can hear better with a device, but there is much junk noise that you shouldn't expect true clarity.
I did not end up buying my devices from Best Buy, but I would have without a limited time offer for a discount (that Best Buy did not offer) from another trusted provider."
117,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Surprisingly good for an OTC HAs and for the price,"Go these ones thru #Reviewclub promotion.
Since I've been using prescription hearing aids since 2019, my objective is to locate a better option for a significantly lower cost as a backup or emergency pair, but ironically, I can use these as my primary pair as well. 
PROS: 
- The sound quality is outstanding. Including music and phone calls via Bluetooth audio streaming (for iPhone users). comparable to my ReSound (which has the same RIC style) and my Starkey ITE. Naturally, because to the dome, you won't be able to hear the bass with earphones. Additionally, the Bluetooth distance range and microphone sound quality are excellent. 
- Easy to customize in three simple steps using the app. You simply choose your preferred clarity and volume level when the app plays a conversation that is streaming to the HAs. 
- Usability of the app: very easy to use. The bass, mid, and treble can all be equalized as well as the volume. Turn on wind noise reduction as well. 
- Noise reduction; thus far, they do it automatically and operate incredibly well. 
- Battery. Surprisingly, the batteries last longer than my day. Sometimes, I forget to charge them at night, and they last until the next midday. 
PROS: Noise reduction; thus far, nothing negative has been noticed here. They do it automatically and operate incredibly well. 
Surprisingly, the batteries last longer than my day. Sometimes, I forget to charge them at night, and they last until the next midday. 

CONS
- You are not able to upload your own custom hearing profile from your audiologist. Charlotte area does not offer a nearby audiologist to pay for it. 
- Domes. 3 domes size are delivered. The best sound is the bigger dome but I got occlusion effect, so I needed to change to a smaller one to avoid occlusion effect but loosing the full benefit. 
- Sound Profiles, You can only select 2 profiles: Automatic and Live Music. It would be great having more or create new ones. 
-  Can't customize other advanced settings that are available for prescription HAs. But that's ok, I don't use this too much in my prescription ones. 
- The charger need to be connected to the power. 
- Sometimes if you are using your phone for music or videos, the phone automatically change the sound output to the HAs automatically. Odd behavior. 

Overall these OTCs are really good and at good price. I would ask for a little discounted price just because you can't upload your own hearing profile and need to pay for it going to an specific audiologist when you could do it by your own thru the app.  Otherwise I can live with these for daily use and replace my prescription ones entirely."

And let's talk about phone calls—total transformation! No more struggles during family calls or chatting with the grandkids. He catches every word crystal clear. Plus, he's rocking two phones, and guess what? The Sennheiser aid plays nice with both of them. Super convenient!

The best part? He can now answer all his calls hassle-free. The headset is sleek and subtle, so he's not shouting to the world about his hearing aid. Dad's thrilled, and I bet this review will help someone else make a smart decision. Sennheiser, you nailed it!"

117,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,These hearing aid are fantastic,"I researched many brands of hearing aids before deciding to try these Sennheiser All-Day Clear.  I decided on Sennheiser because they are owned by Sonova who also owns Phonak (a well know hearing aide brand).  The day I received the hearing aids, I first charged them for about 2 hours.  They came with a slight charge, so it didn’t take long before they were ready to try.  I downloaded the All-Day Clear app and followed the easy prompts to configure them.  The hearing aids come with 3 sizes of rubber tips and the medium size is pre-installed.  I used the small size which fit perfectly in my ears.  They also come with  replacement wax guards to help keep wax from clogging and affecting the hearing aids.  At first, it took a few tries of putting on the hearing aids to get a good seal inside my ear. 
The app: the app walks you through each step: connecting them through Bluetooth, setting the volume for both left and right ears, and frequency adjustments.  It took about 20 minutes to fully set-up.  Once configured, you can adjust the volume of each individual hearing aid or both together.  You can also turn on or off the wind noise reduction setting and change the sound mode selection.  It took a few days to get used to how well the hearing aids work, and I would make small adjustments within the app to change the volume depending on the ambient noise around me.
The hearing aids: These hearing aids are very small and discreet.  I will reemphasis, very small.  So small that I’ve had multiple people notice I’m able to hear them much better and clearer, they’ve asked me if I was wearing hearing aids because they couldn’t see any.  They are very light weight also.  Once I figured out the proper way to insert the earpiece in my ear canal, I forget I’m wearing them.  These take about 4 hours to fully charge when the battery is depleted but last all day.  I have not had to remove and charge them during the day.  The Bluetooth feature has worked flawlessly with my iPhone.  I can clearly hear the person on the other end and they can clearly hear me.  It’s very convenient to make and receive calls without having to hold my phone to my ear or use the speaker phone.
The charging case:  The charging case is much larger than necessary.  One good thing about the size, it’s hard to misplace it.  The hearing aids come pre-installed in each charging port but not fully charged.  To charge, simply plug the case into the included USB cable and wall wart and place the hearing aids in each charging port.  You can charge them with the lid open or closed.  I usually charge them with the lid open so I can see the charge status.  The case does not have an exterior charge status.  The hearing aids will show charge status through a light on each one.  Once charged, the hearing aids will have a solid green light on each one.  One important note, if you remove the USB cable from the case, the hearing aids will automatically power on.  You can turn them off by pressing and holding the button on each aid for 4 seconds until the light turns red.
I highly recommend these hearing aids for anyone with hearing loss.  These hearing aids are not inexpensive but thousands less than purchasing through an audiologist.  I didn’t realize how bad my hearing had become till the purchased these.  They have made a world of difference."
117,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Vast Improvement to My Hearing,"I have mild to moderate hearing loss (depending on which ear) from decades of exposure to loud noises (e.g. sport shooting, machine shops, oil rigs, loud music); in short, I have persistently abused my ears since I was in my early teens in the early 1980s.  As a result, I've lost hearing in a few sound ranges & have constatnt tinnitus.  I took the online hearing tests from several providers, but I have also had my hearing tested by audiologists in sound isolation booths.
I gave in to the pleas of my wife & children & bought a set of Sennheiser All-Day Clear (OTC).
In the week that I have worn them, I've been adjusting to sounds that I wasn't even aware existed.  There is a marked improvement in my ability to have a conversation at home or at the office, watch TV at a normal volume, & hear things in a moderate volume environment (e.g grocery store).  I had no idea how much I was missing.
It takes a few days (sometimes more) to adjust to all of the new audio sensations, so give it time.  I will be visiting an audiologist to have them professionally tuned (& extend th ewarranty by a year), which will make my new sound experiences all the better.  It is great now, but there is opportunity for even better.
Side Note:  Very little will help in a VERY loud restaurant.  I have a friend who has what she calls nuclear-powered hearing aids (prescription) & her experience is much as mine the same in that environment; you can hear better with a device, but there is much junk noise that you shouldn't expect true clarity.
I did not end up buying my devices from Best Buy, but I would have without a limited time offer for a discount (that Best Buy did not offer) from another trusted provider."
117,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Surprisingly good for an OTC HAs and for the price,"Go these ones thru #Reviewclub promotion.
Since I've been using prescription hearing aids since 2019, my objective is to locate a better option for a significantly lower cost as a backup or emergency pair, but ironically, I can use these as my primary pair as well. 
PROS: 
- The sound quality is outstanding. Including music and phone calls via Bluetooth audio streaming (for iPhone users). comparable to my ReSound (which has the same RIC style) and my Starkey ITE. Naturally, because to the dome, you won't be able to hear the bass with earphones. Additionally, the Bluetooth distance range and microphone sound quality are excellent. 
- Easy to customize in three simple steps using the app. You simply choose your preferred clarity and volume level when the app plays a conversation that is streaming to the HAs. 
- Usability of the app: very easy to use. The bass, mid, and treble can all be equalized as well as the volume. Turn on wind noise reduction as well. 
- Noise reduction; thus far, they do it automatically and operate incredibly well. 
- Battery. Surprisingly, the batteries last longer than my day. Sometimes, I forget to charge them at night, and they last until the next midday. 
PROS: Noise reduction; thus far, nothing negative has been noticed here. They do it automatically and operate incredibly well. 
Surprisingly, the batteries last longer than my day. Sometimes, I forget to charge them at night, and they last until the next midday. 

CONS
- You are not able to upload your own custom hearing profile from your audiologist. Charlotte area does not offer a nearby audiologist to pay for it. 
- Domes. 3 domes size are delivered. The best sound is the bigger dome but I got occlusion effect, so I needed to change to a smaller one to avoid occlusion effect but loosing the full benefit. 
- Sound Profiles, You can only select 2 profiles: Automatic and Live Music. It would be great having more or create new ones. 
-  Can't customize other advanced settings that are available for prescription HAs. But that's ok, I don't use this too much in my prescription ones. 
- The charger need to be connected to the power. 
- Sometimes if you are using your phone for music or videos, the phone automatically change the sound output to the HAs automatically. Odd behavior. 

Overall these OTCs are really good and at good price. I would ask for a little discounted price just because you can't upload your own hearing profile and need to pay for it going to an specific audiologist when you could do it by your own thru the app.  Otherwise I can live with these for daily use and replace my prescription ones entirely."
117,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Love them!,"This is my second style of OTC hearing aids I have tried and I have quickly noticed some positive differences. The other set I have is more of a ""ear bud"" style which I did originally like because they looked like regular wireless ear buds and they were pretty small. However, battery life wasn't ideal for all day usage with those more of just a pop them in when there is a reason to hear better kind of set-up. Originally I was hesitant for this style thinking that they would be a little unsightly for my age bracket (sub 40 years old). While I probably wont be gaining any style points at the club these are barely noticeable and substantially more comfortable to use over the entire day. Having the wire go from the ear piece to the body behind the lobe provides good weight distribution and better comfort. I had no issues using the medium size ear insert that comes pre-installed but they do also include a small and large set for other ear shapes. These offer much better battery life than the ear bud style, I would imagine also being contributed to the design to allow more space for a larger battery. The charging case is pretty large and bulky, but it does use USB-C thankfully, they do also include USB-C cord as well. This is a huge necessity for me especially since I'm on the go a lot. I am able to get 12+ hours of use in on a single charge. Sound quality has been good, not very harsh in the way it amplifies and makes it easy to focus on voices and not flood you with background noise. Overall I have been very happy with these as finding something that fits well is extremely important for how good they will function. Sennheiser is a brand I have been familiar with and trust for quality, so far these hearing aids haven't disappointed yet. All in all I definitely recommend these hearing aids!"
117,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Clear sound and comfortable fit,Sennheiser all day clear over the counter hearing aids has great clarity for the price range. The quality and the packaging of the hearing aids are substantial. The instructions are not complicated and the all day clear app for the phone is easy to use and works well for personal customization. You can use the hearing aids itself to control the volume and connect to other devices. The all day clear hearing aids are comfortable to wear all day. I feel more confident because I feel like I am apart of conversations and not alienated in life. The battery life is good but you will need to recharge if you are wearing them all day.
117,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Clarity got me sold on these hearing aids,The Clarity on this hearing aid is impressive. I must admit these hearing aids are very lightweight and I dropped them one so I know they're durable. If you want the ultimate package in a hearing aid this is your option. You will hear better feel better and it just right for any individual out there that needs to wear them.
117,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Great for Mild to Moderate Hearing Loss,"Since I've only had these for about a month, I won't go into the reliability aspect.  Also, these are my first hearing aid, so I wouldn't be able to compare with a different ones.  However I can share my my decision to buy these over others.  

Important feature I wanted was that it was rechargeable and configurable.  I narrowed down to two units, Sennheiser and Jabra.  The Jabra may have more flexibility , but I may not need all the extra.  Jabra may have longer battery life, but you really have to compare them in actual use.  

I bought mine on sale, so they were less than the Jabra 50R.  Otherwise, they usually go for more.

There are plenty of less expensive units, but many require battery change/purchase every so often.  I really didn't want that hassle.  Those units may last longer, though, since units with rechargeable batteries don't last very long.  Many of us know that from cellphone experiences, right?  Once the rechargeable batteries stop holding charge, the units become useless and need to purchase a new set.  I'm able to get two work days worth of usage on one charge and not used out side of work.

Regarding the configurability, it has individual volume settings and primitive three-band eq. (using the app)  That is actually good enough for my needs.  I have mine set at mid volume on both and boost the mid and highs at zero, or one click up.  Low is set to one or two down clicks.  Without the app, you can only change the volume together.  No EQ (not 100% sure).  

It has some other features (like phone calls), but I'm not all that interested in them and haven't tried them.

Ultimately, they seems to be doing what they're meant to do.  I can understand what people are saying now.  I wouldn't say it's ""night and day,"" though.  To me, the difference is subtle.  Results may differ from person to person.

My hearing loss is mild to moderate.  These may not work for moderate to severe hearing loss."

117,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Work Wonderfully,These OTC hearing aids are worth the time to write a review.  I tried 2 different Sony OTC aids before this pair and these blow the Sony brand away.   I actually think these are just as good if not better than my previous 10K Phonaks.  I read that these are made by the same company.

117,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,A Game-Changer for Dad's Hearing!,"I got my 72-year-old dad the Sennheiser hearing aid, and oh boy, it's a total game-changer! Dad's been dealing with some hearing trouble for a while, but this device has turned things around big time.

Being far away from him, I sent the aid his way, and he managed to set it up all by himself using YouTube. Easy peasy! Now, he's raving about how it's like night and day. In group chats, he used to miss out on voices, but not anymore. He's hearing everyone loud and clear, even when Mom calls him from another room.

And let's talk about phone calls—total transformation! No more struggles during family calls or chatting with the grandkids. He catches every word crystal clear. Plus, he's rocking two phones, and guess what? The Sennheiser aid plays nice with both of them. Super convenient!

The best part? He can now answer all his calls hassle-free. The headset is sleek and subtle, so he's not shouting to the world about his hearing aid. Dad's thrilled, and I bet this review will help someone else make a smart decision. Sennheiser, you nailed it!"

In conclusion, the Sennheiser All Day Clear Slim is a highly recommended product for people with hearing problems, offering both exceptional sound quality and comfort."
117,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,These hearing aid are fantastic,"I researched many brands of hearing aids before deciding to try these Sennheiser All-Day Clear.  I decided on Sennheiser because they are owned by Sonova who also owns Phonak (a well know hearing aide brand).  The day I received the hearing aids, I first charged them for about 2 hours.  They came with a slight charge, so it didn’t take long before they were ready to try.  I downloaded the All-Day Clear app and followed the easy prompts to configure them.  The hearing aids come with 3 sizes of rubber tips and the medium size is pre-installed.  I used the small size which fit perfectly in my ears.  They also come with  replacement wax guards to help keep wax from clogging and affecting the hearing aids.  At first, it took a few tries of putting on the hearing aids to get a good seal inside my ear. 
The app: the app walks you through each step: connecting them through Bluetooth, setting the volume for both left and right ears, and frequency adjustments.  It took about 20 minutes to fully set-up.  Once configured, you can adjust the volume of each individual hearing aid or both together.  You can also turn on or off the wind noise reduction setting and change the sound mode selection.  It took a few days to get used to how well the hearing aids work, and I would make small adjustments within the app to change the volume depending on the ambient noise around me.
The hearing aids: These hearing aids are very small and discreet.  I will reemphasis, very small.  So small that I’ve had multiple people notice I’m able to hear them much better and clearer, they’ve asked me if I was wearing hearing aids because they couldn’t see any.  They are very light weight also.  Once I figured out the proper way to insert the earpiece in my ear canal, I forget I’m wearing them.  These take about 4 hours to fully charge when the battery is depleted but last all day.  I have not had to remove and charge them during the day.  The Bluetooth feature has worked flawlessly with my iPhone.  I can clearly hear the person on the other end and they can clearly hear me.  It’s very convenient to make and receive calls without having to hold my phone to my ear or use the speaker phone.
The charging case:  The charging case is much larger than necessary.  One good thing about the size, it’s hard to misplace it.  The hearing aids come pre-installed in each charging port but not fully charged.  To charge, simply plug the case into the included USB cable and wall wart and place the hearing aids in each charging port.  You can charge them with the lid open or closed.  I usually charge them with the lid open so I can see the charge status.  The case does not have an exterior charge status.  The hearing aids will show charge status through a light on each one.  Once charged, the hearing aids will have a solid green light on each one.  One important note, if you remove the USB cable from the case, the hearing aids will automatically power on.  You can turn them off by pressing and holding the button on each aid for 4 seconds until the light turns red.
I highly recommend these hearing aids for anyone with hearing loss.  These hearing aids are not inexpensive but thousands less than purchasing through an audiologist.  I didn’t realize how bad my hearing had become till the purchased these.  They have made a world of difference."

- You are not able to upload your own custom hearing profile from your audiologist. Charlotte area does not offer a nearby audiologist to pay for it.

Overall these OTCs are really good and at good price.

117,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Love them!,"This is my second style of OTC hearing aids I have tried and I have quickly noticed some positive differences. The other set I have is more of a ""ear bud"" style which I did originally like because they looked like regular wireless ear buds and they were pretty small. However, battery life wasn't ideal for all day usage with those more of just a pop them in when there is a reason to hear better kind of set-up. Originally I was hesitant for this style thinking that they would be a little unsightly for my age bracket (sub 40 years old). While I probably wont be gaining any style points at the club these are barely noticeable and substantially more comfortable to use over the entire day. Having the wire go from the ear piece to the body behind the lobe provides good weight distribution and better comfort. I had no issues using the medium size ear insert that comes pre-installed but they do also include a small and large set for other ear shapes. These offer much better battery life than the ear bud style, I would imagine also being contributed to the design to allow more space for a larger battery.

Overall I have been very happy with these as finding something that fits well is extremely important for how good they will function. Sennheiser is a brand I have been familiar with and trust for quality, so far these hearing aids haven't disappointed yet. All in all I definitely recommend these hearing aids!"
117,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Clear sound and comfortable fit,Sennheiser all day clear over the counter hearing aids has great clarity for the price range. The quality and the packaging of the hearing aids are substantial. The instructions are not complicated and the all day clear app for the phone is easy to use and works well for personal customization. You can use the hearing aids itself to control the volume and connect to other devices. The all day clear hearing aids are comfortable to wear all day. I feel more confident because I feel like I am apart of conversations and not alienated in life. The battery life is good but you will need to recharge if you are wearing them all day.
117,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Clarity got me sold on these hearing aids,The Clarity on this hearing aid is impressive. I must admit these hearing aids are very lightweight and I dropped them one so I know they're durable. If you want the ultimate package in a hearing aid this is your option. You will hear better feel better and it just right for any individual out there that needs to wear them.
117,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Great for Mild to Moderate Hearing Loss,"Since I've only had these for about a month, I won't go into the reliability aspect.  Also, these are my first hearing aid, so I wouldn't be able to compare with a different ones.  However I can share my my decision to buy these over others.  

Important feature I wanted was that it was rechargeable and configurable.  I narrowed down to two units, Sennheiser and Jabra.  The Jabra may have more flexibility , but I may not need all the extra.  Jabra may have longer battery life, but you really have to compare them in actual use.  

I bought mine on sale, so they were less than the Jabra 50R.  Otherwise, they usually go for more.

There are plenty of less expensive units, but many require battery change/purchase every so often.  I really didn't want that hassle.  Those units may last longer, though, since units with rechargeable batteries don't last very long.  Many of us know that from cellphone experiences, right?  Once the rechargeable batteries stop holding charge, the units become useless and need to purchase a new set.  I'm able to get two work days worth of usage on one charge and not used out side of work.

Regarding the configurability, it has individual volume settings and primitive three-band eq. (using the app)  That is actually good enough for my needs.  I have mine set at mid volume on both and boost the mid and highs at zero, or one click up.  Low is set to one or two down clicks.  Without the app, you can only change the volume together.  No EQ (not 100% sure).  

It has some other features (like phone calls), but I'm not all that interested in them and haven't tried them.

Ultimately, they seems to be doing what they're meant to do.  I can understand what people are saying now.  I wouldn't say it's ""night and day,"" though.  To me, the difference is subtle.  Results may differ from person to person.

My hearing loss is mild to moderate.  These may not work for moderate to severe hearing loss."

Important feature I wanted was that it was rechargeable and configurable.  I narrowed down to two units, Sennheiser and Jabra.  The Jabra may have more flexibility , but I may not need all the extra.  Jabra may have longer battery life, but you really have to compare them in actual use.  

I bought mine on sale, so they were less than the Jabra 50R.  Otherwise, they usually go for more.

There are plenty of less expensive units, but many require battery change/purchase every so often.  I really didn't want that hassle.  Those units may last longer, though, since units with rechargeable batteries don't last very long.  Many of us know that from cellphone experiences, right?  Once the rechargeable batteries stop holding charge, the units become useless and need to purchase a new set.  I'm able to get two work days worth of usage on one charge and not used out side of work.

Regarding the configurability, it has individual volume settings and primitive three-band eq. (using the app)  That is actually good enough for my needs.  I have mine set at mid volume on both and boost the mid and highs at zero, or one click up.  Low is set to one or two down clicks.  Without the app, you can only change the volume together.  No EQ (not 100% sure).  

It has some other features (like phone calls), but I'm not all that interested in them and haven't tried them.

Ultimately, they seems to be doing what they're meant to do.  I can understand what people are saying now.  I wouldn't say it's ""night and day,"" though.  To me, the difference is subtle.  Results may differ from person to person.

My hearing loss is mild to moderate.  These may not work for moderate to severe hearing loss."

117,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,A Game-Changer for Dad's Hearing!,"I got my 72-year-old dad the Sennheiser hearing aid, and oh boy, it's a total game-changer! Dad's been dealing with some hearing trouble for a while, but this device has turned things around big time.

Being far away from him, I sent the aid his way, and he managed to set it up all by himself using YouTube. Easy peasy! Now, he's raving about how it's like night and day. In group chats, he used to miss out on voices, but not anymore. He's hearing everyone loud and clear, even when Mom calls him from another room.

And let's talk about phone calls—total transformation! No more struggles during family calls or chatting with the grandkids. He catches every word crystal clear. Plus, he's rocking two phones, and guess what? The Sennheiser aid plays nice with both of them. Super convenient!

The best part? He can now answer all his calls hassle-free. The headset is sleek and subtle, so he's not shouting to the world about his hearing aid. Dad's thrilled, and I bet this review will help someone else make a smart decision. Sennheiser, you nailed it!"

I'm also impressed by its durability and long battery life, making it an ideal choice for everyday use. In conclusion, the Sennheiser All Day Clear Slim is a highly recommended product for people with hearing problems, offering both exceptional sound quality and comfort."
117,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,These hearing aid are fantastic,"I researched many brands of hearing aids before deciding to try these Sennheiser All-Day Clear.  I decided on Sennheiser because they are owned by Sonova who also owns Phonak (a well know hearing aide brand).  The day I received the hearing aids, I first charged them for about 2 hours.  They came with a slight charge, so it didn’t take long before they were ready to try.  I downloaded the All-Day Clear app and followed the easy prompts to configure them.  The hearing aids come with 3 sizes of rubber tips and the medium size is pre-installed.  I used the small size which fit perfectly in my ears.  They also come with  replacement wax guards to help keep wax from clogging and affecting the hearing aids.  At first, it took a few tries of putting on the hearing aids to get a good seal inside my ear. 
The app: the app walks you through each step: connecting them through Bluetooth, setting the volume for both left and right ears, and frequency adjustments.  It took about 20 minutes to fully set-up.  Once configured, you can adjust the volume of each individual hearing aid or both together.  You can also turn on or off the wind noise reduction setting and change the sound mode selection.  It took a few days to get used to how well the hearing aids work, and I would make small adjustments within the app to change the volume depending on the ambient noise around me.
The hearing aids: These hearing aids are very small and discreet.  I will reemphasis, very small.  So small that I’ve had multiple people notice I’m able to hear them much better and clearer, they’ve asked me if I was wearing hearing aids because they couldn’t see any.  They are very light weight also.  Once I figured out the proper way to insert the earpiece in my ear canal, I forget I’m wearing them.  These take about 4 hours to fully charge when the battery is depleted but last all day.  I have not had to remove and charge them during the day.  The Bluetooth feature has worked flawlessly with my iPhone.  I can clearly hear the person on the other end and they can clearly hear me.  It’s very convenient to make and receive calls without having to hold my phone to my ear or use the speaker phone.
The charging case:  The charging case is much larger than necessary.  One good thing about the size, it’s hard to misplace it.  The hearing aids come pre-installed in each charging port but not fully charged.  To charge, simply plug the case into the included USB cable and wall wart and place the hearing aids in each charging port.  You can charge them with the lid open or closed.  I usually charge them with the lid open so I can see the charge status.  The case does not have an exterior charge status.  The hearing aids will show charge status through a light on each one.  Once charged, the hearing aids will have a solid green light on each one.  One important note, if you remove the USB cable from the case, the hearing aids will automatically power on.  You can turn them off by pressing and holding the button on each aid for 4 seconds until the light turns red.
I highly recommend these hearing aids for anyone with hearing loss.  These hearing aids are not inexpensive but thousands less than purchasing through an audiologist.  I didn’t realize how bad my hearing had become till the purchased these.  They have made a world of difference."

I took the online hearing tests from several providers, but I have also had my hearing tested by audiologists in sound isolation booths.
I gave in to the pleas of my wife & children & bought a set of Sennheiser All-Day Clear (OTC).
In the week that I have worn them, I've been adjusting to sounds that I wasn't even aware existed.

PROS: 
- The sound quality is outstanding. Including music and phone calls via Bluetooth audio streaming (for iPhone users). comparable to my ReSound (which has the same RIC style) and my Starkey ITE. Naturally, because to the dome, you won't be able to hear the bass with earphones. Additionally, the Bluetooth distance range and microphone sound quality are excellent.

- Usability of the app: very easy to use. The bass, mid, and treble can all be equalized as well as the volume. Turn on wind noise reduction as well. 
- Noise reduction; thus far, they do it automatically and operate incredibly well.

CONS
- You are not able to upload your own custom hearing profile from your audiologist. Charlotte area does not offer a nearby audiologist to pay for it. 
- Domes. 3 domes size are delivered. The best sound is the bigger dome but I got occlusion effect, so I needed to change to a smaller one to avoid occlusion effect but loosing the full benefit. 
- Sound Profiles, You can only select 2 profiles: Automatic and Live Music. It would be great having more or create new ones. 
-  Can't customize other advanced settings that are available for prescription HAs. But that's ok, I don't use this too much in my prescription ones. 
- The charger need to be connected to the power. 
- Sometimes if you are using your phone for music or videos, the phone automatically change the sound output to the HAs automatically. Odd behavior. 

Overall these OTCs are really good and at good price. I would ask for a little discounted price just because you can't upload your own hearing profile and need to pay for it going to an specific audiologist when you could do it by your own thru the app.  Otherwise I can live with these for daily use and replace my prescription ones entirely."
117,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Love them!,"This is my second style of OTC hearing aids I have tried and I have quickly noticed some positive differences. The other set I have is more of a ""ear bud"" style which I did originally like because they looked like regular wireless ear buds and they were pretty small. However, battery life wasn't ideal for all day usage with those more of just a pop them in when there is a reason to hear better kind of set-up. Originally I was hesitant for this style thinking that they would be a little unsightly for my age bracket (sub 40 years old). While I probably wont be gaining any style points at the club these are barely noticeable and substantially more comfortable to use over the entire day. Having the wire go from the ear piece to the body behind the lobe provides good weight distribution and better comfort. I had no issues using the medium size ear insert that comes pre-installed but they do also include a small and large set for other ear shapes. These offer much better battery life than the ear bud style, I would imagine also being contributed to the design to allow more space for a larger battery. The charging case is pretty large and bulky, but it does use USB-C thankfully, they do also include USB-C cord as well. This is a huge necessity for me especially since I'm on the go a lot. I am able to get 12+ hours of use in on a single charge. Sound quality has been good, not very harsh in the way it amplifies and makes it easy to focus on voices and not flood you with background noise. Overall I have been very happy with these as finding something that fits well is extremely important for how good they will function. Sennheiser is a brand I have been familiar with and trust for quality, so far these hearing aids haven't disappointed yet. All in all I definitely recommend these hearing aids!"
117,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Clear sound and comfortable fit,Sennheiser all day clear over the counter hearing aids has great clarity for the price range. The quality and the packaging of the hearing aids are substantial. The instructions are not complicated and the all day clear app for the phone is easy to use and works well for personal customization. You can use the hearing aids itself to control the volume and connect to other devices. The all day clear hearing aids are comfortable to wear all day. I feel more confident because I feel like I am apart of conversations and not alienated in life. The battery life is good but you will need to recharge if you are wearing them all day.
117,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Clarity got me sold on these hearing aids,The Clarity on this hearing aid is impressive.

96,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,"Using this for its wireless mic, works great","I got this because I take horseback riding lessons, at age 73. The indoor arena is 200 feet long, so it's hard to hear the trainer at that distance. The wireless microphone that comes with this set solves the problem. 

I made a holder for the microphone from a foam airconditioner filter, to block the wind. It goes around the trainer's neck, on a string -- so her hands are free. The microphone broadcasts her voice to the earbuds, that I wear under my riding helmet. I can hear the trainer perfectly now, no matter how far away -- the range of the microphone is sufficient to broadcast the entire distance of 200 feet, which is even more than the rated distance. Maybe it helps that the walls of the arena are metal, so the radio waves can bounce off of them. 

So I definitely recommend this product with its wireless microphone for similar uses, for other sports as well. 

You do need to get a cord to retain the earbuds, to make sure one of them won't fall out and get stepped on by your horse! Such cords are readily available to retain earbuds. 

As regular hearing aids, I wouldn't say that these earbuds do a lot. They mainly amplify. There is some possibility to adjust the volume and tone. However, if you have serious hearing problems you likely need to pay more to get more customization to solve your hearing problem. I myself can hear fine when there's no background noise. But in a noisy place, not so well.  So I only use this product for my riding lessons. 

They hold a charge fine for the 1 hour of a riding lesson. At the end, usually down to 80% power. So they have plenty of power capacity. Recharging is fast.

You can buy wireless headsets made especially for sports like riding, sailing, or the like -- but they would cost more than this."
96,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Great hearing aids at an amazing price.,"Wow! I was surprised with how the great quality of these hearing aids. We purchased traditional hearing aids for my then 6 y/o daughter which cost about $5,000 and requires battery replacement every couple of days. While the Linner hearing aids might not be as advanced, I know I am now hearing sounds that I didn't used to hear in recent years. The setup with the app was super easy and fast. I really appreciated that the hearing aids utilize the built-in hearing test to adjust the tones of each side. Battery life gets me well beyond a day (I keep them on about 3-4 hours a day). Definitely a keeper.
I also let my dad and aunt try one of the buds and they asked me to buy them for them too. Seriously a great set of hearing aids that look like buds at a great value."
96,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,better than I expected,"This hearing aids have been a life-changing experience. As someone who has struggled with hearing loss, this device has made a remarkable difference in my day-to-day life. 
First and foremost, the clarity of sound that I now experience is simply outstanding. From conversations with loved ones to enjoying music and even the subtle sounds of nature, every aspect of my auditory world has been significantly enhanced. I can hear nuances and details that were previously lost to me, bringing back a sense of connection and joy. The battery is better than expected. I no longer have to worry about my hearing aids losing power unexpectedly, which gives me peace of mind throughout the day."
96,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Good product at a decent price,"Pretty happy with the purchase after several days of using. Sound quality is good, app is easy to use, and price is pretty reasonable. I’d say overall it’s a great value."
96,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Super easy to use and the best look hearing aids,"I really like the design of Linner Nova, it looks just elegant. And the UV-C light is so beautiful when it’s on. I used for TV most times and it is terrific."
96,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,good to buy,"I brought this hearing ear plug for my father, and he has been using it for two weeks, so far the barratry life is good, and the noise canceling function is working well"
96,BestBuy,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,buzzing sound,I'm having trouble with this hearing aid.. I heard a buzz and its not really cancelling the noise.. The volume when you put to high it will lower the sound but when you put to low it will put to high volume.. The buzz that i heard still continue and my ears get irritated..
96,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,LINNER Nova,I love these hearing aids. They are super comfortable. I love the app that makes it so easy to make adjustments
96,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Okay,"They make everything very loud, which is good for someone who is harder of hearing than myself. They help me understand things people are saying to me, however."
96,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Great for the price,"Grandma has $5,0000 hearing aids but 1 broke and she has been looking for a cheap replacement pair. This hearing aids are probably the best ones for $300. We also try the Hewitt Packard hearing aids when they were $700. Unfortunately, my grandma’s hearing loss is so bad that she hast to turn the volume up so loud that it causes feedback for squeaking/whining."
96,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Blue tooth headset,I use this headset every day of my life.  I now enjoy tv which I haven’t for a while.  They are perfect.  Highly recommend
96,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Change entire hearing,"Have it and been in use for 2 weeks so far, this has been greatly improved my hearings. I felt completely and in the 2 first days it might sound a little loud but very soon I got used to it. Life got way more convenient when I talk outside and watch TV. It is small and I liked the volume control bottom design allows me to be able to adjust the volume without cell phone."
96,BestBuy,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Wanted to like them...,"The good:
1.  Fit well in ears, are comfortable, and feel like they'll stay put.
2.  Easy to pair with phone and app.

The bad:
1. Sound quality is really pretty bad - sounds like you're listening through an extremely cheap microphone.  These produce nowhere near the sound quality of the very cheapest earbuds I've used.
2.  Sound volume is still too much even on the lowest-volume setting - I understand it's an ""amplification"" device, but it's like using a hammer when a tweezers would work

I'm not sure what the other reviewers were looking for, but I don't understand how anyone could be happy with these."
96,BestBuy,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,There is too much echoing,I was rally hoping that these would work as described. But after setting up the hearing aid with application. The echoes was to much for me. Felted like I was in a tunnel sounds weird with echoed background.
96,BestBuy,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,Didn't work for me - too much gackground noise!!!,"Not a bad idea, but for me it picked up way too much background noise.  Even my walking saw deafening loud.  I could not get these to work for me - one plus - they are comfortable."

Dialogue on TV shows and movies has been getting harder for both of us to understand, while my wife in particular has a very difficult time hearing me when her head is turned or when we’re trying to have a conversation in a car or from across the room, etc.  

We started seeking OTC solutions for our respective hearing conditions, beginning with some lower-cost hearing “amplifiers” which we quickly jettisoned for being little more than pretty-good-sounding earbuds that happened to offer some targeted but unnatural amplification capabilities. When we upped the ante to a set of legit OTC aids from a well-regarded competing brand (that clocked in at just around $1K, by the way), we were blown away with the difference it made. We thought maybe we had stumbled into an endgame OTC solution after just that little bit of looking, but then along came these Jabra Select Enhance 300s—and they COMPLETELY upended our thinking about how good OTC hearing aids could get...read on to learn more. 

The Jabra Enhance hearing aids come in a box that is literally jam-packed with accessories and consumables that look almost intimidating at first. Unlike a set of high-end earbuds that might come with a few sizes of ear tips, a charging case, and maybe a stubby charging cable, the Enhance Select 300s set you up for a good year or more of steady use with cleaning and wax guard replacement supplies; not three but SEVEN different types/sizes of eartips (open, closed, and flanged “tulip” domes) to accommodate varying degrees of isolation, fit, and comfort; removable sport locks to keep the aids in place during exercise/sports; as well as a charging cable and wall block charger. 

The charging case is somewhat bulky—it is portable, but not really pocketable. However, unlike the case provided with our other OTC aids, the Jabra charging case also has a battery on board that can provide three full charge cycles for the hearing aids before needing to be recharged itself. A three-segment LED gauge on the back indicates the charge level of the case while the 5-segment LED gauge under the magnetic lid indicates charge level for the hearing aids. A quick 30-minute charge juices the aids enough for 8 hours of use while 3 hours in the charging cradle will give you about 30 hours of battery life. With a fully charged set of hearing aids and a fully charged case in tow, you can theoretically get about 120 hours of use before needing to plug the case in again! 

The hearing aid assemblies themselves are tiny, much more so than we had expected. This translated into AMAZING comfort because they literally disappear behind your ear. I don’t know what kind of voodoo Jabra used to smush all that capability down into such a tiny form factor, but the end result really does feel like you’re not wearing anything at all. As an added bonus, the portion of the aids that rest behind the ear did NOT interfere with the fit or comfort of our glasses while they were in use.  

Each hearing aid has a single push button on the back—it's an actual button, not a touch-panel, so it’s easy to feel/know when you’ve pressed down on the right spot. The buttons let you control power, volume, and cycle through the 4 hearing enhancement modes. These modes are available directly in the aids, or you can select and further customize them in the companion app for your smartphone. 

Like most personal smart products these days, you’ll need to download a companion app to get your hearing aids activated, set up, and dialed in to your tastes and preferences. Within the app, the range of adjustments and ambient sound accommodation programs are impressive. There is an “all-around” setting that is kind of a generic “do-it-all"" program for hearing enhancement, a restaurant setting that is best suited to noisy social environments, a music setting (which my wife used during a recent outdoor concert to great success), and an outdoor setting that limits wind noise. Each program can be further tailored to either reduce ambient noise or enhance speech clarity, with additional customizations available for low, mid, and high frequencies. 

The app is also your starting place for customizing the hearing aids to your personal hearing needs as well as your portal to all manner of support. This includes guided videos for fitment and use, as well as a hearing test to get you started. Once the test is complete, the results of your audiogram are uploaded to Jabra where initial sound profile adjustments are made and pushed to your hearing aids. You also have the option of a virtual setup consultation with an audiologist.  

Our video consultation was extensive, and the physician clearly knew the ins and outs of the hardware and app/phone settings necessary to get us up and running. She pushed some adjustments to the hearing aids in real-time during our session to improve in-ear telephone performance, and scheduled a follow-up meeting 2 weeks later to see how things were doing and to help make additional adjustments. I even got an email from Jabra support a few days later telling me how to adjust some account information we entered online based simply on an offhand comment I made to the audiologist during the initial consult. This level of support came bundled with the Enhance Select 300s and is frankly WAY above and beyond what we would ever have expected for OTC hearing aids. If this is your first set of hearing aids and you’re not sure what to expect, or would simply like to feel more confident about your purchase, I highly recommend taking advantage of Jabra’s incredible customer support features.  

With all of that said, I suppose I should make some notes of the performance, right? In a word, FABULOUS. The Enhance Select 300s turns in an incredibly natural-sounding audio performance—there was none of the telltale watery, tinny, or artificial-sounding amplification that sometimes accompanies digital signal processing for hearing enhancement. The distracting sidetone effect (hearing your own voice echo during speech) we noted from the last set of hearing aids we tried was also thankfully missing with the Enhance Select 300s. In fact, the enhancement effects were SO natural that my wife was convinced the hearing aids weren’t working at all, until she took them out and realized just how degraded her “normal” hearing really is!  

From the other side of the equation, I was finally able to carry on a normal conversation with my wife from across the room, even at a whisper, or have her hear a question I asked while driving without me having to get her attention two or three times. And before we decided to fully devote these hearing aids to my wife, I also tried them out with the soundtracks to my typically more troublesome TV shows and movies and found that I didn’t need to turn the volume up anywhere near as high to clearly understand and enjoy the dialogue. Given our experience, I HIGHLY recommend the Enhance Select 300 for anyone with mild to moderate hearing loss where the naturalness of the resultant sound is of paramount importance. 

The only things we felt were just slightly short of outstanding were streaming media and phone performance. Audiobooks sounded just fine using the hearing aids, but music streamed from my iPhone 14 Pro Max sounded—passable; my wife reported the same sentiments using her iPhone. Similarly, talking on the phone using the hearing aids like wireless earbuds was not as ideal as we would have expected given how well the aids performed with ambient hearing enhancement—in fact, it was necessary to max the volume just to carry on a conversation, and even then, the results weren’t necessarily stellar.  

The audiologist said there were more adjustments she could try pushing to the hearing aids during the next consultation to improve performance, but until that follow-up appointment, let’s just say that phone call performance could be better. Still, those issues don’t completely detract from the primary function of these hearing aids: to improve your hearing, especially for conversations, in complex or noisy environments. And in that capacity, it’s not hyperbole to call the results we experienced were life-changing, at least in terms of the conversational life my wife and I have had trouble sharing these past few years."
184,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"This Can Be a Life-Changing Product, No Kidding","One of the hardest things in life is not being able to communicate effectively or easily. This is a common problem for those of us who are hard of hearing. Not only is it frustrating, but for some it is embarrassing, especially when you have to repeatedly say “What?” all the time. Not being able to hear can lead some people to isolation and loneliness. Many people have been forced to live like this because of the high cost of prescription hearing aids. JabraGN and their line of Enhance Select over-the-counter (OTC) hearing aids have brought down the price of admission to improved hearing considerably. OTC hearing aids are relatively new to the marketplace and are quite different from the “personal hearing amplifiers” that many people may be familiar with that come with a somewhat modest price tag. You do get what you pay for when it comes to those devices and with true hearing aid products.

Just like with vision, hearing varies from person to person, sometimes a great deal. The jabraenhance.com web site offers a simplified hearing assessment to determine if you are a candidate for OTC hearing aids as they are intended for people experiencing mild to moderate hearing loss (greater loss is usually referred to as “profound”). In my own situation, I am at the upper end of moderate loss, but have found that OTC hearing aids (HAs) work just as well as my set of prescription HAs which are now just over 5 years old and nearing the end of their anticipated life expectancy. I have been a hearing aid user for the past 12 years and am in my late sixties.

These JabraGN Enhance Select 300 hearing aids (I’m going to abbreviate as ES 300) are comparable to many prescription HAs on the market in size, technology, adaptability to your needs, and quality of both the hardware and the professional care experience. The parent company, GN Group based in Denmark, also makes prescription hearing aids under the ReSoundGN banner and has been a major player in this industry for many years and has a reputation comparable to the other big players in this arena. In fact these ES 300 HAs look virtually identical to a ReSound product and have the feel, functionality, and user-adjustability via smartphone control as many prescription HAs have.

With hearing aids, not only are you buying hardware, you are buying “professional care” delivered by both licensed audiologists (AuD), and hearing instrument specialists (HIS), and this is just as important as the hardware in my opinion. JabraGN offers their Enhance Select HAs with both a “Basic” and “Premium” package, with differing price points. The additional charge for the Premium Package gets you 3 years of warranty and loss & damage protection instead of the 1 year offered in the Basic Package, but more importantly you receive 3 years of customer service consisting of custom programming to your individual needs and access to JabraGN’s AuD and HIS staff. To me, this is a true bargain considering the price differential, especially when you consider that there will not be the need to travel to an office to access these services. Meetings with staff are held via Zoom on your phone, tablet, or computer, and any custom programming is accomplished via a download through the app on your phone or tablet. And I can’t tell you enough just how slick these services work. If you have ever had experience with older or inexpensive HAs where you had to have your hearing professional connect them with a wire to their computer to make adjustments or updates, you will be amazed at just what is available nowadays with modern technology.

JabraGN includes a wealth of accessories with the ES 300 and they allow you to tailor the fit and sound to your ears using different soft rubber domes that fit into your ear canal and are at the end of the receiver (which most people would call a “speaker”). Don’t underestimate the effect these little pieces of rubber can have on the sound quality - it isn’t only about fit and comfort when it comes to domes. They can have a noticeable effect on the sound amplification of the HAs. The kit also comes with a supply of maintenance products to clean the HAs and keep them functioning as new for a long period of time. Also included is a measuring tool to determine the proper length of the receiver wire for your particular ear shape. If the included receivers are not the proper length that you need, Jabra will send you another size of receiver at no additional charge. The one thing that I did find missing when compared to my prescription HAs is a storage container (Sta-Dri is a brand name for this product) that contains a renewable desiccant to remove moisture from the HAs or to keep them dry when not being used or charged. Another option is to purchase separately, an electrically operated dryer where you put the HAs into it and run it through a cycle that takes a couple hours to gently remove moisture from the devices. I think either option is money well spent to extend the life of your HAs.

The User Guide for the Enhance Select 300 is remarkably well written and illustrated when it comes to walking through a user who is new to hearing aids. It goes into great detail about proper fit of hearing aids, how to care for them, and gives a great general overview of the how, what, and why of hearing aid use. While detailed, the information is presented in an easy to understand way that should not be overwhelming or intimidating to a new user. That said, hearing aids and their care is not entirely foolproof and do require some manual dexterity of the fingers as everything is rather small, and the end user should also be of sound mind to properly use and care for the devices. The Jabra Enhance Select app for your smartphone and the manufacturer’s web site are also great sources of additional information and contain short videos about a variety of use and care topics.

The app for your smartphone or tablet is well designed for ease of use and provides a number of functions to allow for control of the HAs and to allow for some customization of the settings by the user such as noise filters and a speech clarifying option. There are four different program settings for differing environmental situations. And within each of these programs are additional customizations to fit your needs. The app also allows you to contact Jabra for help with any issues or questions you may have, or set up an appointment with one of their professionals for a future date. Your account information will also display details about your HA devices, and when the warranty and/or support access expires. The hearing aids will work without smartphone connectivity, and you are still able to adjust volume and change programs.

The ES 300 HAs have rechargeable batteries (that are not user replaceable), and they come with a charging case to store them in. There is a small wall charger with a 4-foot-long USB cable that connects to the charging case. The case contains a rechargeable battery inside of it and the hearing aids can be charged from the case’s battery three full times without being plugged into an electrical outlet. There are small lights on the case where the charging cord plugs in to tell you the charge status of the case battery. These lights illuminate when you remove or insert the HAs into the case for charging, or when you plug the charger into the case. There is a second set of small lights inside the case that illuminate when you remove or insert the HAs into the case and these lights indicate the charge remaining in the HA with the lowest amount of charge. The interesting thing is that you cannot get either set of lights to illuminate (to check the amount of charge) by opening the case or pressing a button - you have to remove or replace the HAs or plug in the cord. There is also a confusing statement on page 22 of the manual as it states “turned-on charger” as there is no button to turn the charger on or off.

Hearing aids that connect to a smartphone via Bluetooth have for a while now offered the ability to stream either phone call audio to the HAs or stream audio content such as music or podcasts to the HAs. In the past I had to hold my phone up to my mouth while talking on a phone call to use the microphone in the phone as the HAs did not have this two-way functionality built into them like a lot of wireless ear buds do. The ES 300 now has this ability to have a phone conversation using the mics built into the HAs and your phone can stay in your pocket or purse. I do have to admit that for me and my hearing issues, I do find that using my AirPods for phone calls and streaming audio from my iPhone makes for better sound quality than the HAs do. But having this ability is handy if I am somewhere without AirPods and I get a phone call. A tip for users is that when on a phone call or streaming audio to your ES 300s, to adjust the volume you hear, you have to use the volume buttons on the phone. When using your HAs to hear, the buttons on the HAs can be used to adjust your listening volume, but not while streaming audio from your phone or tablet. Pressing the button on the HA during a phone call will disconnect the call. Pressing the buttons on the HAs while listening to music will adjust the sensitivity of the microphones on the HA body to adjust how much you can hear sounds around you, but they will not adjust the volume of the audio material coming from your device.

I have only had my first appointment with a Jabra hearing specialist, so I still have some fine tuning to do to hopefully obtain better speech clarity in noisy environments. Better hearing is truly a life changing experience. Best Buy offers a 60-day return window for OTC hearing aids, so you really have nothing to lose in trying them for yourself. To those with hearing difficulties, please seek the help that is available. It is now easier and cheaper to do so than it ever has been."
184,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"Significant hearing improvement, fantastic support","The Jabra Enhance Select 300 OTC hearing aids are, by far, the best OTC hearing aid product and support that I've experienced to date.  

In the box are the hearing aids with receiver wires, charging case with USB-A to USB-C charging cable with wall plug, various sizes and shapes of domes, sport mode locks, and a cleaning kit. Setup takes a few steps, which are documented in step by step cards for each step in the process.  First there is a QR code to scan to activate the hearing aids. Once scanned, the website requires an activation code (located on the same card as the QR code) and the store the hearing aids were purchased at.  This will take you to a page to create your account, download the Jabra Enhance Select app, and then walks you through pairing to your mobile device via Bluetooth. Note that on Apple iOS you'll pair through the Accessibility setting using the hearing devices option.  This means you do not need the app for calls to come straight to the hearing aids. 

Once the account is created, the app will walk you through a hearing test, which will need to be completed in a quiet environment. The hearing test results are used in the app to customize the basic settings automatically. Note that it is recommended, but not required, to get an audiologist report to improve fine tuning of settings.  I did both and saw a general overlap between the audiologist test and the app results, see photos for comparison.

One significant benefit of the Jabra hearing aids is that Jabra provides a video consultation with their hearing ""Care Team"" specialists to answer questions, discuss any concerns, and provide tips on care and how to optimize performance.  This benefit is available at no cost for three years as part of the product service period and is something I recommend to take advantage of to ensure you're getting the best performance out of your hearing aids. During the consultation we discussed fit, usage, any issues I was having, and discussed my history and audiologist report.  Once I completed my consultation and uploaded my most recent audiologist report, the Care Team adjusted the hearing aid settings and sent an over the air update to fine tune based on the report. 

The app, or included instructions, walks you through which ear dome type to choose based on hearing loss and then size based on comfort and preference.  Note there are extras of each size and type, however this is something that you'll have to purchase more of as they wear out. There is also a ""sport lock"" attachment for high activity use, however I have not needed or tried these as of yet. There is only one wire size included, which works for the general population, however it is something that is reviewed during the consultation and a different size can be provided if deemed necessary.  The overall size of the hearing aid is small and lightweight and is comfortable for all day wear. If you wear glasses, the ear piece will either sit beside or on top of the hearing aid, but either way is not uncomfortable, it just depends on the thickness of the glasses ear piece.

These are my second pair of OTC hearing aids, so after two years, I'm fairly accustomed to wearing hearing aids.  If you are new to OTC hearing aids, you'll want to note that you need to ease into them.  Both getting used to having them in, as it takes some time to get used to the ear dome, as well as the changes to what you will hear.  I experienced nausea for the first week while wearing OTC hearing aids. During the consult the Care Team specialist advised this was normal due to the changes in what I'm hearing and processing.  The recommendation is to ease into wearing them, starting with a few hours a day, increasing to full time wearing over the course of two weeks.  Mileage may vary based on your own tolerance and hearing loss profile.

The other significant benefit of these hearing aids is the performance. Sound quality clarity and hearing improvement is significant for me personally.  I didn't realize how much I couldn't hear until I started using these hearing aids, even in comparison to the older pair I had prior to these.  The clarity in sound feels very natural, and once I got used to hearing that frequency range again, it now feels normal, not over amplified or digitized. A few key app features are the noise filter and the environment settings (see photos).  The all around setting offers a noise filter, speech clarity, and custom setting filter as well as an amplification setting. Other sound profiles include restaurant, music, and outdoor filters which change the sound input such as reducing wind noise when in outdoor mode.  Another point to call out is that these hearing aids are much improved from previous generations in that I can take calls and use headphones without any type of feedback or static noise.

Top reasons I love the Jabra Enhance Select hearing aids: 
1. The three year warranty and  hearing Care Team support ensure your settings and usage are optimized for the absolute best experience.
2. The quality of sound, as the inputs are far improved from the prior OTC hearing aids I was using before these.
3. The customization options in the app and compatibility with headsets and cell phones.  
4. Battery life! These hearing aids are rechargeable which means I no longer have to shop for batteries and ensure I keep batteries with me when I go out. Charging is fast, 30 minutes of charging will last approximately 8 hours, and after wearing all day I haven't gotten below 70% charge. 
5. Ease of use, even if these were my first OTC hearing aids, the app and setup guides are intuitive enough that it's easy to get started and understand what I need to do if something isn't working as expected."
184,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Affordable and Exert Adjusted Hearing for All,"THIS…. Is the Jabra Enhance Select 300 over the counter hearing aids coming touting premium accessibility and versatility in a significantly cheaper package than you would find at your doctors office. Something unique that I enjoyed before we dive into this review is that, usually you will go to your Dr. to get the earbuds tuned and adjusted, but Jabra through the ‘select’ package that comes standard with these hearing aids allows you to adjust most things on your own, and set up an appointment to have an expert dial them in from the comfort of your own home - and the best part of this process is that you can do it as often as you need to from wherever you are at making this a significantly more accessible option. I work in the healthcare field and watch people wait over a significant period of time with varying degree's of mobility and cognition, so the ability to do this from your home/facility or have a loved one expedite this process makes it almost priceless to me. That being said, this is still a decent bit of cash to spend on hearing aids, but my grandfather needed a new set to replace his aging battery-powered hearing aids, so we took the leap to see if these hearing aids are easy for the elderly to setup and operate daily - so lets see how they performed!

For setting up the hearing aids, it was so simple that my grandfather could set them up himself! Thanks to the well thought out app and numerical step by step cards provided in the box, there was no guessing on what to do as it was all well laid out. Jabra also made things color coordinated and simple to understand physically on the product where they could. Red tipped hearing aid was for the right ear, blue tipped was for the left ear, this is carried over into the charging case where there is a red indicator for the right, and blue for the left. As far as volume options, there are thirteen settings 1-13 and you turn it up and down by clicking the buttons on the left (lower) or right (higher) hearing aid…this is also the only button on either one so you can’t miss click a button. The hearing aids also come with an extensive amount of tips and cleaning items to both adjust your tips to your specific ear canal but also keep them clean.

Once you have set up the hearing aid, changing the settings is relatively easy. In the app there are four modes corresponding to what you are doing (nature, public, music and home) that can be tailored to reduce wind noise, increase bass, noise cancel and many more options. The app was well laid out for my grandfather - who is admittedly not the most technically proficient person, yet he found it intuitive and simple. As far as build quality, its what you would find on any other hearing aid, and we were happy with how they wrapped around the ear and comfort. My only gripe on the build quality would be the charging case. The plastic shell felt a little thin, and the clasp to close the lid could have been done better. I am use to earbud cases snapping closed, so it could just be a difference of preference as it was never anything my grandpa noted. On the topic of the case, it holds three additional charges after your hearing aids die, leading to several days worth of hearing. Three hours charging also nets you enough battery for 24 hours of hearing, Something nice is that the hearing aids automatically turn on when removed from the case and also turn off when placed back in, so you don’t have to worry about forgetting them on or fussing about turning them on.

Sound quality is very good, obviously not going to make anything sound better, but my grandfather did note how clear it was to hear in complex hearing environments due to him being able to change the settings to match the environment. This is different than his prior hearing aids as they were locked into one setting for all environments, but my grandfather noted that even if he never changed the settings, these performed better overall in almost every environment. This is due to the soundscape technology that Jabra has developed which my grandfather said made the average conversation sound sharper. Audio is a strong point, and I think that the app certainly helps, the best part is that if something seems off or you are having any problems, you can reach out through the app and have them adjusted at anytime. The app though, is not required to use the product.

Some cool features that these earbuds also have is that you can Bluetooth them to your phone and discreetly take phone calls/listen to any audio from your phone. This is as if your hearing aids are earbuds, which I think is super cool. It was easy to pair, and easy to switch over but did seem to drain battery life more… but not enough to be concerned. 

High Points:
-SoundScape Voice Clarity Tech
-Anywhere unlimited mobile adjustments for 3 years
-mobile rechargeable case
-easy to use app
-silver color really blended in well with my grandpas hair
-3 year warranty 
-IP68 water resistant rating

Low Points:
-Case could be more well built 


To sum this up, Jabra really made an all-star product. Yes it is still a pricy option, but it is a well made product with a warranty and adjustments guaranteed for three years which I think is almost unbeatable. The setup process is easy enough for the less tech savvy to still figure out and operate, and the adjustment process is easy enough that I find it better and faster than making an in person appointment and having them adjusted. All of this paired with a pretty nifty rechargeable case and really crisp, clear hearing in almost any environment is exactly what I was excited for when I heard about over the counter hearing aids becoming a thing. This is cheaper, faster and higher quality that what my grandfather was getting from his Dr, and it comes with some very cool Bluetooth options that were not previously available. The best part of the whole thing is when you buy this at Best Buy… you never have to worry about getting the wrong hearing aid for you, they have this model and several other variations as well to fit all needs and budgets. I loved this hearing aid for my grandpa, but it is a very subjective item … which is what makes Best Buy awesome as they have an excellent return policy and even better customer service, so you never have to worry about buying a the wrong product or product that you don’t like especially when they are as expensive as hearing aids."
184,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,No More Leap Reading!,"As I’ve gotten older my ability to hear conversations in noisy environments has slowly diminished to the point that it needs to be addressed.  I’ve looked at several OTC hearing aid solutions and was excited to recently receive the Jabra Enhance Select 300 – Gold Hearing Aids.  My wants were a solution that helped with hearing in all situations but more so in those louder environments like parties, restaurants, events, etc.  I also wanted a system that is affordable, low profile and customizable.  Well I can confidently say that the Jabra Enhance Select 300 hearing aids have met or exceeded my criteria and expectations.  

In The Box: The Select 300 is a complete system and ships with the 2 hearing aids, a charging case, extra receiver wires and domes for customizing the fit, a cleaning kit, sport locks for using the hearing aids when active and a user’s manual and setup cards.

Set Up: I’m not going to lie, when first opening the box, I was a bit concerned that fitment and setup would be a challenge.  The fact is it’s the exact opposite, Jabra has done a fantastic job of documenting the set-up process including a video call with an Audiology Team member to assist with proper fitment and set up.  As with most products today, there is an app to support the product and a QR code to assist in the process.  The Jabra Enhance Select app (as well as the included user’s manual) walk through setup and what I found to be cool is the hearing test and customized profile created for me based on my results.  During setup, a session with the Audiology team member is provided.

Audiology Zoom Meeting: When registering the Enhance Select 300 hearing aids on the app, Jabra provides an option to have an online meeting with an audiology expert.  Scheduling was done through the app and the specialist assigned to my meeting was ready to go at the scheduled day/time.  She could not have been any more professional and friendly.  She went through fitment and usage and determined that the booms should be a longer version for the best and most comfortable fit. She placed an order while we were on the call, and they shipped for free!  We have a follow up appointment set for a couple of weeks out to do a check in.  Way to go Jabra, this was an incredible experience!

Features: There are so many features packed into the Jabra Enhance Select 300, it’s hard to name them all.  For me, the SoundScape hearing technology addresses my issue of being able to hear conversation in loud environments.  This technology prioritizes speech over background noise so I don’t need to lean in and try to read lips anymore!  Customization through the Jabra Select App is another great feature, there are 4 main settings for hearing options.  They can also be adjusted based on hearing recommendations from Jabra or by the user.  The hearing aids support Bluetooth connection to listen to music and answer phone calls.  The list goes on and on.

Pros:

-	Very small design and virtually undetectable when wearing
-	Audiology Team Zoom meeting to setup and adjust according to your specific hearing needs
-	3 Years of warranty and support included
-	Convenient charging/storage case included
-	Battery life is more than sufficient for wearing all day

Cons:

-	After a couple weeks of use I have not had any issues or found any cons for this product

The Jabra Enhance Select 300 hearing aids are a great option for anyone looking for a high-end OTC hearing aid at a very reasonable price point. They are easy to setup and wear and the Jabra Audiology Team support is outstanding, I can’t say enough good things about this approach.  If you are considering this type of hearing solution, do yourself a favor and buy the Jabra Enhance Select 300!"
184,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Remarkable service and great sound,"I recently got the Jabra Enhance Select 300 hearing aids for my father and can easily say they are very well made, lightweight so they are comfortable to wear all day long.  They come in a well designed charging case that has a USB-C connector, cable and they even include the charger, which is a nice touch.  The battery life is great and if you’re on the road, a fully charged case will recharge the hearing aids at least 3 or 4 times. They also come with literally 10 little ziplock bags full of extra different size silicone ear tips (small, medium, large) to accommodate most ear canal sizes in addition to spare wax protectors, special design sport lock attachments, cleaning kit and all other necessary little tools for the waxguard  At first I was a bit weary of another set of OTC Hearing Aids, as I have gotten some for my elderly father from other vendors that were just not usable because of the constant feedback sounds.  Not so with these Jabra Enhance Select 300 hearing aids - they actually work as intended and they work quite well out of the box even with the default settings.

Jabra clearly put a lot of thought into the design, usability and setup documentation.  They were very easy to setup, with intuitive step by step, color coded “index cards” and a QR code for initial activation and smart phone App download.

The App is very well designed, with tons of useful settings, and an easy to use layout. The Proprietary Soundscape Technology really works to reduce background noise and emphasize what matters, voice and conversations.  There are several preset profiles such as All-around, Restaurant, Outdoors, as well as Music when you’re using these hearing aids for streaming like you would any high quality bluetooth earbuds.  Every profile can be customized to meet your individual hearing needs.

Aside from the great functionality, one of the main highlights of my dad’s experience with these hearing aids is the outstanding Jabra virtual care & support that includes zoom meetings with specialists from their dedicated Audiology Team. The 30-minute session we had was outstanding, followed by several emails with additional information and answers to our questions.  Moreover, they assisted with the proper fitting of the hearing aids, using the included ear measuring template.  They determined longer receiver wires are needed so they proceeded to expedite the shipping of the wires - all for free. Also, if you haven’t had a hearing test done by your doctor, you can do one on-line that will help Jabra tweak and optimize the settings that can be pushed remotely through the App by their Audiology Team.

All in all, the Jabra Enhance Select 300 hearing aids are an excellent OTC option at a reasonable price, especially considering the fantastic 3-year Jabra Audiology Team support."
184,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Outstanding sound and service!,"Jabra has long been my choice is earphones and now they are my first choice in hearing aids. I bought my first hearing aids for about seven years ago for my moderate to severe hearing deficits in spoken word ranges (probably too much music and machinery in my youth!). My first pair were custom ordered through an audiologist and cost thousands. They worked great and had a lot of features tied to my phone. While working virtually and wearing headphones, I stopped wearing them. Recently I looked into wearing them again and decided to try Jabra Enhance Select 300 and I am glad I had the opportunity! (Hearing aids became available over the counter in October 2022).

They were shipped to me and come well-packed and well-equipped. Left and right aids, charging case with cable, cleaning brush, multiple sizes and styles of ear pieces, wax guards and sport clips. Even an ‘ear measuring tool’ to make certain the hearing aid is sitting in the right spot on your ear. 

Start your setup by scanning the QR on the first card with your activation code and installing the app on your phone. Follow through on each card to learn about what you have and how things work. They have so many user guides and videos to help you on your journey to loving your hearing aids. Start wearing them a little at a time—if you are new to hearing aids, it does take a while to acclimate to them. (Don’t worry about the sound of your hair on the mic—it will become much less noticeable as you expand your use).

These hearing aids are quite comfortable. You will have an online meeting with an audiology doctor where you will go through the various steps and settings. I must say that my meeting with Amanda L. was fabulous! She walked me through all steps of wearing, cleaning, storing, etc., and I feel confident that she really cared about my hearing. She was able to check the fit of the wires and everything. She also helped me decide which style and size of ear pieces would work best for my hearing loss.

Now, personal comments. Again, if you are new to hearing aids, there will be an adjustment period. Don’t worry! Time will speed by while you get used to them. First, they are connected to your phone and you can change quite a few settings, both in the app and in your phone. My iphone saw them as alternate speakers and I was startled the first time the phone rang! Lol. Keep this in mind! On an iphone you can change various settings with the Jabra Enhance program and with the iphone (mic and speaker) settings. There are four basic ‘modes’- all around, restaurant, music and outdoor. You can change volume and the balance of speech vs noise filtering. 

The charging/storage case actually holds a charge itself! Can’t imagine when I might need that unless I was traveling. The earphone charge is good for 30 hours! Be sure to clean your hearing aids often and if you stop being able to hear, then you probably need to change the wax guard. 

Overall, I rate these hearing aids super high! With a three year warranty and so much help available, I feel that even someone new to hearing aids would be able to master their use!"

184,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Enhancing Life’s Moments Through Sound,"Love how I can hear my family jabber and choose to enhance my enviorment with differnt settings. I could hear the crickets chirping so clearly. It was insane how specific the sounds came through and I thought I could hear well enough. The hearing aids really do enhance my hearing. 

The thought that you can slowly lose hearing and realize it with an amazing product like the Jabra Enhance isn't a bad thing. I'm so glad technology has come far enough that a wire as thin as a hair wraps around my ear and can help with my hearing. 

A few of my favorite enhancements are noise cancelling, how light they are, battery life, and the mutliple features in the Jabra application. 

Form factors for me are important with any technology, especially those items that are on my person at all times or most of the day. The Enhance aids are about the size of a penne pasta noodle. There are mutilple ear cushions (the variations are noto endless but there are so many so that you find the comfort best for you). 


Now, the setup was concerining for me because these aids are delicate and I knew that I was going to have sound profiles to tailor for myself. However, Jabra's Enhance app walks you through it and essentially holds your hand and offers you with support as you progress. 

It's summer and getting closer to the holidays means that I'm going to be able to be a part of conversations in more meaningful ways. I sweat a lot and knowing that the Enhance aids are water resistant is awesome because I walk a lot in the eveings and I don't want to ruin these. 

Overall, this is going to be a great second half of 2024!"

I found this benefit extremely helpful as I am learning to maneuver my hearing aids."
184,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Discreet Hearing Aids in a Tiny Package,"The Jabra Enhance Select 300 hearing aids are wonderful for those who are hard of hearing and suffer from hearing loss.  They are not meant to be used for people who have significant hearing loss, hearing impaired or suffer from tinnitus from loud ringing concussive sounds.  I've lost hearing over the years from too many concerts when I was younger so I was looking forward to trying something that could help me hear easier without straining or missing words or asking people to repeat what they said.

So the main benefit of hearing aids as the name explains is they pick up and isolate sound you want to hear, like voices or directed noises and amplify the sound to the receiver in the hearing aid that delivers sound directly into your ear.  Another big benefit now with modern smart phones, is that they can be connected to your smart phone to function as a super fancy headphones.  

On my iPhone, registering my hearing aids and pairing to my iPhone was simple enough, however MAKE SURE you disconnect/forget any previous hearing aids in the Settings > Accessibility > Hearing Devices section or the Jabra hearing aids will not pair.  I had to try a few times before I realized why the Select 300s were not pairing to my phone and finally I disconnected my old pair of hearing aids.  

Basic setup was simple, walk through the Jabra Enhance Select app (different than the Sound+ app if you have normal Jabra headphones/buds) and it helps you pair everything and then calibrate sound to each ear.  In addition, you can schedule a support call with a Jabra audiologist that will help you further calibrate sound and address any concerns you might have.  I was really impressed with the level of support that was provided with the Select 300 and with the help of the audiologist, I was able to dial in optimal settings for both of my ears since my hearing is worse in my left ear compared to my right ear.

The case for the Select 300 is like a REALLY fancy headphone case with multiple status LEDs, a magnetic cradle that locks in and capacitively charges your hearing aids and a USB-C plug that allows you to charge from many different power sources.  The case itself is large but sturdy so it would be hard to lose and it provides around 4 days of power, as each 3 hour charge lasts about 24 hours and the case itself can hold 3 full charges, plus the 1 when the hearing aids are fully charged.  I think that's the most impressive part about these hearing aids, they are like super premium headphones but everything is shrunk down, you won't believe how tiny and concealed they are while wearing them.

The only negative that I am sure I will get used to is the design.  The body of the hearing aid sits behind your ear and then the receiver wires run over the top of your ear and the dome then fits snugly in your ear canal.  This process itself is somewhat cumbersome when you're not used to putting them in but after a few days I was already much faster at putting them in, kind of like getting used to contact lenses.  However, the other thing I didn't love was that when I was wearing sunglasses, I could feel them push against the body of the hearing aid.  This is something to be aware of for those who wear eye glasses, safety glasses or sunglasses a lot.  My older pair of hearing aids fit completely inside my ear canal and they were rigid/plastic so they were very easy to insert and remove and didn't interfere with my glasses.

Very happy with with these Jabra Select 300 hearing aids, I didn't see it on the BestBuy website but these should be FSA eligible, so you should be able to submit the receipt for reimbursement.  Make sure to check with your plan administrator if that is something you can take advantage of."
184,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Overall A Great Experience,"Overall a great experience. This was a wonderfully complete kit and set up. I loved everything about my experience. The kit was laid out with easy instructions on numbered cards as well as step-by-step instructions for connecting the hearing aids on the app. 

The only part I struggled with for set up was that I couldn't connect these new hearing aids at first because I already had one synced with my phone. I think the instructions are mostly for someone who has never had hearing aids before so the only improvement I would add is that, while they do mention disconnecting any other Bluetooth items nearby, they don't mention that you need to have your phone ""forget"" your previous hearing aid in order to connect with this hearing aid. I had assumed I could do both or that it would knock the other one off, I didn't realize I had to manually do that. Once I figured that out, however, it was easy. 

In terms of style and accessories the Jabra is similar to my previous aids. Both were behind the ear and about the same size. Both came with wax guard kit, domes, cleaning cloth and charger. However, I previously had to pay an extra $100 for a rechargeable travel case  but Jabra's charger is a rechargeable case automatically so that was a bonus. Additionally, the Jabra came with multiple kinds of domes, sport locks, an ear measuring tool and a receiver tool. It also came with a brush for cleaning the aid.
 
After initial set up of the aids and the app, I set up a video appointment. The soonest available was a week away. I also put in a request to have a remote adjustment. I am not sure if they typically would do that before the video appt but for me they didn't. I did answer a questionnaire for the appt ( the only issue I had here was that I ended up answering this questionnaire 3 different times. It didn't seem to know that I had already answered the questions and continued to prompt me to do it on separate occasions even after it said I completed it). I was also able to upload a previous audiogram from my records which was really a cool feature. 

I don't have hearing in my left ear so I mostly tested the aid in the way that I would normally wear it, which is just in my right ear. I connected easily to the Bluetooth on my phone for music and calls and could easily adjust volume and settings in the app. The sound quality appeared to be good in my general work and home environment but for my specific hearing needs, it was too quiet. I fall into a more severe hearing loss and was advised that these aids would not be my best choice, but for mild or moderate, I think they would be great. 

When the audio connected via Bluetooth it was actually so loud and vibrant that I thought it was on speaker phone or coming from the phone and not the aids and I had to take the aids out on a couple occasions to make sure I wasn't blasting music or calls at work. Thankfully, I wasn't. I will say that the quality of voice on Bluetooth felt somewhat radio-ish, the tone was not as natural as I would like, but I brought that up in the video call and was told that had to do with the kind of loss I have. I would probably want to experiment with that more. 

The video call was simple and informative, it was via zoom with a link. I scheduled an appt based on days and times given to me and just clicked on the link at the appointed time. The hearing specialist was friendly and walked me through all the included pieces in my kit. I actually learned a couple things that I hadn't been instructed on before with my previous audiologist. At the end of the video call,  the specialist also asked if I had any other questions and gave me time to respond without feeling rushed. 

I love that these aids have a 100 day trial period and 3 year warranty. I feel like the instruction cards and the interview were also very clear, honest and upfront about what these aids could or couldn't do for me. I really, really appreciate that. I was told that I could return these based on my audiogram needs, and I appreciate that they weren't trying to make me keep the aids regardless of my specific need. I felt the whole experience was professional, helpful, informative and honest and easy. 

I was impressed and would definitely recommend these for anyone in a mild to moderate hearing loss range.  I especially appreciated this note on the instruction cards: ""Hearing aids aren't like glasses. It may take time to adjust to new sounds. Don't worry, sound sensitivity is common and adjustments can be made through the app. If you bought the premium package, your hearing specialist will help you during orientation."" That's another reason why I love the 100 day return policy, it takes time to get a good fit for hearing loss and I fee like Jabra allows for that.

I was very impressed overall."
184,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Best hearing aids on the market in my opinion,"Prior to getting these hearing aids, audiologists previously told me I had moderate hearing loss. That’s what I knew going into deciding to try yet another pair of hearing aids. I had pretty much given up hope on any hearing aids working for me. When I saw these, I decided to give them a shot. The box arrived and I was pleased with the quality of the packaging and that made me hopeful. It was very attractive and very sturdy. The contents were well organized, and the supplied booklets of information were very complete with many online references to video tutorials and tech support. In the booklets, it tells you the expected life of the hearing aids is five years and the tubes, three years. No other hearing aids I’ve ever had tells you the life expectancy. I downloaded the app and familiarized myself with it and charged the hearing aids and case. Before putting in the hearing aids, I took a hearing test supplied by Jabra using my bluetooth headset. The results from that test stated I had severe hearing loss and that was a surprise to me. I’ve only been diagnosed as moderate up until this point. When I first put them in my ears, I was immediately impressed with the sound quality and the fit. I wore them with factory settings for a week and then had an orientation with Jabra support’s audiologist. Richard was great with his training and expertise. He took my hearing test and adjusted the settings to optimize the frequencies I struggle with. He also explained each of the 4 programs as well as the noise filter setting and the speech clarity setting. A problem I had was that the volume was not loud enough in any of the programs, and he was able to boost the volume to a more acceptable level. He instructed me to try it for a week and if I had any more problems, he provided me with his personal scheduling link so that we could work out any other issues. Richard also instructed exactly how to clean them and how to troubleshoot any problems. The fit was perfect for me right out of the box. The tubes were perfect length and the domes were just right for me. The batteries last a long time. After 16 hours of wear, the batteries are still at 60% when I put them in the case at night. I like that these are rechargeable as my previous ones had to use the tiny batteries that are so hard to handle. The only downside is the charging cable is way too short. 

I’ve worn these in loud restaurants and other noisy environments. Prior to meeting with Richard, went to the setting for restaurants and couldn’t adjust out the background noise and everything was far too noisy for my comfort. After the meeting where Richard optimized the settings based on my test, I was then able to wear them comfortably and still hear the people I was dining with. The big bonus is being able to open the app and adjust settings as necessary.  Once all the optimizations were made, I can go into the app, confident that I can use the noise filter correctly. After working with Richard, I just have to increase or decrease volume or change programs using the external buttons on the hearing aides. 

As far as the streaming goes, streaming although available, you’re unable to pause the streaming using buttons on the hearing aids. There is no pause or cancel button and you have to do it through the phone (in android, iPhone, this is possible.) This is the only negative thing I have to say about this unit aside from the short cord. I would highly recommend these for anyone, even over going to a commercial hearing aid store because the Jabra support is so thorough and available over zoom at my convenience."
184,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Next Level Hearing,"In the realm of over-the-counter hearing aids, the Jabra Enhance Select 300 has emerged as a formidable contender, garnering praise for its advanced features, discreet design, and exceptional customer service. As someone who has struggled with hearing loss for years, I can attest that this device has been nothing short of transformative, not just in terms of improved hearing but also in the peace of mind provided by Jabra's unparalleled support.
The first thing that struck me about the Jabra Enhance Select 300 was its sleek and inconspicuous design. The mini receiver-in-the-ear (RITE) style fits comfortably behind my ear, and its slim profile ensures that it's barely noticeable. This was a significant factor for me, as I was hesitant to wear bulky hearing aids that would draw unwanted attention.
But what truly sets the Jabra Enhance Select 300 apart is its advanced technology. Equipped with SoundScape proprietary speech clarity technology, these hearing aids deliver exceptional sound quality in a variety of environments. Whether I'm engaged in a conversation in a bustling restaurant or enjoying a concert outdoors, I can clearly hear the nuances of speech and music without being overwhelmed by background noise. This has made a world of difference in my social interactions and overall enjoyment of life.
The customization process was easy. I downloaded the Jabra Enhance app on my android and completed a hearing screening. The app then generated a personalized hearing profile that tailored the device's settings to my specific needs. While this doesn't replace a professional hearing assessment,but does a really good job of tayloring it to your settings needed. The app also allows me to further fine-tune the settings or switch between different listening environments with ease.
Perhaps one of the most compelling aspects of the Jabra Enhance Select 300 is its affordability. Compared to traditional hearing aids, which can cost thousands of dollars, the Jabra Enhance Select 300 is priced significantly lower, making it a more accessible option for individuals with hearing loss. This affordability, combined with its impressive performance and discreet design, makes it one of if not the best option on the market.
Thats not all the benefits. When you purchase the Jabra Enhance Select 300, you also gain access to a dedicated team of audiologists and hearing care professionals. This level of support is truly remarkable, and it has played a crucial role in my successful hearing journey.
From the moment I first contacted Jabra Enhance, I was impressed by their responsiveness. Their audiologists guided me through the setup process, answered all my questions patiently, and provided ongoing support through the app and phone consultations. Whenever I experienced any issues or needed adjustments, they were readily available to assist me remotely or schedule an in-person appointment if necessary.
This personalized care that I am a huge fan of, they ensuring that I get the most out of my hearing aids. It has allowed me to confidently navigate the challenges of hearing loss, knowing that I have good and nice people to help me if I need it. Be sure to get them if you need them."
184,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,A real life game changer,"In short, I'm impressed and would recommend these to anyone looking for OTC hearing aids. I've tried other OTC hearing devices before with less than stellar results and though I was hopeful I wasn't expecting these to be much better... and I was totally wrong. From the moment I first put these in, even before any tuning or tweaking at all, I could instantly hear much better. The difference wasn't subtle, I was hearing clocks tick and leaves rustling and all kinds of audible details I have been missing for years. Most importantly, in most cases I can now clearly hear my wife talking to me without needing to often ask her to repeat what she said -- this is seriously a genuine stress relief... for both of us.

The package includes a nice selection of open, closed, and tulip type ear domes in various sizes; and also the tools for basic maintenance such as a brush to clean the domes and ""sticks"" to replace the wax protectors as needed, usually every few months.

I'll also add that the online service and resources have been impressive at this price point. You can schedule a live orientation video meeting to learn about how to use them, there are videos that show you how to perform regular cleaning and maintenance, and if you don't like your audio settings you can generate a request within a day or so (often less) you'll get a notice in the app that adjusted settings are available to apply -- and if you don't like the new settings the app also lets you rollback to the previous settings which in my case proved quite useful.

There are 4 modes that can be cycled through using either the app or by long-pressing the button on the back of either bud; all around, restaurant, music, and outdoors. And you can tell which mode you've selected by the beeps 1, 2, 3, and 4 beeps respectively in the order above. I use all-around mode most of the time but the restaurant mode has proven to be helpful when I'm in a noisy spot but only really want to hear the people I'm seated closest to and are mostly in front of me.

When I first put them in my ears would get itchy after an hour or so but after just a day I was already getting to the point of having them in for hours and literally forgetting they were even in.

Most weekdays I work alone, with a headset or headphones on for calls and meetings, and so I don't wear these; but as soon as I'm home or in public I'll pop these in to improve my awareness and interactions with family and friends. That they are Bluetooth capable is a boon as well. Music through them doesn't have a lot of depth but phone calls are clear and no one complained about being able to hear me.

Seriously, for OTC hearing aids I couldn't be happier. No exaggeration, these were everything I hoped they would be and more."
184,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"Jabra hearing Aids, best I have ever experienced!","I have tried and lived with hearing aids from 3 different companies.  All have worked okay, but were lacking in different ways from what I was seeking.  JABRA hearing aids have been an exception, and are all that I have hoped for in hearing aids.  Lets start with the packaging:  The aids came with fitting template, large easy to read sealed queue cards labeled 1 to 6 with extremely easy to follow directions.  The owners manual, extra hearing aid small medium and large tips, wax protectors, special SPORT Lock attachment for vigorous activities that could dislodge the aids, charging cable with wall plug (many devices no longer provide the wall plug adaptor, only the USB C cable).  The First Queue card has a large QR code for scanning.  This QR code contains activation codes and enable the user to install the needed app and see videos in seconds without any data address or serial number entry.  In short, a very quick easy getting started install.  The JABRA select app was easy to use and allows for prompt refinements so that settings may be customized, or selected from settings designed for All-Around, Restaurant, Music, or Outdoors to filter wind sounds.  No hunting, sub menus, just highly visible choice icons.  There are sliders to filter noise, and enhance speech clarity as well.  This all about improving hearing, and to that end,  JABRA provides in home Audiogram testing.  The user must put on a headphone, or in ear listening device such as my Apple AirPods.  Tones at varying frequencies are used to determine one’s hearing strengths and weaknesses.  Based on the results, the audiogram is reviewed by an audiologist and the hearing aids are synched via bluetooth to receive refined settings.  It was amazing to me how the refinements set the Jabra hearing aids to enhance my hearing.  This was a cut above my competing existing aids.  Jabra set a new standard.  The Jabra process also provided a Zoom call to be scheduled with a hearing audiologist.  I did so and couldn’t be more happier with the 30 minute one-on-one call.  The expert had me pllace the hearing aid template on my ear and said that even though I was pleased with the size of the ear tips, the wire connector, she felt I might be even more pleased with slightly longer wire connectors based on her observation of the closeup I provided to the Zoom camera.  She immediately ordered this new set of wires at no charge and recommended I try them.  The audiologist answered all questions and surprised me with her knowledge of my iPhone (it contained the Jabra App).   I asked if she could tell me how to have all incoming phone calls automatically routed to my Jabra hearing aids so that I wouldn’t have to put my iPhone up against my ear.  She walked me through the settings in 2 minutes and then tested the settings by phoning me!  She asked if I would like to schedule a follow up call in a week or so, and I did so.  In short, this level of service was exceptional.  My wife came by and asked when i was going to test the hearing aids, to which I replied I was wearing them.  She was shocked and said she couldn’t even tell as they were in the ear and not visible, other than the tiny clear wire that connected with the tiny microphones hidden behind my ear (smaller than my other hearing aids).  Other features I liked were the fact that the hearing aids used rechargeable batteries that charged by simply inserting them in the provided case.  Tiny lights revealed the level of charge.  The charger was portable with it’s own rechargeable batteries.  In short, you could put the hearing aids in the case, and the case in a pocket.  The case would be able to charge the batteries.  The case itself has a cable and plug so that it may be charged after  3 or 4 hearing aid recharge cycles.  I have been using the hearing aids during all waking hours, and they go 2 days without the need for charging.  Note:  The hearing aids are not waterproof, so they have to be removed for swimming, showers, etc.  The Jabra select 300 are superb in every respect, especially in personal service.  I highly recommend them."
184,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Great product with remote online audiologists!,"I have worn hearing aids for around 4 years now. My first set was a major brand sold at a great price compared to the local hearing aid dealer at an out-of-town discount warehouse club. I have friends that paid over quadruple what I paid at their local dealer. My issue with the discount club program is that even calling a couple of weeks before going to the city where I purchased the hearing aids I have yet to be able to get my hearing test and thus hearing aids updated. On a couple of occasions, they adjusted the hearing aids without testing me.  About a year ago I got a chance to test the Jabra Select 50r and I love them. With the 50r and the 300 model that I just switched to, I can take an online hearing test or upload an audiogram and have my hearing aids adjusted by downloading the updates provided by a Jabra staff audiologist. I took the online test and uploaded an audiogram from my ENT's clinic. After receiving both of the Jabra hearing aids I received an online interview and orientation with a Jabra audiologist. At the online meeting usage and fit were covered as well as any questions I had. I was told both times, that the results from the online test were very similar to the much more in-depth audiogram that I sent in. The audiologist was able to fine tune my hearing aids from the online test results to the audiogram results, all while I sat at my home! This is a huge improvement over me not being able to be retested throughout several years with my original hearing aids.
     There are a number of differences between the model 50 and this model 300. Both models stream from my phone. Music streaming isn't like my high-end earbud sound quality, but it's very nice to be able to just turn it on anywhere. The model 300 adds hands free calling. I noticed a marked improvement in being able to hear in a noisy restaurant over the previous model. Depth of sound, acoustics and the complexity of available remote adjustments are improved in the model 300. The charging case battery will recharge the hearing aids 3 times on the go. I have yet to deplete the batteries of the hearing aids while wearing them through my daily activities. The hearing aids are water resistant. There is an app included which allows you to adjust the hearing aids through the preset modes as well as customize the settings of each mode. The model 300 adds a music listening mode. The app also connects you to the Jabra staff audiologists for help or adjustments.
     I am extremely happy with the performance of my Jabra model 300 hearing aids. I had no complaints about the previous model, and both were a huge improvement over my original aids. While the performance of the hardware is great, the greatest improvement is to be able to reach Jabra's audiology staff for help and adjustments from the comfort of home!"
184,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Better than even custom fit hearing aids,"I'll admit it takes a lot to write this review, the hearing loss is not something I like to discuss or even admit in many cases, but there's a lot to be said about these. 

Packaging: 
It's a premium look and feel and really one would hope so at this price point, the box is well designed, the included accessories are thoughtful, which includes a set of cards with very easy to follow instructions on setup that even were I not a tech savvy individual, there would be no challenges getting them going. 

Setup: 
As mentioned there's 6 cards included in a separate sealed pouch that lay out in simple steps the setup. Admittedly many individuals looking for devices like these may not have the level of tech expertise or exposure that other types of devices, including Bluetooth headsets, may have. These cards make setup simple and easy to follow. 

Fit: 
This is where I had a lot of concern. Being that hearing aids like this are kind of ""one size"" I did worry that they'd either be more visible than I'd prefer or not fit as well as I'd hope. I was wrong on both counts. Now that being said, they are definitely still visible, but i suppose some of that will also depend on the size of an individuals ear and how well it can hide the external part. Some simple adjustments make the rest of the unit fit inside the ear comfortably.

Performance: 
In a word, wow. I was skeptical about the statements of being able to hear well in noisy environments, but they really deliver. The sound is natural and delivers well. The features to connect via Bluetooth to the phone are great. There's a couple of more advanced options that can be adjusted, but honestly out of the box they work amazingly. A couple of notes here: the battery life is good, but what's great is the charging speed, much like true wireless headsets these come with a charging unit that is portable and holds additional charges, the literature claims 3.5 hours to full charge and I'd have to agree. Battery life claims 30 hours max and while i did come up short on that I'm sure a lot of that has to do with environment, being in a noisy place they'll have to work harder, likewise with or without Bluetooth, that said they still deliver well over a full day of use which is all I can really wish for.

Recommendation: 
A resounding Yes. If you're in the market, just get them. I don't know how better to say it."
184,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,deliver exceptional performance,"I recently received the  these hearing aids, and they have exceeded all my expectations. These customizable hearing aids, supported by a dedicated Audiology Team, offer unparalleled personalization tailored to individual hearing needs. The ability to virtually meet with the Audiology Team for custom programming ensures a perfect fit, enhancing my overall listening experience.

The SoundScape™ hearing technology is a game-changer. In noisy environments like busy restaurants or offices, the speech clarity is remarkable. This proprietary technology prioritizes speech and significantly reduces background noise, allowing me to hear conversations clearly, even in challenging situations.

One of my favorite features is the hands-free phone call capability, especially with my iPhone 11. It functions seamlessly, just like high-quality earbuds. Additionally, the Bluetooth streaming feature for calls, music, and media integrates perfectly with both Apple and Android devices, keeping me connected effortlessly.

The discreet “mini” design of the Select 300 is another standout. It's lightweight and nearly invisible, providing all-day comfort without compromising on advanced technology. The included portable charging case is incredibly convenient, offering over 24 hours of listening on a single 3-hour charge and holding three full charges.

The Jabra Enhance Select app further enhances the user experience, allowing easy control of the hearing aids and remote adjustments from the Audiology Team. This advanced personalization is particularly beneficial in difficult listening situations, making the Select 300 a versatile and indispensable tool.

Overall, the Select 300 hearing aids deliver exceptional performance and convenience, making them an outstanding investment for anyone seeking high-quality, customizable hearing solutions. I wholeheartedly give them a five-star rating."
184,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Jabra Enhancd Select 300 Hearing Aids fantastic,"Overview

The Jabra Enhanced Select 300 Hearing aids are fantastic.  The quality is awesome.  Case is a bit large but you won’t lose it for sure.  The Hearing aids themselves very unnoticeable, no one knows I have them on.  The larger piece which goes behind the top of the ear hides very well.  The clearish wires blend in very well with the ear so people don’t see them clearly and therefore don’t notice.

Sound and improvement for impaired hearing:

The sounds and improvement in my hearing is astounding.  I am hearing people when they talk softly to me so not to disturb other folks.  It is good to hear more fully once again.  I can hear television and music without having to blast everyone else out of the room.

Installation and setup

Download the app which is easy and follow the setup steps.  The app walks you step by step and tunes the hearing aids due to your hearing.  There are tests that you take which determines what sounds you hear and which sounds you can’t and then tweaks the hearing aids accordingly.

The Doctor’s office setup these test online and after evaluation will tweak them more to get them more accurate.  Then they set up a zoom call to meet with the doctor to discuss the hearing aids and the findings with you personally.

A stellar product that actually works very well.  Highly recommend these to anyone that is needing hearing aids.  The case holds a charge so you can just simply place the hearing aids in the case and let them charge overnight and ready for the next day. 

Battery Life

The battery life is really good.  I wore them all day and still have 60% state of charge before I go to bed and fully charged the next morning.  Ready to go."
184,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Great All Around Hearing Aids,"The Jabra Enhance Select 300 hearing aids are surprisingly comfortable and easy to use. I have mild hearing problems when in large group settings, or in noisy environments. These definitely help! Also, I wasn’t sure how well the “over the ear” style would work with glasses, but it isn’t an issue at all. 

The app has tons of features that more expensive hearing aids don’t offer, which makes it simple to adjust and fine tune based on your surroundings (restaurants, outdoors, etc). 

The battery life is outstanding! Wearing them all day will not deplete the battery, and I’ve never had them go below 60% even after using them 16+ hours straight. The charging case recharges the hearing aids quickly and also holds many “recharges” before needing to get recharged itself. 

The Bluetooth feature allows you to use as standard earbuds. However, they don’t provide great sound quality when listening to music, so don’t expect them to replace your earbuds which are meant for music!

After about 1 week of wearing the hearing aids, I had the live Zoom meeting with Jabra’s hearing specialist to personalize my settings, and help me walk through all the features on the device. They used my hearing test results to personalize the settings for each ear, and they were incredibly knowledgeable and helped answer all my questions. 

Overall I couldn’t be happier with this device, and recommend it to anyone that can use a boost in their hearing."
184,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Good Performance And Easy To Use,"The Jabra Enhance Select 300 are a set of hearing aids from Jabra that marries traditional hearing aid technology with an app that lets you personalize the behavior and also support traditional wireless earbud capability - taking calls and listening to music. For this review, a relative who has experienced hearing loss trialed the device.

In the box, you’ll get the hearing aids, charging case plus a cord, a cleaning brush and cloth, ear measurement tool, sizing tips, and the setup guides. The charging case looked like just another wireless headset case. It has a battery that can be charged and it charges the hearing aids when docked inside. The hearing aids themselves look like traditional ones with the main unit sitting just behind the ear and what looks like acoustic tubing to the piece that goes into your ear canal. This helps give it a more concealed look. The ear measurement tool is used for determining the best length receiver wire for you. As this is not adjustable, it seems pointless to include it unless one is able to get a swap on the hearing aid if the sizing is not optimal.

After getting the correct earbud tip, the first thing is getting the correct one into each ear. Unlike regular earbuds, telling left and right is a bit more subtle. Held facing forward, the receiver cable kinda curves inwards toward the ear so that’s a decent way to tell. However, the earbuds are also color coded with a blue dot on the left and red on the right. So between those two indicators, one should be able to get them in consistently. You’d place the behind the ear part first then insert the earbud fully into the canal so that they’re not even visible externally. While that looked uncomfortable, I was told that this is normal for hearing aids and the tip felt smooth while providing good retention inside the ear.

Pairing to the app was pretty straightforward. Even though there are tactile buttons on the hearing aid, like other bluetooth earbuds nowadays, it powers on automatically when removed from the charging case and by default is in pairing mode. The Jabra Enhance Select app then just walks through the process of detecting and pairing them. The app has a bunch of presets to select the environment you’re in to customize the hearing aids. There’s also automatic volume control which I’m told was a great feature as it avoided occurrences when the hearing aids can drive too loud because of a sudden change in ambient sound or volume from a conversation. One can also customize presets further, tweaking treble, bass, and “middle”. These are normal audio filter controls but I guess also work for normal speech clarity.

Performance wise, it was reported that these did a good job in daily activities. It was appreciated that one could take calls wirelessly and could tweak profiles when in a quiet environment, restaurant, or walking in the park. They did report a couple potential issues. It only happened twice but there was cases of whistling when talking on a phone normally (not over bluetooth) and holding the phone up to the ear (with hearing aids). Shifting the phone made the whistling go away and it did not return for the duration of the call. The second was battery life. Having the bluetooth streaming capability meant these got used to play audio from the phone which impacted battery life. Streaming music, the earbuds lasted for about 6 hours before needing to be charged. The case can recharge them up to three times which means you still get all day battery life and they didn’t really listen to more than 6 hours of music daily, but it does mean there’s potentially a 1-3 hour period of time that you’re waiting for the battery to charge. Luckily, it seems just charging for about 15 minutes gives a decent amount of normal “hearing aid” runtime which made it convenient to charge up, use, then have a longer period of charge time commuting between two locations.

Ultimately, the conclusion was that the Enhance Select 300 did a good job, was easy to use, and provided useful customization. Battery life is something to plan for if you’ll use these in music mode but as just a hearing aid, the life is great and the charging case removes any real anxiety regarding battery life when out and about during the day."

There’s also automatic volume control which I’m told was a great feature as it avoided occurrences when the hearing aids can drive too loud because of a sudden change in ambient sound or volume from a conversation. One can also customize presets further, tweaking treble, bass, and “middle”. These are normal audio filter controls but I guess also work for normal speech clarity.

Performance wise, it was reported that these did a good job in daily activities. It was appreciated that one could take calls wirelessly and could tweak profiles when in a quiet environment, restaurant, or walking in the park. They did report a couple potential issues. It only happened twice but there was cases of whistling when talking on a phone normally (not over bluetooth) and holding the phone up to the ear (with hearing aids). Shifting the phone made the whistling go away and it did not return for the duration of the call. The second was battery life. Having the bluetooth streaming capability meant these got used to play audio from the phone which impacted battery life. Streaming music, the earbuds lasted for about 6 hours before needing to be charged. The case can recharge them up to three times which means you still get all day battery life and they didn’t really listen to more than 6 hours of music daily, but it does mean there’s potentially a 1-3 hour period of time that you’re waiting for the battery to charge. Luckily, it seems just charging for about 15 minutes gives a decent amount of normal “hearing aid” runtime which made it convenient to charge up, use, then have a longer period of charge time commuting between two locations.

Ultimately, the conclusion was that the Enhance Select 300 did a good job, was easy to use, and provided useful customization. Battery life is something to plan for if you’ll use these in music mode but as just a hearing aid, the life is great and the charging case removes any real anxiety regarding battery life when out and about during the day."
184,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Great All Around Hearing Aids,"The Jabra Enhance Select 300 hearing aids are surprisingly comfortable and easy to use. I have mild hearing problems when in large group settings, or in noisy environments. These definitely help! Also, I wasn’t sure how well the “over the ear” style would work with glasses, but it isn’t an issue at all. 

The app has tons of features that more expensive hearing aids don’t offer, which makes it simple to adjust and fine tune based on your surroundings (restaurants, outdoors, etc). 

The battery life is outstanding! Wearing them all day will not deplete the battery, and I’ve never had them go below 60% even after using them 16+ hours straight. The charging case recharges the hearing aids quickly and also holds many “recharges” before needing to get recharged itself. 

The Bluetooth feature allows you to use as standard earbuds. However, they don’t provide great sound quality when listening to music, so don’t expect them to replace your earbuds which are meant for music!

After about 1 week of wearing the hearing aids, I had the live Zoom meeting with Jabra’s hearing specialist to personalize my settings, and help me walk through all the features on the device. They used my hearing test results to personalize the settings for each ear, and they were incredibly knowledgeable and helped answer all my questions. 

Overall I couldn’t be happier with this device, and recommend it to anyone that can use a boost in their hearing."
184,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Good Performance And Easy To Use,"The Jabra Enhance Select 300 are a set of hearing aids from Jabra that marries traditional hearing aid technology with an app that lets you personalize the behavior and also support traditional wireless earbud capability - taking calls and listening to music. For this review, a relative who has experienced hearing loss trialed the device.

In the box, you’ll get the hearing aids, charging case plus a cord, a cleaning brush and cloth, ear measurement tool, sizing tips, and the setup guides. The charging case looked like just another wireless headset case. It has a battery that can be charged and it charges the hearing aids when docked inside. The hearing aids themselves look like traditional ones with the main unit sitting just behind the ear and what looks like acoustic tubing to the piece that goes into your ear canal. This helps give it a more concealed look. The ear measurement tool is used for determining the best length receiver wire for you. As this is not adjustable, it seems pointless to include it unless one is able to get a swap on the hearing aid if the sizing is not optimal.

After getting the correct earbud tip, the first thing is getting the correct one into each ear. Unlike regular earbuds, telling left and right is a bit more subtle. Held facing forward, the receiver cable kinda curves inwards toward the ear so that’s a decent way to tell. However, the earbuds are also color coded with a blue dot on the left and red on the right. So between those two indicators, one should be able to get them in consistently. You’d place the behind the ear part first then insert the earbud fully into the canal so that they’re not even visible externally. While that looked uncomfortable, I was told that this is normal for hearing aids and the tip felt smooth while providing good retention inside the ear.

12,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Very pleased with My Lexie hearing aids.,"I’m very pleased with my Lexie hearing aids. I can wear just one hearing aid since one ear has a harder time hearing than the other. I can control the volumes and environments, etc. through my iPhone. There was a hearing test with the app to have them help me set the settings for my ears on these hearing aids. These come with different size domes and styles. I stare with a small but realized it was coming out of my ear canal too easy so I went ups size and that helped. The information said they are not made for music or podcasts. But I have tried both and they are fine. Just keep the storage case close by. I have taken a phone call with them in and I and the party I was talking to could hear well."
12,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Lexie powered by Bose hearing aids,Great hearing aids. After hearing test with an ENT physician determined my hearing loss I took a chance and ordered them online from Best Buy. They work great and it has improved my quality of life immensely.
12,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Comfortable and discreet,"I got these for my Father-in-law, a 66yo US Army vet with significant hearing loss from serving on various military operations.  Overall, the general consensus was that it is incredibly comfortable to wear, easy to set up and operate, and discrete.  The Lexie B2 is a great direct-to-customer product (no need for a visit to an audiologist/ENT) at a reasonable price point- my understanding on cursory research on pricing indicated that hearing aids are TYPICALLY around the $2-3k price point, which is outrageous for what is essentially a glorified set of AirPods.  The sound tech is provided Bose, a company I would consider a reputable, audio equipment supplier- they're known to be highly protective of their IP and technology and even their standard headphones are considered some of the best at reasonable costs.  

SET UP
A smartphone + Lexie app isn't required for normal operation/use but you DO REQUIRE them for the initial set up and programming.  General set up steps:

1. Answer questions to rule out any serious medical conditions
2. Go through tutorial for selecting the ear tips and pairing the phone to the hearing aids
3. Step-by-Step Hearing Check (should be done in a quiet room with little to no ambient noise)
4. Review of your ability to detect/perceive sounds at low to high pitched frequencies

APP AND CONTROLS
The Lexie app give you options to control the volume and directionality of the hearing aids.  Volume controls are also available as tactile buttons on the hearing aids themselves so, once again, the app is not necessary.  The directionality adjustment is so that you can adjust for concentrating audio input depending on your setting; for example, if you're in a noisy cafe and want to have a conversation with someone seated across from you, you can change the setting to focus on sounds in front of you.  

SMARTPHONE COMPATIBILIITY
Apple: All current iPhones going back to the iPhone 6S. 
Android: All Android devices with Android 7.0 or above (as of December 2022, the current revision is Android 13)

BATTERY - BEST FEATURE OF THE LEXIE B2
The Lexie B2 uses a rechargeable, lithium-ion battery and provides up to 18 hours of normal use on a full charge.  It takes ~3 hours for a full charge. I would recommend taking them out in the evening and putting them back in their case for charging during the evenings.  This set up is very similar to how normal ear buds like Apple AirPods operate. This is a departure from the Lexie B1, which had a longer 52-hour runtime but used a replaceable 312 battery (the ""standard"" hearing aid battery).  If you have any experience with those tiny batteries, buying replacements do add up quite a bit and working with them can be difficult for people with limited dexterity in their fingers.  

FEEDBACK FROM MOTHER-IN-LAW

""He heard me from the other side of the house (20 meters); normally, I have to be within 4-5 meters""
""He likes them!!"""
12,BestBuy,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,Extreme light and comfortable but..,"I gotta say that these Lexie B2 hearing aids are very well made. These are powered by bose but when you look at the packaging, content and built quality of the device, they look just like a Bose. Even the charging case and hearing aids have the Bose branding on it. The actual devices are small and conceal themselves very well behind the ears. They are lightweight and feel comfortable when wearing. I suffer from hearing loss but I currently don’t use hearing aids despite the fact that I can't hear certain frequencies. This is the first time I tried such a thing and from a person who never used hearing aids, I can say they felt comfortable. 

Setting them up I can relate to be easy. Download the Lexie app and pair the hearing aids. I encountered what may be a glitch with the app. Every time I open it up I end up on a screen where it says “continue from where you left off”. You have the option to sign out, restart or continue. I’m not sure if that’s how the app is supposed to behave but is annoying. Once you pass that then you can actually engage with the device settings. You have the option to adjust the world volume and the treble, base and L/R balance . You can also choose which direction you want to hear whether it is front or everywhere. The front direction actually works well, especially when talking to someone or watching TV. When you enable the everywhere setting you can notice the difference between the two. The app is very simple to use, you can also setup your own custom environment settings. That being said, those settings are pretty much like presets that you can create, but honestly the only thing you can adjust no matter what preset you use is the volume, treble and base. 

The sound quality is ok. It sounds like you're in a tunnel per se , that's the closest way I can describe it. It just didn't sound natural, especially when raising the volume at a higher level you can hear yourself. These hearing aids will be good for someone who suffers from moderate to severe hearing loss in my opinion and that's because this allows you to hear all frequencies. For someone like myself who has issues only with high frequencies will not be suitable. For instance, I raised the volume up around 50 and I was able to hear the high pitch I have issues with but then everything else was too loud and became annoying. Another thing to note: I suffer from tinnitus and this device was not able to mask it.  

When it comes to battery life the manufacturer suggests the battery will last around 18hrs. I can vouch that you can go through the entire day with no issues. The charging case is just that, it only charges, it does not recharge your device on the go which is a bummer from a device that costs this much. I looked around the user manual and it does not state the case will charge your device unless it is plugged. The case itself is a little bit bulky and uses a USB-C connection for charging and does not support wireless charging. These hearing aids also come with different size tips and a cleaning tool. 

Overall this device will work well for the specific group that is targeted which in my opinion is for people who suffer from moderate to severe hearing loss. If you suffer from a specific frequency loss I’ll suggest going to a professional and have them make something specifically just for you. The device has great built quality, it is easy to use, is small and discrete, and is very comfortable. It has a battery life that will get you throughout the day with no problem. You also get 2 years of expert care with your purchase. On another note this device is very expensive for what you are actually getting. In the box you get the hearing aids, charging case, USB-C cable, ear tips, cleaning tool and manuals."
12,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"Can skip the Audiologist, aka middleman!","My father is approaching his 70s and starting to lose his hearing.  Despite what my stubborn father says, he has some kind of hearing loss as he’s constantly saying “what” or “huh” when his kids or grandkids speak.  Getting him to the Audiologist would be next to impossible so these OTC hearing aids came just in time.

Pros:
*Fits well out of the box
*Charge case works well
*Nearly invisible when worn
*Batteries are rechargeable 

Cons:
*Slow to connect to app
*Cannot stream music or take calls
*App doesn’t have a hearing test

The latest FDA allowed OTC hearing aids to be sold as early as October 2022 and this allows consumers to buy hearing aids over the counter and without a need for an Audiologist visit.  This significantly reduces the overall price and added convenience.  Hearing aids from an Audiologist can average north of $3,000.  With that being said, the Lexie B2 is a bargain.  We also knew that a Behind-the-Ear version would be best suited for my father.

Setup was quite easy but my father did need my assistant to help him with the initial setup.  It comes with a template that hangs on your ears to determine the length of wire is needed.  It only comes with one length out of the box but additional sizes can be ordered.  Just hope that you would be considered “average” or you will be stuck waiting for a new set of wires to arrive.  Luckily for my father, the prepackaged wires were just his size.  Pairing the hearing aids to the accompanying Lexie app was easy and the app even walks you through the whole process of correct fitment.  It does come with small, medium and large ear domes for even better in canal fitment.

Once setup, the Lexie we received was already partially charged so you can get them started right away.  Upon full charge, they should last around 18 hours and only takes 3 hours to fully charge when depleted.  The app is easy and simple enough to use for my elderly father.  You can adjust the volume and different listening scenarios from the app.  Not too much needed in the app to confuse the end user so that’s a nice touch.  Upon the initial setup, no really big need to open the app after.  The hearing aids themselves only have 2 buttons on it.  Volume UP and volume DOWN.  While that’s easy enough, the buttons are tiny and the down button, if long pressed, turns on/off each hearing aid.  My father has dexterity issues and adjusting the volume is challenging.  He sometimes turns off one ear by accident by pressing too long on the button.  This can be solved if Lexie has a different off button than the one tied to the volume.  The Lexie does turn off automatically when you insert them into the charging case but it doesn’t automatically turn on when you take them out of the charging case.  You have to turn each individually on by a long press of the tiny volume down button.  

Things that Lexie could improve on are:
1.	Faster app connection
2.	In app hearing test (none available now but is available on their website)
3.	Add a 3rd button to control power or listening scenarios.
4.	Make the volume buttons larger
5.	Automatically turn on when you take them out of the charging case

Overall, I do recommend Lexie B2 Behind-The-Ear to anyone, or anyone’s parents/grandparents that have hearing issues.  They sound great, thanks to Bose and does the trick on amplifying sounds that mattered."
12,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Discreet & lightweight,"I got these for my husband because he has minor hearing loss from playing guitar in bands. They are very discreet, with clear wires, rather small in size & fit nicely behind the ear. No one even noticed he was wearing them. Easy to use, can regulate volume, balance, mute left or right individually, control treble & bass through the app, there are four different environment settings which include everyday, music, noisy indoor & outdoors with everyday setting being the best.  Battery power is ok, if you wear them all day, every day, you will charge them every night. They make voices & sounds pretty clear, as far as music environment setting goes if you turn it up above 20 it will feedback but otherwise thy dint whistle like regular hearing aids do.  He said they really help him hear much clearer. Sometimes they are difficult to pair through Bluetooth & have to be put back in the charging case so they power down & can be restarted. Included is a convenient charging case which is small enough to take with you, cable, ear fit guide, extra domes & a cleaning brush."
12,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Great Fit - Super Effective and Comfortable !,"A little about my own hearing loss - As clinically measured I have 45-60% hearing loss ( depending on range ) in one ear
as a result of scarring, repeated rupture of eardrum etc. The other ear is normal. This results in a very unbalanced world
that I am adjusted to but it does present a lot of minor annoyances - especially when it comes to speech. 

Overall Impressions - I opened the box, charged them and walked through setup in a few minutes using the app and 
an online setup guide. After trying a few scenarios with my television, others having a conversation and using a 
speakerphone I found just the right spots for indoor use. I then took a walk and tweaked them a bit more for an 
outside environment. They work well ! The selective directional boost and ""world volume"" let me balance things out 
to around what would have been roughly normal prior to hearing loss. In my circumstance, I still have near perfect
hearing in one ear and this works effectively to balance things out. To me the most important boost is clarity of 
speach which these excellent for !

Fit and Comfort - After a few minutes these just disappear and you will likely forget you are wearing them.
While I don't need these in every situation, I wore them for 12+ hours at a time without any discomfort.

Software - I tested the application and pairing on an Iphone. It took a a few minutes to setup and was 
simple to use. Push the buttons and move the sliders. The layout is well labelled and intuitive. It also 
works correctly with scaling / zoom enabled. 

What I love - 
IP67 Water resistance !
2 day battery life

Could be improved - 
SOFTWARE - Please add independant tuning controls for those of us with hearing damage in only one ear !
Phone calls - Cannot be fed directly through to the hearing aids however I am able to use an iphone as 
normal on my left side now."
12,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Great fit good sound.,"My mother in law has lost her hearing over the years and has had several hearing aids over the course of this life event.

She does.not always wear them because they either don't fit well or are not comfortable so having conversations with her without them can be hard at times.

Bose's heading aids takes the in to account comfort so right off the bat she was willing to wear these more often than her in older ones.

Setup.

Setup was pretty easy.  Follow the on boarding screen and you are in.  For younger folks this is easy.  But for non technical older folks we had to sit down and walk her through it.

Operation

Is decent.  Easy to put in and wear.  It did not fall out and using the software to dial in specific listening conditions is nice.

Battery life is good.  Carrying case is nice to me have.magnets so it is less likely to be lost.  Comes with different size ear buds so that is nice.

Only cons are the 2.  Powering on is a little hard with the 2 small buttons especially for my mom in law due to her age.  Also the re pairing to phone is confusion her every time she opens the app it asks her to walk through the pairing routine.  Once again for older folks this is harder but we help her with that.

Other than that if you are good with tech and have good hand eye coordination with the small power button this is a good hearing aid system and would recommend it based on my experience."
12,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Filled with great features and so lightweight.,"This Lexie B2 Hearing Aid powered by Bose has so many pros, that the only 2 cons seem irrelevant. First of all the setup is very easy. Once you charge the hearing aid and install the Lexie Application on your smartphone, it’s a piece of cake. A little bit about the hearing aid, before I dive deep. The hearing aid is super lightweight. It’s so lightweight that I forget I have them in. The on button, which doubles as a World Volume button is on both the left and right. The case is specifically coded in red and blue marks for the left and right aids. The charging cord is a USB-A to USB-C, which connects to the charging case. There are 4 sets of earbuds/domes included, one of which is installed already. There is a cleaning brush included too. There is also a fitting card that helps you get the best fit. The user manual and instructions are very clear and easy to understand.

Now about the features. The best thing is the Lexie Application. The application allows you to setup and manage all of the settings for the hearing aid. The adjustable settings are amazing. You have your balance for each ear. World Volume is the overall volume control that allows you to either make sounds louder or quieter. Treble and Bass allow you to set it to your liking. You have directionality, which allows you to set it up for everywhere or for someone in front of you for a one on one conversation. The balance allows you to set it for more on the left or right, or equally balanced between both ears. Environment settings allow you to set your hearing aid for music, noisy indoor, noisy outdoor and everyday. To use your heading aid with phone calls, just put the phone to your ear like normal and the hearing aid will do the rest. 

The audio quality is amazing. I can hear so well, without any feedback or static noise. I can mute it as well, if needed. I can watch TV, listen to the radio in the house or car, and hear everything just fine. The hearing aids will take a bit to get used to. You have to read the manual and get to know them. You will not be completely comfortable in any hearing aid right out of the box. It takes time and patience, learning what is best for you and learning what settings work best for you. I highly recommend this over the counter hearing aid. It has only two cons, but they aren’t bad at all. The hearing aid are super sensitive to moisture. You have to be extra careful to not get them wet or expose them to high humidity areas. If you wear them working out, make sure you keep them dry always. The other con is that if you are like me, these are so lightweight, that I completely forgot I am wearing them at times. This can be bad because you may jump in the shower or go walking or working in the yard and forget you have them on and they get wet or moist. Other than that, these are the best hearing aids I have had and I really like them a lot."
12,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Absolutely worth the cost!,"I have been suffering from hearing loss for years and waiting on a good solution while awaiting assistance from the VA audiology clinic. Having the option and ability to purchase high quality hearing aids like the Lexie B2 powered by Bose over the counter is incredible! The second I put these one, I was able to hear things that I can't remember how long it's been since I had heard them last! Everything is crystal clear with incredible definition, especially in crowded environments! The rechargeable batteries hold a charge through the entire day, allowing you to hear everything you need throughout the working day and all the way to bed. Setup is very quick and intuitive, with a very easy to follow guided program to ensure you have the best fit and a comfortable use. The fit is very comfortable, not quite the same as some of the best earbuds, but so lightweight, you barely notice they're on your ears!

As someone in their early 30s with significant hearing loss, these have been life changing since receiving them a few weeks ago. I would definitely recommend these hearing aids to those looking for an excellent quality option that you don't need to wait years to receive. Absolutely amazing change in my life being able to actually hear again!"
12,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Very nice OTC hearing aids,"Having to wear hearing aids for many years I decided to try some Over The Counter hearing aids. I was looking for some similar to what I currently wear. The Lexie Hearing aids are what I found to try. I got these delivered and opened them up to find something very similar to my more expensive ones. They come with a charging case, although it must be plugged in in order to charge them back up. They will last over 12 hours depending on your environment.  There is an app you will need to download for adjusting you new hearing aids. They use Bluetooth to connect your phone. you can adjust the volume and set bass and treble. you can also set one ear high volume than the other if necessary. The box comes with extra ear tips and these are behind the ear. I had a little problem with the app in setting up an account, however it wasn't hard to do. I even got a call from Lexie to find out how I was doing with the new hearing aids. The only draw backs I found in these are they are not for streaming music or answering your phone. So if you are driving a car you will need some other type of hearing device to answer phone calls."
12,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Perfect set of hearing aids,"The features of these lexie bose hearing aids are similar to the any on the market. Don’t be scared away by the bose name because they work the same. The performance though to me is out of this world. If you are familiar with Bose products then you already have high expectations, as you should. It comes out of the box and ready to charge in the protection case. Just plug them up and let them charge for a couple of hours. After that take them out and make sure you find the plastic ear fitting that works best for your size ear. To me, there is a small and large, everything else is getting too complicated. You actually don’t need the app for these hearing aids to work. Just put them in your ear and press both the buttons. There will be a jingle in your ear and immediately you will hear everything. I even heard my hair wrestle over my ear, my breathing, things were heard from a couple rooms away. It felt super to hear so well but also a little annoying so find a level of sound that works for you. I suggest turn it down and turn up when needed. If the sound is too far up there will be a sharp ringing which means the hearing aids are too close and too loud.
Overall these are great."
12,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Very Happy,"I had a hearing test done and was diagnosed with a mild to moderately severe sloping hearing loss. After studying my audiogram and researching over the counter hearing aids I felt like I was borderline for OTC hearing aids. The hearing test was done by a major prescription hearing aid firm. After they worked their mumbo jumbo hoodoo magic special discount they wanted about $5800 to fix me up. I told them I would think about it.
What I thought was, it's worth a shot to try the over the counter route. Purchasing through Best Buy, I had 60 days to decide whether it would work or not.
I had a little trouble setting things up initially because I didn't realize the location feature had to be on on my cell phone. Customer service was of very little help when I called. When the tech couldn't resolve the problem after about 30 minutes he said he would have to get back to me later. I finally figured it out myself before he called back several hours later. When he called he said he was still researching the problem. I told him what the problem was and suggested in the future that one of the first questions he should ask is do you have your location setting turned on.
After that was resolved things got better. I had no problem getting used to wearing them and the improvement in hearing was immediately noticeable! It took a few days of tweaking settings to find the sweet spot and I am still making occasional adjustments. The most immediate difference was in watching and listening to my St. Louis Cardinals ballgames. I was setting the TV volume at 26 -28 and still had difficulty understanding the broadcasters. Now I'm at 20 -22 and understanding most of what is being said. If only the ball team was better!
One on one conversations are much improved. Even conversations in noisy environments are much better. Those environments require more adjustment of settings and have to be tweaked depending on the environment. I like the app and the ability to save settings for specific environments. I like how easy it is to adjust volume if needed in different environments.
Occasionally, the app won't recognize the hearing aid. Closing it and reopening it usually pairs it up. Occasionally the volume turns down on its own for some unexplained reason. These are minor annoyances but can be dealt with. 
The one thing I find most annoying is noises caused by my cap, glasses, or hair rubbing against the behind the ear portion of the device. After about 3 weeks I ordered a pair of Eargo 6 in the ear devices. These came from Best Buy also and I was going to see which pair worked best and return the other. I was pleased that noises caused by my cap, glasses, or hair rubbing against the device were eliminated. I wanted those devices to work so much. No matter how much I worked with them and adjusted them they did not improve my hearing as much as the Lexie B2.  I wore them exclusively for about 3 weeks too and switched between the 2 for about a week. The Eargo 6 was returned to Best Buy.
Bottom line, if you have mild to moderate hearing loss, or as in my case mild to moderately severe in the right parameters, I would recommend the Lexie B2. They cost about 1/6 as much as the prescription device and are a good value for me."
12,BestBuy,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,App Difficult To Program.,It was very difficult to get the App to work with my IPhone. When the aids are charged removing them from the charger does not turn them on as with most. You have to press a button for 3 seconds and listen for a tone. I found that the sound presented with a background shrillness. They would also fall out of my ear on a regular basis.
12,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Great Hearing Aid,These hearing aids are great.  I have worn high grade professionally fitted and adjusted hearing aids which really did not not work as well as these.  No complaints.  Price was thousands less than my previous brand which needed constant checkers and updates by hearing professional which was a copay of my insurance plus every 2 to 3 years they were pushing for me to upgraded to newest made with thousands again out of my pocket.   Price is great and so much easier to budget.  Sound is really great in all environments.
12,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Amazing Tech in a Small Package!,"WOW! I had no idea these little powerhouses were so tiny. Hard to tell from pics. I was concerned about the fit of this design b/c I wear eyeglasses but the devices are virtually weightless and so unnoticeable, even with my short hair. I love the app. The hearing test and app make adjustment easy. I did have to adjust the bass a little from the test results. Nice to not have to contend w/a pushy person trying to sell overpriced hearing aids. Sound quality is different from natural hearing but you can get used to it. Same with the little parts that go into the ear canal. A bit uncomfortable but in time my ears will get used to them. You also must learn how to manoeuver these small instruments. I noticed a big difference with TV, the volume doesn't have to be set as loud now! Hope the hearing aids will help with presenters speaking over a mic in a big room. I got tired of hearing his/her voice but not being able to distinguish the words. So far very pleased!"
12,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Very Happy,"These are my first hearing aids. I did a lot of research comparing prescription aids and over the counter aids. I read the Consumer's Guide on hearing aids.  I also interviewed several people that have been using hearing aids for quite some time. What I learned is: no matter which choice you make i.e. over the counter/prescription, your hearing will not be the same as ""natural"" hearing. You have to take that to heart. Many of the people I interviewed with prescription aids had difficulty adjusting to their aids and getting satisfaction from their vendor. I could not see paying between $2000 and up for that experience. Had a little trouble 3 weeks in. Left aid stopped working. Called customer service and the person was not very helpful, knowledgeable or understandable. Several days later, I tried again. Customer Service was very busy so I left my number for them. It more that three hours for the call back. The person was VERY helpful and patient and was able to fix the problem(the aid was clogged with earwax) so this will be an ongoing issue most likely-but this will also happen with any kind of hearing aid. Over all I am quite satisfied with these. It is a definite life adjustment. They are pretty easy to use. I had not idea what I had been missing. The sound of my own footsteps, floor creaks, paper crinkle sounds. Was able to turn the television sound down over 30 points and can still understand speech."
12,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,better late than never,what can I say ??? except that I wish I purchased these 6 months ago...I've only had them for a few days but from the moment I put them in my ears and set them up I knew they were keepers...they do take a little while to adjust and personalize but once that's done they're great...it's wonderful not having to ask people to repeat things...
12,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Works great for me,"I have had these hearing aids for about three weeks, and so far I am pleased. You should know that I have hearing loss only in one ear so I only wear one hearing aid.  Sounds are generally richer and I can understand people on my bad side better.  I am still tweaking volume and tone settings for best results. My only complaint is that the hearing aids are best adjusted from the app and it is slow to pair."
12,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Fantastic!  Highly recommended!,"First off, I’m not affiliated with Lexie, Bose or Best Buy.  The Lexie/Bose B2s are much better than expected.  Within the first day I was wearing them without noticing they were there.  I wear reading glasses and no problem putting them on.  With my adjustments there are no feedback issues even when using the phone.  My hearing loss is moderate.  Sound quality is fantastic (as I expect for a Bose product).  User interface is simple and effective.  Battery life was great (15% left after 18 hours use).  The only negative is that it takes about 10 seconds to sync Bluetooth to either Pixel 5 Android or iPad (no big deal for me) to access settings."
12,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Wow!  Did you hear that?!,"As the Lexie B2 hearing aid comes out of the box, everything is packed nicely and the instructions are simple and easy to follow.  I currently use hearing aids purchased at a brick-and-mortar store that uses batteries, and thought these would be a nice change and a step up, especially the rechargeable feature.
  
The hearing aids as received out of the box kept falling out of my ears and I had to stick them into my ears over and over during the day.  To the point where it was irritating.  After reading the instruction booklet that came with them, it seemed like the receiver wire was just too short for me.  I called the customer service of the company and was told that the different size wires would be $10 for shipping and handling.  These adjustment needs should be included in the purchase price, not extra.  My current hearing aids receive free replacement parts, service and adjustments just by visiting the store and asking for it.
  
I did receive the new receiver wires after about 3 or 4 days in the mail and it was easy to replace them.  That sure did make them more comfortable and stayed in my ears much better.  My current hearing aids have an extra wire that comes from the ear bud that helps to tuck and hold the ear bud in place.  Adding this extra wire would be a design enhancement, I think.

The Lexie B2 Hearing Aids do have a large volume range for adjustment which allows one a bit more freedom in different settings.  How they amplify sound is amazing!  I can now hear my turn signal as it clicks on and off in the car.  When my cell phone rings, its twice as loud as before and I don’t miss as many calls or texts.  Just turning on a faucet and hearing the water run and splash is just amazing!  I forgot how much sound is out there to hear! 
 
The Lexie B2 Hearing Aids come with its own case for recharging, however, the case does not charge the hearing aids on its own, but rather has to be plugged into a USB port and an electrical plug was not included.  This is a bit of a drawback if you don’t have any USB plugs in your home, or a computer.  However, the charge does last all day and I have yet for them to need recharging during the day.
  
I am a hearing aid wearer for over 5 years, so know that cleaning them is always difficult because earwax is so sticky.  For my current hearing aids, I purchased a dehumidifier as an option which I use every night.   This makes the earwax dry and brittle and easy to remove just by brushing or knocking them against the palm of my hand.  Lexie B2 hearing aids do not make this option available.
 
As a longtime hearing aid wearer, I can honestly say the Lexie B2 hearing aids have given me better and clearer hearing than my current, and will be making the Lexie B2 hearing aids my go-to pair.  The other ones will get demoted to my backup pair."
12,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Lexie B2 OTC Hearing Aids Powered by Bose,"So I just received my Lexie B2 OTC Hearing Aids Powered by Bose a about a weeks ago and have been putting them through their paces. Now I have not been properly diagnosed with any type of hearing loss, though, I have known myself for awhile that my dominant ear is my right ear, which means there has to be some hearing loss in my left ear.

Upon opening the box, you will find:

* The Lexie B2 OTC Hearing Aids
* Charging Case
* USB-C Charging Cable
* Open/Closed Eartips
* Ear Measuring Tool
* Cleaning Tool

To get  started, it's best to ensure the hearing aids have been fully charged. This can take and upwards of 2 hours. Once fully charged, simply follow along by downloading the Lexie app from the App Store for iOS or Google Play Store for Android.

After fully charging the hearing aids in their case, I was ready to take these babies for a spin. Using your mobile device simply pair the hearing aids and you're ready to go. Power on the individual hearing aids by pressing the bottom button on the back of each hearing aid. It may be best to power these on after you have placed them in your ears, because you may get a loud screeching noise played back directly into your eardrums. The kind that if you're not deaf, you might be after that screeching noise.

Surprisingly though, once I got them seated inside my ears and turned down the TV, I was able to hear pretty darn clear versus what the TV level would need to be at for me to hear without the hearing aids in.
One thing that I would have like to see is the hearing aids being compatible to work with phone calls from my mobile device as well as music playback from my cellphone. If, that's something you're looking for in a pair of hearing aids, then these are not for you.

Overall, I think tweaking the app to make it a bit more user friendly in terms of controlling to volume individually for each hearing aid through the app instead of the buttons on the back of the hearing aids (to keep from getting that background screeching noise) might be better in the long run. Also making them able to be used for phone calls and music would be a nice touch. I mean imagine having these in and now you're getting a call but you can't use them to talk through on your phone or to listen to music. The only workaround might be is to place your call on speakerphone, but at this price, I'd say this is a feature that should have been implemented from the start.

If those few quirks don't bother you, then pick up a pair of these, I think you'll like them."
12,BestBuy,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Not worth the trouble,Too much echo and screwing around to get these set...I need the better quality hearing aids.
12,BestBuy,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Horrible background noise.,Nothing but background noise. Can’t hear the person right next to you for the background noises and sounds like pounding in your ear.
12,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,A great hearing tool from Bose/Lexie.,"As someone who's experienced mild Tinnitus I was super excited to try out this offering from Bose/Lexie. 

Pros:
These hearing aids are a lot more comfortable than I imagined. I should preface this with I've never actually worn hearing aids before, but they look uncomfortable. But I can proudly report the fit and feel of these was as good as the audio quality. 

What makes these really unique is that you can make adjustments to them using an app - everything from bass, treble, balance, directionality and environment. Compare this to traditional hearing aids and these kinds of adjustments can only be done by visiting an audiologist so you can quickly see the value prop in being able to make these adjustments on your own.

The hearing aids come nicely packaged and include a case, cleaning tool and different sizes for the ear piece. 

Cons:
The only con with these is that hey cannot be used for phone calls or music playback. The only thing I could think of is maybe they felt this would lead to more drainage and wear/tear on the battery.

TLDR summary: not a bad start for Bose/Lexie, but open up the functionality of future models for calls/music because there's non-hearing devices like AirPods Pros that can amplify audio AND allow for calls and music playback at a fraction of the price."
12,BestBuy,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,not good for someone who has been hard of hearing,horrid my husband couldnt hear a thing. just background noises were very loud but no voices..plates clattering..cars going by stuff like that
12,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Improve Quality of Life with Better Hearing,"Just for a little background.  I am in my mid-70s and have not had any medical testing for hearing loss.  I have, however, been told by others around me that I don’t seem to hear as well as I used to.  Situations were I have problems include listening to tv, conducting conversations in a crowded room, and hearing sounds like the coffee maker beeping.  With that in mind, I decided to try the Lexie B2 Hearing Aids Powered by Bose.  These hearings aids are small and rechargeable and can be controlled using Bluetooth technology with a phone app.

Setup was very easy and probably took around 5 minutes.  Just download the app, insert the hearing aids in your ears, and follow the steps in the app to adjust the sound level to your liking.  Adjustments can be found for whole room sound, sound from straight ahead, bass, treble, etc.

In operation, I did notice that tv listening was much more enjoyable and that I was now hearing every word.  Conversations with individuals were also much clearer and words were not being “clipped”.

I would recommended the Lexie B2 to anyone who feels that they are missing out on hearing everyday things correctly and would like to improve their quality of life."
12,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Better hearing restored,"I have moderate hearing loss around the speech frequencies in my right ear and have been using a pair of $6000 hearing aids for many years now.

I have to say these hearing aids are working so much better for me. I am hearing much better now. They are more comfortable and do not require battery replacement every few days as these hearing aids have rechargeable batteries. I have also noticed they do not require the daily cleaning my previous hearing aids require. For some reason there is much less wax buildup, maybe because they do not sit so far down the ear canal and the distance between the dome and the receiver element.

Upon arrival I charged them in their carrying case until the light remained steady. This took around 3 hours. I then downloaded the APP on both my Android phone and on my iPad. I created an account Lexi and the hearing aids paired with my phone via Bluetooth. There was a helpful guide on the APP to easily accomplish this. This was followed by an interactive tutorial.

The the APP is not complicated and it allows adjustment of volume and frequency ( bass and treble ) adjustments. I also set the volume higher on my right ear since that ear requires more assistance than the left ear. The app also lets you set directionality IE;360 degree or front facing. I find front facing works best in restaurants where I want the maximum hearing assistance towards my dinner mate and reducing noise from other areas. I also have the ability to set additional parameters based on a particular environment. I have set one up for TV viewing where I raise treble a bit more. Volume is easily adjusted by pressing a volume up or down button on either hearing aid that changes the level on both.

I have used the hearing aids upwards of 16 hours a day and still had 30 percent battery life remaining. The case that houses the hearing aids for charging does not have an internal battery like some ear pods that allow a charge if needed. I did not find this an issue since they last all day and get recharged every night.

One feature that is missing is the ability to stream music or phone conversations to the hearing aids. Maybe this has to do with battery life, but it is a miss for me. Having said that I have used my over the ear  Bose QC-45's and an on the ear  telephone headset without issue. There are times I get a quick squeal when placing them or removing them on my head. 

Included in the box are additional domes, a measuring device to measure you for the correct length of the receiver wire. Dome size number 2 is included and already attached. If size 1 or 3 is required you must contact Bose. Mine is fine with number 2. Also included is an extensive user manual, a hearing aid brush and a charging cable. 

My overall experience is a positive one so much so that my wife now wants a pair to replace her older very expensive hearing aids."
12,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Really help with voices in a crowded room,"For the past couple of years, my kids have been telling me that I need to have my hearing checked.  Of course, I just assumed it was teenager talk, after all, I do try to tune them out at times.  But I have noticed that I have struggled at times to understand what someone is saying while in a crowded room or anyplace else with a lot of background noise.  I still hear high frequency and seem to hear lows, but those middle frequencies, the ones most voices seem to fall into, were much harder to hear at times.  With all of that being said, I decided to try the Lexie hearing aids.  The version I chose were the Lexie B2 OTC.  Probably the main reason I chose this particular model was the fact that they are rechargeable.  I didn't want to have to full with changing batteries.  The one concern I had was how long the hearing aids would last on a charge.  The Lexie B2 have proven to be a good choice for my needs.  On full charge, the hearing aids have lasted well over a full day.  I have worn these for over 16 hours on a couple of occasions and they have still had plenty of battery left.  The hearing aids can be adjusted via the app, although, volume can be adjusted on the hearing aids themselves by a button on each unit.  The app connects to the hearing aids via blue tooth and allows several adjustments.  You can adjust the balance, volume, and level of treble or bass in order to cut through background noise.  You can set the hearing aids to pick up sound in front of you or all the way around you, and also comes with 4 environmental presets.  You can choose noisy indoor, outdoors, music and everyday.  You can also make adjustments and save them as personal presets.   The app also provides battery levels for each unit.  These hearing aids do not stream music or allow you to answer calls, so if those things are important to you, then you will have to look someplace else.  Overall, these have met my needs.  I don't have anything to compare them to except my normal hearing, and these do make a difference in what I am able to hear, especially in a crowd."
12,BestBuy,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Sony,Very poor quality you need to adjust it every time you use it
12,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Works like a charm,"Super impressive hearing aids. Easy to get started. Download the app. Charge your Lexie until the lights stay steady and NOT blinking. 
Check for the different size rubber like domes to see which one fits snuggly inside your ear canal. There are three sizes, 1,2 and 3. They come with size 2 done and size 2!wire by default. After trying the size 2 which it came with, switched to size 1 eventually as the opening to the canal is small. It still didn’t go in comfortably with the size 1 dome but that was fixed by ordering the size 1 wire. There’s a cutout indicating the size wire you need for your particular ear. Place the cutout around your ear while standing in the mirror or ask someone to assist you. Follow the instructions to determine the correct sized wire needed for your ear. If it’s size 1 or 3, it’ll need to be ordered. If you order within the 45 day window of registering your product, the wire will be free, but if you are past the 45 days, Lexie charges $100, not including shipping which is $18. 

I also called customer support to ask for help with the sound of and echo of my own voice. They were helpful in giving me instructions and their advice helped. Their advice was to increase the base to reduce the echo of my own voice. 

After the size 1 wire was installed, I heard a whistling sound which also subsided once I inserted the dome a little deeper. I’m order to get the done piece into the ear canal, I had to lift my earlobe to allow for a more rounded entry. 

The fit was good, the sound quality magnificent and now I can watch television at a much lower volume, hear someone from far away clearly without the need for them to yell or repeat. I can hear someone speaking to me with a soft and low voice from two rooms away. 

The cellphone you are using to Bluetooth the earpieces to need to be close to the hearing aids. It may not connect right away but keep trying over and over and it’ll kick in. I didn’t need to call for assistance. This seems to happen often when connecting many other devices, the first time around. Follow the prompts on the app to use the different settings. For instance, if you’re at a concert, you can select “front only” so the sounds from all around you don’t get picked up as much and you can focus on the sounds coming from the front of you, without a lot of interference from “other” room noises. Also, the open dome ear piece works better at deterring the whistling sounds. The advice for the echo of my own voice was to increase the base to 50 and lower it until the echo disappears. It worked. The whistling sound was resolved by entering the earpiece deeper into the canal but not too deep. It shouldn’t hurt to enter the ear piece into your canal. 

I love that you can’t tell from the front view that hearing aids are in use. Even the side view is mostly obscured. 

Each hearing aid can be increased/decreased in volume with the app or by pressing the bottom of the hearing aid, the grey plastic part that sits behind your ear. 

To shut the hearing aids manually, hold and press the bottom of the grey part of the hearing aid for 3 seconds. You should hear a tone. You may also lower/raise the volume using the app. 

You may also set the volume of each earpiece individually using the app. The App is user friendly. The App will notify you of the battery level. Putting the hearing aids in the little storage/charging station it came with, allows to charge it or just to store it. The hearing aids will attach to the perspective colored holding areas within the case. Blue is labeled Left, red is labeled Right. The wires are also labeled by color. 

I suggest washing your hands before inserting or handling the hearing aids and place a clean paper towel on a table right below where you are holding/handling them in case you drop it. 

Patience is needed to adapt to noises, comfort levels of wear, and just to be patient with the app. Ensuring your phone w/app is nearby the hearing aids to connect is very important. The hearing aid case stores them to protect them and also acts as the charge base. 

If you’re looking to enjoy listening to the jokes you’re missing at every gathering, to the sound of your grandchildren telling you they love you, to the concert and chatter at the office or at a party, then you need to get Lexie hearing aids by Bose. 

I highly recommend Lexie hearing aids."
12,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Lexie Hearing Aids OTC by Bose,"When I got these I was just a little leery of trying them out but I did once I saw how fast they charged up to full it too at the most 15 mins to full charge. They are very easy to set up once you get the app on your phone took tops on set up 5 mins and they were actually set up with the correct tips for my ears, compact case and light weight. So far I'm actually enjoying the clear sound from them and the ease of setting them up they are a lot easier than the prescription ones I have. You actually have control of the treble and base through the app which makes them 100% better sounding. The only Con that I have found is the fact of them not being able to use them as a cross type hearing aid which for those who never have had hearing aids one side is a mic which sends the sound to the other ear to make it sound like you actually have both ears to hear from one side to the other. But that would be for someone that is totally deaf in one ear. Cleaning them is easy as pie you just take the tip off use an alcohol swab wipe them down and done they do have filters like the prescription ones which should be replaced from time to time which were not included and they actually came with a small book in all languages for instructions which is helpful. All in all I would give these hearing aids a 100% and recommend them for anyone who has any hearing loss that is mild  also would recommend them for a friend"
12,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Good controls within the app,"Once these are in, they fit securely on top of your ear - it actually sits more on top of your ear than behind it, probably to aid the mic in picking up sound - but it can require a bit of dexterity to maneuver the tip of the plug into your ear canal. For someone who is starting to lose some of that manual dexterity, it can be a little difficult. Once in, the wire is not very visible. Unless you knew to look for them, they're probably not noticeable at all, at first glance. There can be quite a bit of noise from touching the main body of the hearing aid while getting it into position, but once there, it doesn't move around at all, so unless you specifically touch it for some reason, it won't pick up any contact noise. While it does have buttons on the back for adjusting the volume and powering on and off, you're better off using the app. There are controls to adjust overall volume and whether to pick up sounds mostly from the front or from all around. You can also adjust a single slider that can bias the sound more towards treble or bass. There is also a nice feature in the app that lets you basically create four preset control configurations, depending on the environments you commonly find yourself in. You can use the preset configurations for those environments or tailor them to your liking. It is also not that difficult to change the bluetooth pairing from one phone to another or to clear out the pairing history. It does come with three different sizes of ear tips, but if you need a different length of wire, you have to order that. Easy setup and easy to use controls make this a solid choice."
12,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Good sound but the app needs work.,Decent sound but bugs during setup made it difficult to use at first. The hearing aids are of good quality but during setup they lost connection and one of them wouldn’t make any sound. After resetting and restarting the setup process with the app I was able to get it working properly but I could see how some less tech oriented users might be frustrated.
12,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Good,"These are my first set of hearing aids so I don't have much to compare them with but I do like them. They seem to be priced in the mid range as some are cheaper and some are much more expensive. The Bose name is a definite plus in my opinion because of their reputation in quality speakers and audio equipment. I also have a few other Bose products which certainly support their reputation.

I have recently noticed my hearing isn't as good as it used to be though it seems to vary sometimes. I also have tinnitus which these don't directly address but they do help me hear other things better which seems to make the ringing from tinnitus less noticeable. I don't wear them all of the time but when I leave the house it's nice to wear them to help with conversations and generally hear what's going on around me. They are also great when watching tv so I don't have to turn it up so loud and disturb others. I occasionally play guitar and keyboards and they help with that too.

They are pretty tiny so keep them in their case when not wearing them or they may get lost easily. I like that they are rechargeable so you don't have to keep a pile of batteries around to be sure they'll work.  Usb recharge but mine didn't come with the adapter just a cable. I was afraid they might interfere with my glasses but they really don't. They are pretty comfortable once you get used to them. You can get longer or shorter wires for them if the ones that come with them don't fit. Has a measuring tool to see what length of wires you may need if the middle sized ones don't fit right. You can get one size free if you order within the time frame specified.

They seem more affordable than prescription hearing aids and the free app lets you choose from preset modes or you can create your own profiles and save them. The app is pretty simple to use and also adjusts volume, balance, and adjust for more bass or more treble but not both. It's a slider with treble at the top and bass at the bottom so it's more bassy or more treble.

I'm not sure if your insurance will help you with the purchase since there's no prescription so you may want to check on that. I personally hate going to the doctor and dealing with filling a prescription and possibly ending up with something I don't like and may not use. These I like and will use.

I wish they included the ability to listen to music from my phone or the ability to talk on the phone using the bluetooth but that would probably add to the price. The bluetooth is only for adjustments in the app (at least for now)."
12,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Hearing awesome,"I can hear the tv now with out full blast
Can’t even tell they are in very comfortable 
Only problem is now I can her my wife"
12,BestBuy,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,Hybrid Hearing Aids With Basic Set of Adjustment,"The Lexie B2s are a non prescription hybrid style hearing aid. Hybrid because they're a mix of the external hearing aids where the entire unit sits externally behind the ear and the style with an in-ear receiver. The expected benefits of this are noise isolation and better sound pickup and reproduction while maintaining a slim look. These are powered with rechargeable batteries which charge in the storage case. They're also Bluetooth enabled which is how you'll fine tune the hearing aids. Note, this does not let you listen to music or audio over Bluetooth, it is strictly a hearing aid.

In the box you get the B2 hearing aids, charging case and USB C cable, two additional sizes of domes beyond the ones pre-installed on the receiver and a cleaning brush. On the hearing aid body are volume controls, the microphone, and charging contacts. You power on and off the B2s by holding the volume down buttons for three seconds. Generally, you should be wearing the hearing aids before powering them on. The hearing aids will also turn off when placed in the case. They will magnetically latch in place which helps keep things from randomly falling out and let you have a tactile feel that things are place for charging.

Configuring the B2s is with a Bluetooth app. The hearing aids automatically enter pairing mode for a few minutes when powered on so connecting to them should be straightforward. The settings and tuning are relatively limited. Aside from volume, you can adjust bass and treble, left and right balance, directionally (whether to focus on sound all around you or in front). The app also has environmental settings which are pre-configured profiles of the settings I just mentioned. You can also create your own. Also, you can mute the hearing aids in the app.

The basic audio adjustment settings worked well and the B2s are functional as hearing aids. However, with Bluetooth functionality, I was expecting to be able to have more equalizer like control over frequency response which is not present. Also, there is no way to select between environments on the hearing aid itself. So if the user is someone who regularly uses android or IOS smartphones things are fine. If not, the user is stuck with just one environmental setting and can only adjust the hearing aid volume.

The app let's you check the battery level so you know when to charge. Otherwise, you just get a ""battery low"" spoken warning which doesn't give you that much advance warning. That said, the batteries are good for about a full day of use so as long as you ensure to always store them overnight in a plugged-in charging case, you should be fine."
12,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Much improved Hearing,"I’m very happy with these hearing aids given that I find them better than those my husband bought a few years ago for thousands more. The app is easy to use and I’m no tech person.
The fit in my ears is comfortable. I've been able to turn the tv volume down, hear conversations better & hear sounds outdoors that I missed. An audiologist recommended I get hearing aids 5 yrs ago. The small rechargeable case is great & the charge lasts easily 18 hours. None of the 4 settings drowns out background noises a lot, but I can still hear conversations much better than before. It wouldn’t be a deterrent to keep me from using them."
12,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,What a difference!,"WOW!  What a difference.   Of course I put them on before downloading the Lexie app.  The first thing I noticed was the video I was watching on my laptop was  too loud and i had  to turn it down.   Without  thinking  scratched my shoulder  and I could hear the noise of my nails on my skin.  Again without thinking I moved my glasses and that produced a loud noise.  Then I downloaded the Lexie app.  Easy to pair the hearing aids via Bluetooth.  I did follow the directions and  take them out of my ears  and plug them into the charging case which turns them off.  Then take  them out of the charging case and the paired right up with the app.  I used the app to adjust the volume.  Also you can use the app to set the environment.  There are four delivered environments Noisy Indoor like with the TV, Music,  Outdoors and Noisy Indoor like at a restaurant.  Based on the  environment selected the app will automatically adjust the volume and and treble (on the Outdoor setting).  You can also create up to 10 personal environments.  As I am writing this review I am hearing  the keys on my Mac clack as I type.  I've never heard this before, I always thought my Mac had ""quiet keys""!"

12,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Great purchase!,Grandfather loves them this far he just needs some adjustment in different environment but they have given him so much help!
12,BestBuy,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,Entry level hearing aid for minor hearing loss,"To start, I wanted to try the Lexie B2 OTC hearing aids as I have some hearing loss from being a drummer and DJ in my earlier years.  I'm constantly asking people to repeat themselves and have quite a bit of difficulty hearing conversation in noisy environments like bars and restaurants.  So - yes I was excited to try them out.

Right to the point - the Lexia B2 seem to be just an amplifier for your ear. It amplifies everything - perhaps too much.  As I'm typing this, I'm wearing the devices with my World Volume set to 18 of 100 set to an Everyday Listening environment, and the clicking of my keyboard is quite loud.  Rustling of papers or a paper chip bag is nearly unbearable.

On the PLUS side, I wore the devices for nearly a whole day before I told my family members I was wearing them.  Either they don't look at me very closely, or they are hidden very well.  I prefer to think the latter is the true.  Battery life is also good - I can easily wear them a whole day 8+ hours without draining them completely.  In addition, they are very light and comfortable - so much so that I almost forget that I'm wearing them.  The Lexie app is also quite functional when it works.

On the CONS side, I was quite disappointed that the Lexia B2's don't function as bluetooth streaming devices for audio or phone calls.  I would have thought that would be a very common feature to build in - maybe the B3's will have them.  Also, the Lexie B2's did come with a new case for charging them in, but it's just a case - they didn't build in a battery for charging them.  Most earbuds and devices come with a rechargable case vs just a carrying case.  My last con is about connecting to the Lexie app.  I'd say my devices connect about 50% of the time.  I power them on and place them on/in my ears, then launch the Lexie app.  My phone is within 2 feet of the devices, but it cannot connect.  I either have to try to restart the devices or place them back in the case - then try again.

Overall, the Lexie B2 OTC Hearing Aids Powered by Bose work well as a sound amplifier, but I personally expected something with the Bose name to be much more function, refined and feature rich."

12,BestBuy,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,NO CONNECTION TO APP,They do not connect up with the app used go monitor them so all that money spent is wasted
12,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,"Easy to use, but lacking a few features.","These are not my first hearing aids, but they are my first since they've been availavle over the counter. I was worried they wouldn't be high quality. Because they are partnered with Bose, i shouldn't have worried.

They are very easy to set up. For basic use, just take them out of the package and allow them to charge in the included case. I am able to get a full day's worth of use from a single charge. Its easy to drop them in the case while im sleeping and have a fresh chatge in the morning. My prior hearing aids required frequent battery changes, so this has been great. 

The appa isnt necessary, but it definitely extends the functionality of the hearing aids. As I really focus on speech, I appreciated being able to set the directionality to focus on partner conversations and not have to filter out background noise. 

They are very lightweight and almost invisible. You really have to look hard to see them in my ear. 

The one star i knocked off is the lack of connectivity to my phone. My prior set of hearing aids connected to my phone and allowed me to take calls through the hearing aid. These dont offer that feature, and i had some feedback while trying to wear these while talking on the phone."
12,BestBuy,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,Works as Intended,"In the box are the hearing aids, the charging case, a charging cord (USB to USB-C), very large instructional manual, quick start guide, additional ear adaptors and a cleaning brush.

First impression, I love the smaller charging case but there are no indicators on the exterior to know how much battery life is left or if the hearing aids are charging.

Out of the box, charge the hearing aids. I followed the quick start guide and attempted to connect the hearing aids to the Lexie app (the recommended app) on my phone and I had a hard time. I finally opened the instruction manual and it does state that if the hearing aids aren’t charged enough, they will not pair with the device. Another note, pair with the app and not the Bluetooth setting on the phone. If the aids are connected with the Bluetooth setting, they will not connect with the app. Another note, the charge case blinks when the hearing aids are charging and stops blinking and has a solid white light when they are fully charged. I plugged in the charge cord and after about 20-30 minutes, one aid was fully charged and the other was still blinking. I checked in an hour and both aids were fully charged.

I attempted to pair the aids again with the Lexie app and they paired right away. In the app, you can change the settings, i.e. the volume, the way the aids listen (front or everywhere), what type of setting you are in (outdoors, crowd). I used the aids first to watch tv since I tend to turn up the volume higher than normal to hear. The hearing aids worked pretty good, I was able to turn the tv way down and I had the aids about mid way on the volume with the direction set to everywhere. My daughter started talking to me and I could definitely hear her over the television which is good but when she was not talking to me, I could still hear her over the tv.

Keep in mind that there are no indicator lights on the aids, so when you take them out of the case, they do not automatically turn on but they do turn off when you place them in the charge case. When you take them out, you press the down button and listen for a sound which indicates they are on and in pairing mode. If the aids don’t connect to the app, go to your settings and make sure they aren’t paired to the phone Bluetooth setting. If they are, disconnect and the aids should reconnect with the app.

Overall, the hearing aids do work but keep in mind that they are simple and not super fancy and they work best with the Lexie app. Also, they do pair with the phone but they don’t work with the phone, meaning, you can’t make or listen to calls or music on your phone with your aids. If you have small ears and wear glasses, keep in mind that the aids are a little thick behind your ears, so it maybe bulky if you are wearing glasses, a mask and the aids all at once. My ears did get sore after wearing for over 4 hours with glasses and I also had to get used to the inserts as well. The inserts did make my ears itch a little on Day 1 and 2 but I am starting to get used to them now on Day 3.

I would recommend with high caution of what the hearing aids can actually do to friends and family."
12,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,I made a great choice.,"The hearing aids are excellent, and support is out of this universe.  
I had an old pair of Lucid hearing aids, and these perform every bit as good as those, except these work all day every day.  Nothing against Lucid.  My hearing aids had better days. 
Excellent for moderate hearing loss.  
when you open the box, you download the app (The Lexie app not the Bose Hearing aid app!!) They send the aids with #2 speaker wires.  Using the measuring tool they provide I decided the #2 wires were okay, I was wrong. The speaker kept coming out of my ear.  Using the video call feature in the app.  I sent them a picture of the tool on my ear.  She determined I needed the #3 wire. I had to pay $10 shipping for the $100 wires.  Video call on Thursday, wires in hand on Monday!  
Setup was a breeze and I love I can tinker with the settings without having to go back to an audiologist. 
Support is the best anywhere. Why? Wait times are less than 1 minute.  Support is from South Africa, but support is very easy to understand, and they have a charming accent, similar to UK or Australia.  Very knowledgeable and resolved issues every time. 
For me these are way easier than spending hours at the audiologist.   I made a very good decision at any price, but $1000, feels very good also."

12,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Enhanced hearing for grandma,Used for 2 weeks. It works great but definitely pricey
12,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Great Hearing Aids,Amazing hearing aids with a lot of functions and controls.
12,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Great hearing aid - app hard to use,They have definitely improved my hearing.  I can have normal conversations now.  They fit well and don't show.  The only issue I have is with the application.  It doesn't always connect to the hearing aids and I'm not sure I understand the whole setup.    The hearing ampification has been great for me and I'd recommend these.  Just beware that the application to control them requires some technical knowledge.
12,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,"Good hearing aids, customer support could be bette",These hearing aids are great. I can hear everything again. I didn’t even realize how much I was missing until I started to use these things. The only problem I had was that the included number 2 wires were too short for my ears. I called customer support several times and emailed to get the longer number 3 wires. I was told they were free and that I only had to pay $10 shipping. I paid the ten bucks and waited and waited. Finally after my 4th or 5th call they got it figured out. I received my new wires today and couldn’t be happier.
12,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Awesome,Great hearing aids. Much better than the other one we had.
12,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Nice and effective.,Quality product.  Tried another brand and was surprised how much more robust these were.  Mother in law thought she would like the “in ear” version but they hurt her.  These are better for her.
12,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Make a real difference in your life.,"Very impressed with my new hearing aids. And completely amazed with the company that makes them. While Best Buy sells them, they are no help with the use of them. Their people have no expertise with this product. But, Lexie has really got your back with their products. They have helped me use and fine tune their product right from the start. Well done."
12,BestBuy,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,Hearing aid,I have had a hard time getting them to work to my satisfaction.
12,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Lexi B2 Hearing Aides,These Lexi B2 hearing aids are awesome. They fit well and truthfully I didn’t realize how much I’ve been missing in conversations and everyday life. My only complaint is that it’s sometimes difficult to get the Bluetooth Lexi App to stay connected. That’s frustrating and I still find it difficult to have one on one conversation in a crowded place with a lot of backround noise. That being said I would purchase again
12,BestBuy,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,Hearing aids,"Nice design . Charger , but difficult to figure out ."
12,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Pleasantly surprised,Excellent to enhance your hearing. Very comfortable and hides behind your ear. So far it is making the quality of my life so much better.
12,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Clearer Hearing,"So far, so good. The sound quality is great. Love the fact that you can increase  the sound on the weaker ear and you can add direction."
12,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Lexie Hearing Aids work great!,"These hearing aids work very well, and are a good value. Easy to setup and use, but you need the app to get the most out of them. But, the app is easy to understand and setup as well. Great purchase."
12,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Lexie b2 hearing aids,Hearing is definitely much better. I use the app if I need to turn the volume up. Easy to use
12,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Good product!,"I bought this ""hearing aids"" for my wife.
Using this for a few months we can make conclusion that we bought wright product.
It works very well..."
12,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,A Good Alternative To A 4-Figure Set,"Nice fitting and not too expensive, but need time to play with them to get them synchronized."
12,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Lexie B2’s,"Very nice, so far. Has improved my hearing. Lexie technical support has checked in with me. Hoping to give them a better rating at the end of the 60 day trial period."
12,BestBuy,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,Not my cup of tea,"I've been wearing hearing aids for 10 years, A friend bought these and loves them so I thought I would try them. They would not stay in my ears and they did not have the settings  that I am used to. I ended up returning them. They may be fine for some but they just didn't satisfy my needs."
12,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Finally!!,So far excellent results with my Lexi B2 aids. I don’t get echo sounds and right now I feel I have my hearing back.
12,BestBuy,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,Lexie Hearing Aids are not compatible with Android,"I thought the hearing aids would be compatible with my Samsung Galaxy phone.  Unfortunately,  they can't ve used to answer calls or for streaming videos with an Android device. The Best Buy employee said they were Bluetooth . Employees at Lexie said they were only compatible with IPhones . That factor makes it difficult to adjust the hearing aids."
12,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,better,better we were going through batteries every day until we purchased the rechargeable set
12,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Seems good and hope it performs for me.,"Mid priced item purchased to begin the journey to better hearing, which seems to be occurring as I become accustomed to the aids.   Time will tell of the improvements I will make, so this review is a little premature, but my thoughts on the quality of the product is high and the interface with the app is also satisfactory.  
I truly hope a $1,000 purchase of an OTC hearing aid does the trick as I was quoted $7,000 from an audiologist brick and mortar after their testing, I’d hate to come up with the additional money so I’m hoping for good results long term."
12,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"Great value, top of the line OTC product",Phenomenal product. Bought them for my dad bc he wouldn’t go see an audiologist and kept delaying it. after a minute he was hooked. “You’ve changed my life”.
12,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,I can hear things I havent heard in years,"Great product. Very easy to setup and use.
I would recommend to anyone"
12,BestBuy,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Not worth the trouble to set-up,"Difficult to set up. They were whistling, hissing and just plain not worth the trouble. Going to a Dr. or audiologist is well worth the cost. They know what they're doing and set follow-up visits until hearing aids work perfectly. 
If Lexie had a onsite representative to help with set-up at an added cost it would be worth buying over the counterl."
12,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Terry Thompson,"The Lexi hearing aides are well worth the money that I paid. Everything was so easy to use. 
I would buy these hearing aides again, I am very happy with them . I would definitely recommend them to anyone"
12,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Recent purchase,Employee was very helpful in placing my order.  Two-day shipping was great.  I am well satisfied with my purchase.
12,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Great product and great service,I bought it for my grand mother. We had some trouble to tune it. But the technical service is great. They helped a lot and check the status with us very often.
12,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Lexie B2 review,"Lexie. Hearing aids are just as good as  the $5000 hearing aids that are being  replaced. Fast easy set up, and easy adjustment."
12,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Lexie B2 aids work great!,These hearing aids work well—just as described. The app makes it easy to adjust the volume.
12,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Great device,The hearing aid is light weight and charges in a timely manner and easy to use. Only had it for a few days so far.
12,BestBuy,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,Didn't work for us,Unfortunately these didn't work for my father in law. We tried a lot of settings but none worked. Lexi reached out several times to provide support so they seem to have great proactive customer service!
12,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Beautiful,I purchased this hearing aid for my dad. He loves them they bring his life back. I love it I'm happy with my purchase.
12,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Boserocks,Seems to be working well though I have a little fine tuning to do yet but a great investment
12,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Easiest rearing aids eer,I love the rechargeable batterries; I just put them on in the morning and take them off when I go to sleep. Noothing to it!
12,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,I made a great choice.,"The hearing aids are excellent, and support is out of this universe.  
I had an old pair of Lucid hearing aids, and these perform every bit as good as those, except these work all day every day.  Nothing against Lucid.  My hearing aids had better days. 
Excellent for moderate hearing loss.  
when you open the box, you download the app (The Lexie app not the Bose Hearing aid app!!) They send the aids with #2 speaker wires.  Using the measuring tool they provide I decided the #2 wires were okay, I was wrong. The speaker kept coming out of my ear.  Using the video call feature in the app.  I sent them a picture of the tool on my ear.  She determined I needed the #3 wire. I had to pay $10 shipping for the $100 wires.  Video call on Thursday, wires in hand on Monday!  
Setup was a breeze and I love I can tinker with the settings without having to go back to an audiologist. 
Support is the best anywhere. Why? Wait times are less than 1 minute.  Support is from South Africa, but support is very easy to understand, and they have a charming accent, similar to UK or Australia.  Very knowledgeable and resolved issues every time. 
For me these are way easier than spending hours at the audiologist.   I made a very good decision at any price, but $1000, feels very good also."
12,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,As Good as Prescription Hearing Aids,I paid $4000 for hearing aids and lost one. So these were a replacement. They are as effective as the prescription ones. They are easy to adjust.
12,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Bose II hearing aids,"So far, I like the product a lot. These will take time to adjust to, but the sound quality is a significant improvement over the amplifiers I had before."
12,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Works well,The only reason for a 4 was no noise cancellation. They work well because I have severe hearing loss in my left ear. These give me some hearing in that ear. I like them so far. Even will still work when away from phone
12,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Able to hear again!!,Very satisfied with this hearing aide. Excellent price and easy to use with app.
12,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Lexie b2 hearing aids,"Had tried some cheap hearing aids which just made everything louder and were super annoying when you talked .They just sounded completely unnatural so after much debating with myself about spending a thousand dollers let me just say they are completely worth every penny, they sound very natural and you can adjust them on the app so you hear what you were missing. I didn't realize the birds that i hadn't heard in 20 years, they are life changing."
12,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Hearing aids,They fit well and sound very clear. The Bluetooth connection is great.
12,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Excellent for most cases,I bought these for my dad - they worked very well for him except when he was in places with a lot of background noise (such as a bar). If he wasn’t in loud places as much we definitely would have kept them.
12,BestBuy,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,I dont recommend Best Buy or Lexie for anything.,Horrible experience with these hearing aids.They feed back off of everything.High pitch screeching all the time.No matter the volume set.Their app sucks.You have to shut them off and turn them back on to wake up wifi.My volume knob fell off within the first month and Lexie makes you pay return postage for any work that needs to be done.60 day return is a lie.You have only 14 days through Best Buy to return and they will fight you the whole way.I wouldnt recommend shopping peiod at Best Buy.I'm done with them
12,BestBuy,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,Bad app,"The app doesn't work most of the time, so not very good  when needing to adjust.  I do not recommend"
12,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Great hearing aides,"It took about a week to get used to, but after that everything was wonderful.  Sound quality is great, set up was easy, and charging is easy and convenient.  They are barely noticeable."
12,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,So far love Lexie Hearing Aids,"Service and delivery excellent.  Very impressd, so far, with these hearing aids.  Great customer service."
12,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Excellent value,Have worked really well for me after I made a change of rubber bells.
12,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Just want the giftcard.,They work great. Give me the giftcard now. Please.
12,BestBuy,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,Ehh,Ok for mild hearing loss I guess but anything more and not so good.One of mine stopped working after 31 days.I have mid to severe hearing loss and were pretty worthless to me.I returned them
12,BestBuy,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,Hearing aid,Hard to determine best setting.  There are no clear instructions to follow to improve hearing.
12,BestBuy,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,Nozz,"Too much feed back, and echos
Everytine I put them on I change the sitting, the siting button is in the wrong place."
12,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Satisfied customer,"Good price, easy to set up and use, my hearing is better but not great. At least now my friends aren't telling to get a hearing aid."
12,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Lexie otc,These have worked well and I am happy with my purchase. The app helps to make adjustments easy.
12,BestBuy,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Lexie hearing aids,"DONT BUY
Hearing aids work ok. Their warranty sucks I have my for 2 mo. And both wires went bad . They only warranty the wires for 35 days so I have to cough up $100 to get them to work. There is nothing in there info that indicates the 35 day warranty on the wires . If I could I would send them back but stuck with them."
12,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Bill,I purchased these to replace ones I have that were going bad and cost a lot more than these.So far these have exceeded my expectations and have more features than my old ones.I am very pleased with them.
12,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Lexie B2,I've had mine for a little under a year and have to return them to get fixed. Somehow the volume control button broke off and now they won't turn on. I also hear a lot of feed back in them when my ear gets to close to something
12,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Lexie B2 Hearing Aids,"Had trouble getting started but once I was able to pair them with my I phone, they fit well and can he adjusted easily."
12,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Lexie B2 OTC --Life-Changing for our family,"We have been needing to purchase hearing aids for my husband for a long time.  He was very reluctant.  The hearing aids were easy to set up and to learn how to operate.  They are not visible to most people.  He learned quickly how to put them in even though he has never used any type of ear bud before.  He does have difficulty adjusting the volume when the ear buds are in his ear because of the size of the buttons and their location, but the app is easy for him to navigate.  They have made a significant difference in our lives.  He can now hear me and others in a normal conversational tone in person and on the phone.  The one thing we have not been able to fine tune is hearing what is being said on TV, but it is better.  Rather than turning it up to volume 30+  we know can watch TV at volume 15- 17 which is closer to my comfort zone of 11 - 13.    The team at Lexie has contacted us by phone and email several times so support is amazing and was unexpected with this purchase.  I would recommend them to anyone."
12,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Dr,"Equal and in someway  better than one prescribed by my ENT
Battery lasts longer"
12,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Very good hearing aids,Overall these have been a very good product. Lexie is having some issues with the hearing aids staying synced to your telephone but they are working on those issues. Hearing is very clear. These are lightweight and you don't know that you're wearing them. Definitely great value for the price. And I love that they're rechargeable and I don't have to deal with batteries.
12,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Great Hearing Aids,I love them.  Better than the one hearing aid I paid $3200 for.  Love that I can control from my phone and support is great
12,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Lexie Listening Device,Comfortable.  Good sound.  Able to adjust.  Sure of not losing them.
12,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Lexie hearing aids,"Overall, I think they are a good value.better than paying $5,000 for a pair"
12,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,You get what you pay for.,"Good product, works as described. Setup was ok, As good as much more costly devices."
12,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Bose hearing aids,Hear aids are very good. They work well with the app for adjusting. The only thing missing is the ability to adjust the hearing aids separately. My hearing is different  on each ear. So far I am sastified with them.
12,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"Solid design, after setup no app required","Go these for may dad.  He had very expensive prescription hearings aids.  One was lost.  Had to use a DR to get anything tuned.
These are supper simple.  No earbud options etc. I just used an app on my phone, because my dad doesn't do internet. Got the sound the way he liked it and left it.  It has other options to adjust the sound field if the user has a smart phone, but they work wonderfully without the app after setup.  And he says the sound is much better than the old hearing aids that cost him twice as much."
12,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Hearing aids,Fit is good. My first pair that I have worn over A week
12,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Good quality but too tiny for elderly people,"The hearing aids are very good however has too tiny buttons for elderly people, recommended for ones who are familiar with technology, apps and smartphones"
12,BestBuy,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,Considering return,"Lexie service not so great.  If you need the longer wires, there's a number to call or a web address.  Both are sales, not support.  You have to wait on the phone or on a chat on line to get support.  And then they take 4-6 biz days to send the wires, so there goes part of your trial period."
12,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Mrs,"I don’t know anything about a promotion. I do love this product, I can hear things so much better."
12,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Works good for hearing.,Shipped fast and works good for hearing. Knocked one star due to having to pair with the iPhone over again multiple times. Doesn’t seem to stay paired while charging.
12,BestBuy,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,Lexie B2 OTC Hearing Aids,"I purchased  the Lexie B2 OTC Hearing Aids hoping I could avoid the process of going to the doctor and having my hearing tested. I know I have hearing loss and was hopeful after doing a lot of research that these would be the best fit for me. After putting them in and getting them adjusted, they seemed to have a considerable amount of background noise. With some more adjusting it seemed to diminish.  I felt an almost constant itching in my ear. I'm not saying that these hearing aids won't work for anyone, they just wasn't a good fit for me."
12,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Great hearing aids,There great a buy so happy I got them and a lot less expense than the last pair
12,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Lexie Hearing Aids,"Great product. Better than other OTC hearing aids by far.
They stay charged almost 20 hour's."
12,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,"Good, but some work required","Purchased directly from Best Buy approximately one month ago.  Delivery within a few days, no problems.
My hearing issues are mild loss in one ear, moderate in the other, difficulty in understanding TV dialog and hearing high pitched sounds.  

Have been experimenting with settings and finally have arrived at best for me.
Good features - Easy to use after loading app and pairing on Blue Tooth.  Note, if paired with more than one device (i-phone & i-pad) it may try to go to the last one used, not the closest one.  Keep the devices separated!  

I don't use them for phone use, and was surprised when I got a cell phone call while using my app to adjust the hearing aids.  The in-coming call immediately switched to the hearing aid and cut off the phone reception which I had just handed to my wife.  Took a few minutes to figure out what happened.  

Good battery life and easy to recharge.

My recommended approach to adjustments:  Turn the volume up and adjust the balance first.  Once you find your personal balance, use it for all other settings.  For me it was 33 Left.
After setting balance, work with volume.  Ended up going higher than I would have anticipated (70 for tv watching)

Then play with Bass/Treble.  Too much treble gives lots of noise and feedback.  I would have liked a frequency setting for high pitched sounds.  Even though I have a high frequency problem, a Bass setting of 10 seems to work best at higher volumes.

So far all my tries worked best with 'Front' rather than 'Everwhere' so I have standardized on Front.  'Everywhere' picks up lots of strange noises.

Suggestion for those trying different settings:  Adjust for a possible combination of settings and save it as an 'environment'   Then you can easily go back and forth between setting combinations to see what is best for you.

Overall - Not quite as good as I was hoping, but definitely an improvement - I can now follow the plot on tv shows, even British ones on PBS!  

Suggestion to Lexie - User's Manual spends more time on how to stick it in your ear, than how to fine-tune your adjustments."
12,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Great OTC hearing aid.,I bought these for my mom when her hearing aids suddenly stopped working. They were easy to set up. I put them on to make adjustments. The sound was clear and crisp what you would expect from Bose. I don't have hearing lost. They do not work that well for her because her loss is so great. But for someone with mild to moderate hearing loss I think they are great. The only thing I find annoying is that they slipped out of her ears easily.
12,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Good,"Good sound, comfortable, nice charging case.
More feedback noise than others, do not turn on automatically when removed from Case.
Most expensive ones I tried."
12,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Great Quality!,"I only give it a four star, because the phone app does not stay connect for long.  You can manually adjust the sound but you need to the app to make other adjustments.  Other then that, Bose really did an excellent job on these hearing aids."
12,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Lexie were the preferred type,"I bought 3 different types of hearing aids for my mother-in-law. Once she tried the Lexie, she was done. They fit, are easily adjustable and she loves having it on her phone. The case and recharging is something she is able to manage herself and we are grateful for it. She is 90 and is more and more depend on others and she wants to be independent. We will be getting the extenders next."
12,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,I Can Hear Clearly Now,Excellent product. Easy to understand directions.  Comfortable to wear. Sound quality very good. No echo distraction. I would recommend this product.
12,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Lexie B2 is an Awesome OTC Hearing Aid,"I have tried several OTC aids. A cheaper one that did not work well at all.  One that ran about $2500 and this.  The Lexie performs the best for me.  First the Lexie is excellent quality and works great.  
 The hearing aid's case goes about a week without needing a recharge.  This was a real concern with the $2500 Eargo.  It required recharging daily which has to impact its longevity.  
So, in short the Lexie B2 works well, has super quality and appears like it will last a long time."
12,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,mr tim,i started out with phonak top of the line hearing aids from the military these are not bad back ups when compared to 6000 dollar hearing aids the sound quality is good when you wear hearing aids every day you can tell a quality product i like these
12,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Probably the best over the counter hearing aids,"These work pretty well for me, and they might work well for you too. It really just depends, since everyone is different.

They aren't as good as those $3,000-$4,000 custom fitted hearing aids fitted by trained audiologists, but they are just a fraction of the price. And that is important for senior citizens on fixed incomes since Medicare doesn't cover hearing aids.

If you follow their instructions you can do a fairly good job making the best settings for yourself. They won't be as good as the more expensive premium ones, but they will improve your hearing experience a lot.

The pluses are they are affordable, and they do work, and this particular one is rechargeable, so you won't need to constantly buy batteries. And once you use them you will never go back, because you really can hear a lot more.

The minuses are that they will not stream bluetooth like most premium hearing aids will. This means you cannot stream your TV or your phone directly to your hearing aids.  Lexie says they are ""bluetooth capable"" but that means they will work with their phone app for controlling settings.  This is because their bluetooth is bluetooth LE, a low powered version of bluetooth.

One more thing.... they only come with Number 2 receiver leads, but if you need one shorter or longer, Lexie will send them to you for free during the 45 day trial period.  I needed Number 3 leads, so I called them and they sent them to me within a week. Their customer service seems excellent to me.

I really wonder why these things even cost $999, much less $3,000 or $4,000, because they are just a tiny bit of plastic with some electronics in it. I suppose the cost of R&D must be very high, because the materials themselves cannot cost more than what you find in $100 audio earpods. It just seems odd that something so small and made from cheap materials should cost more than a flagship phone, a 65"" TV, or a premium laptop!

But that is what they cost, and most of the people who need these things are elderly like me, so you just want to hear better for the time you have left."
12,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,OTC vs prescription $$hearing aides,The size is fantastic? Significantly smaller than my old pair that coat 4 times as much. I gave it 4 stars because my left ear disconnects occasionally. The rechargeable batteries are a great improvement over having to buy and replace batteries every few days.
12,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Worth every penny,These hearing aids are the best out there for the price. They are small and the battery lasts all day. They have different settings for every type of surroundings.
12,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Lexie 2 Plus,So far very pleased with product. App was easy to download and use. Right hearing aid I can keep in all day but my left one I need to remove after ten hours because my left canal is smaller diameter inside. Trying different rubber cones till get correct setup. Still experimenting with settings when out in public. So many different options on how you hear if you want. I would recommend to anyone without major hearing loss.
12,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Great Device,"Pros: The device is excelent,  many features, good battery, long last all day. Exceptional sound quality.
Cons: The receiver wire is too short. The charging case cannot charge the device without being plugged in."
12,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Great earbuds,"I ve had apple (all of them), and definitely the difference is noticiable,  only negative is when talking outdoors with wind, not the best."
12,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Glad that I bought these,"I am so glad that I bought these. I have needed hearing aids for more than five years. The price of audiologist-supplied aids and concern about sizing held me back, but once over-the-counter hearing aids became available, I felt that I had to give them a try. After doing some research, I chose these Lexies.  Setup was easy (and I am not the Queen of Tech), the sizing was good for my ears (there are different sizes of wires and in-ear plugs), and there are some basic pre-established settings that are easy to change. You can also add a number of customized settings. The price is at the high end of over-the-counter prices, but I thinks that these hearing aids are worth it. My only complaint thus far is that the wait time for Lexie tech support are fairly long."
12,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,These are awesome!,"They work well for the price. It is taking a bit to get used to them & making sure the cone is in my ear canal & staying there. Otherwise, I'm very happy with them! I have tinnitus (ringing in my right ear) and these help me hear even with that condition.  I wear glasses and I barely notice the hearing aids there. Definitely worth the $!"
12,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Nana’s hearing better now!,"Though it took about a week to receive, I have read the easy to follow instructions, and I have spoken with a service rep at Lexie to clarify something I read. I love these hearing aids. So comfortable and easy, with the App to adjust. Why did I wait so long?"
12,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Hering aideS,I rate them excellent. I hear better then I did with my prescription aids. It is wonderfull to have my wife not complaining about the tv being too loud. I hear things I have not heard in years.They charge up faily fast ( about) 3 1/2 hous with no problems. Thank You Best buy!!

The connection once disconnected can be reconnected by placing the the hearing aids back in the case then placing back on again.  The blue tooth connection also creates a cracking noise when listening to music or audio from a cell phone.  I am not sure if this is with all cell phones or just apple.
As for the hearing aids,  they perform well and allow for customization of tonal quality and direction."
12,BestBuy,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,"Great Product, One huge design mistake!","Overall excellent hearing aid except for one inexcusable design mistake.  Why on earth would you engineer a hearing aid where an elderly person has ""turn on"" the hearing aid by locating and pushing a microscopic button on the device after removing them from the charger?  When the hearing aids are inserted into the charger they are turned off automatically for charging.  Why not turn them on automatically when they are removed from the charger?   This is one of the simplest yet most egregious design mistakes I've seen in my 40 years of manufacturing consumer electronics. Wake up people.  Who do you think the target consumers of your product are?   Disappointing."
12,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,I made a great choice.,"The hearing aids are excellent, and support is out of this universe.  
I had an old pair of Lucid hearing aids, and these perform every bit as good as those, except these work all day every day.  Nothing against Lucid.  My hearing aids had better days. 
Excellent for moderate hearing loss.  
when you open the box, you download the app (The Lexie app not the Bose Hearing aid app!!) They send the aids with #2 speaker wires.  Using the measuring tool they provide I decided the #2 wires were okay, I was wrong. The speaker kept coming out of my ear.  Using the video call feature in the app.  I sent them a picture of the tool on my ear.  She determined I needed the #3 wire. I had to pay $10 shipping for the $100 wires.  Video call on Thursday, wires in hand on Monday!  
Setup was a breeze and I love I can tinker with the settings without having to go back to an audiologist. 
Support is the best anywhere. Why? Wait times are less than 1 minute.  Support is from South Africa, but support is very easy to understand, and they have a charming accent, similar to UK or Australia.  Very knowledgeable and resolved issues every time. 
For me these are way easier than spending hours at the audiologist.   I made a very good decision at any price, but $1000, feels very good also."

5,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,A Great Choice for Affordable Hearing Improvement,"With the new change to prescription hearing aids, there are a lot of options becoming available to the consumers. I have to say the Jabra Enhance Select is definitely the best that I have tried so far.

One of the best things about the Jabra Enhance hearing aids is that they are over-the-counter (OTC). This means that you can purchase them without a prescription from an audiologist. This makes them easily available to anyone.

The Jabra Enhance hearing aids are also very easy to use. They come with a comprehensive instruction manual and a user-friendly app. The app allows you to customize the hearing aids to your specific needs and preferences, such as adjusting the volume, switching between different listening modes, and creating personalized sound profiles. Using the app was super simple and easy to use.

The Jabra Enhance hearing aids offer excellent sound quality. They use digital amplification technology to prioritize speech for clarity and reduce background noise. I was able to clearly hear conversations from anywhere in the room.

In addition to their excellent sound quality, the Jabra Enhance hearing aids are also very comfortable to wear. They are small and lightweight, and they come with a variety of ear tips which is great since I've always have trouble fitting earbuds properly.

They also have a built-in tinnitus masker, which can help to reduce the ringing or buzzing sound in your ears.

Overall, I am very happy with my new hearing aids. It will be a major improvement to my life."
5,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Definitely helps alleviate hearing issues,"I will start off by saying my hearing is limited but not severe - my eustachian tubes are restricted so I'll oftentimes will experience muffled sounds so boosting any auditory input with the Jabra Enhance Select 50R is surprisingly effective at clearing things up. If it helps to clarify a little more on my level of hearing loss, I struggle to hear softer softs and have a particularly difficult time locating the direction from which tinny sounds originate from - think something along the lines of the hearing tests at the DMV (I fail 100% of the time) or the pinging noises to locate Apple AirPods or even an AirTag.  

I think it's important to note that this device utilizes ""wide dynamic range compression"" (WDRC), which compresses a wide range of sound levels rather just limiting loud noises or whatnot.  My understanding is that it takes in the full range of sounds and compresses into a range that the user can hear them all instead of just limiting specific range of sounds.  Hearing aids (or any microphone, really) have directional preferences when it comes to audio inputs.  The Jabras use hypercardioid microphones , which generally doesn't do great with picking up sounds from sources from the rear and sides; they are much better utilized for sounds coming from the front (unidirectionally optimized), which makes more sense for conversations and watching TV. 

I'm using iOS17 and the Jabra Enhance Pro app and it works as one would expect; I'd say it's pretty simple to get set up and follow prompts for ensuring a good fit and customized sounds.  If this is being purchased for someone elderly or just a person without a basic understanding of standard tech, some assistance is definitely required.  The Enhance Pro App has a surprisingly decent amount of customization and setting features - equalizer adjustments, location of lost/misplaced hearing aids, tinnitus manager...the settings are sufficient to adapt to your personal level of hearing loss.  Mine being ""minimal"" compared to most users, it didn't require TOO much from a modification perspective but it definitely helped.  I believe the app also allows to get technical help remotely, which is a good back up for those who can't troubleshoot on their own.  

The battery is solid - I've been recharging them at night on my nightstand but the product is rated for like 30 hours on a single charge, which is absolutely insane.  The box comes with a USB-C charging cable so it's not anything proprietary to be able to get the recharging dock set up.  Other items in the box includes a MASSIVE assortment of silicone plugs to ensure a comfortable seal, a cleaning brush/cloth, wax guards, and some various documentation to help get things started.  I've been taking phone calls and listening to music with these too but I don't really know what the battery life is if I did both for extended periods of time.  I think I'll have a better idea during a long plane ride.  

I got the grey color as it's small enough to be inconspicuous but large enough to look awkward in the beige color.  I'd rather it be clear that I'm wearing a hearing aid than people assume I have an odd growth behind my ear - but that's just a personal preference.  It's an over-ear fit and it's honestly pretty dang comfortable. 

MOST importantly!! There's a 3-year warranty on these guys with a 3-year loss and damage coverage.  For something so small and being used regularly, this is a great insurance plan."
5,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Truly an OTC replacement for my prescription aids,"I have worn hearing aids for around 4 years now. I tried a couple of the over-the-counter hearing aids from the warehouse clubs before buying the expensive hearing aids from an audiologist. The over-the-counter (OTC) aids that I tried were no help for my hearing loss. My main complaint was and still is understanding others in a conversation in a noisy room. After years of adjustments and knowing others that wear hearing aids, I have come to understand that while hearing aids can help, nothing will completely remedy the noisy room. Since the FTC changed the rules for OTC hearing aids, I have tried several of the new generation OTC hearing aids. The other new generation aids did not seem to help my particular hearing loss either. I wasn't sure if the aids themselves were not capable or perhaps if the online hearing tests were lacking. 

The Jabra-Enhance Select 50R Medical Grade Hearing Aid is the first OTC hearing aid that for my hearing loss is a suitable replacement for my audiologist supplied hearing aids. The setup was quick and easy. The app has All Around (average situations), Restaurants, Music and Outdoor settings. Within each major setting there are options for things such as emphasizing speech clarity, noise filter... There is also a graphic equalizer, allowing you to customize each setting.  These hearing aids allow streaming of phone calls and music to the hearing aids which is a great improvement over my current aids. While Jabra has an online (or perhaps in-app) hearing test, they also allow you to e-mail an audiogram to them. My assumption was that a fairly recent audiogram from my audiologist had to be more accurate than a self-test. Included in the setup is a video meeting with an audiologist. During that meeting I was taken through setup, use and cleaning of the hearing aids. The audiologist also adjusted my hearing aids to the specs that the audiogram that I previously sent to her. We scheduled a video follow up which has not yet occurred. These hearing aids are able replace my expensive audiologist supplied hearing aids in every area so far.

5,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Jabra Enhance Select 50R Hearing Aid,"So far, the Jabra Enhance Select 50R Medical Grade/GN Hearing Group hearing aids are the best I have tried. The adjustability is awesome. Upon receiving my hearing aids, I charged them over night. The next evening, I downloaded the Jabra Enhance Select app. I tried to get the hearing aids to pair with my phone, but they would not. I quit for the evening and retried the next morning. While trying again and having no luck I received a call from customer service. They reminded me that I needed to set up an appointment for orientation and hearing test support. She the assisted me with getting the hearing aids to pair with my phone. After I completed the set up and took the hearing test, I tried to set the appointment. Appointments are 2 weeks out. So, I cannot include that process in this posting. I now have a working set of hearing aids; however, I cannot complete the fine tuning until after my appointment. I was able to get the volume level of hearing aids to a lower level thus cutting out the loud hissing. I then tried the 4 preset programs. Automatic, restaurant, outdoors and music.
Each hearing aid is color coded for the proper ear. The charging case is also color coded. A full charge is good for about 30 hours of listening. The Jabra Enhance Select 50R hearing aids can also be used to stream music and answer call from the phone. Unlike most other Over the counter hearing aids, these are adjustable to each ear. The kit comes complete with many earpiece ends, and varying sizes. There are also cleaning supplies and instructions to properly clean without damaging. 
After using the hearing aids for 2 days they quit pairing with the app, the hearing aids still worked fine I just could not connect with the app."
5,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"Coming from batteries, these are game changers!","I am my father’s primary tech caregiver. I got him battery operated hearing aids as his first pair and they work wonderfully, connecting with iPhone and giving him a new lease on life. The only thing was I couldn’t get him to wear them enough because he was always fumbling with very small batteries and only used them on special occasions due to that.

These are his first rechargeable pair and not only has the charging dock been a game changer for him, there are other features that he adores, which even amazed me, as a techie. 

First, in the box came tulip tips (think normal earbuds), open tips, and closed tips. With the latter two in different (tiny) sizes and plenty of backups. There were multiple cleaning tools and all of the accessories I would think I would ever need. Only thing that his other pair had that would’ve been nice in the package would’ve been different sized cords, the thin plastic tubes that connect the battery and circuitry to the actual buds that go in the canal. They are interchangeable, his other brand came with them, and these came with a measuring tool but requires you to contact Jabra directly to request a different length.

Thing that impressed me most was once paired with his iPhone, there was a triple click menu for volume, balance, listening options (music, restaurant, etc), and ambient noise (rainfall sounds—why?). The integration with iPhone was extremely impressive as an in-iOS software menu. 

Due to the ease of use and integration with iOS, I now have him wearing them every day. He listens to his radio stations with them in, he takes his phone calls with them in. They are like permanent AirPods. Highly, highly recommended."

Jabra - Enhance Select 50R Medical Grade Hearing Aid - With Virtual Audiology Care

I’m very impressed with the total package that Jabra provides with these hearing aids. The charger is solid and easy to use. The carrying case is nicely shaped and convenient for a pocket or purse. The wide range of tips for various ear sizes and open air or domed shapes make it easy to customize. I even found that one of my ears is smaller.

I used the app to customize my hearing experience with the ability to set the volume and equalization for each ear. I can choose from four built-in presets: all around, music, outdoor, and restaurant, as well as adjustments to those settings.

I did find a slight delay in accepting a phone call, but that’s more a Bluetooth issue than a negative for the aids, themselves. They do provide very clear call quality. 

What seals the deal for me is the included virtual audiology care provided by licensed hearing professionals. I found the service to be polite, professional, informative, very personable, and helpful. After I registered, the audiology specialist called to set up a Zoom appointment and had me send them a picture of my audiology work up from a recent hearing appointment. 

When I met with them over Zoom, they were able to remotely set my hearing aids using that info and my preferences from using the aids for a few days. That becomes the new default whenever I put them on. 

They were very thorough and made sure I understood how to use the app, the aids, and even how to care for them long term. They checked the measurements on the wires using the included tool and offered to send me different length wires if I thought that would improve the fit. Overall, a very satisfying experience!"
5,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Doug L,My previous hearing aids were a well known high end brand that were six years old and out of warranty and starting to have problems.

Jabra Enhance has delivered as promised. As with any change, there is a period of adjustment to the new normal, but in my case, that period has been relatively brief and easy. Another very attractive element in the Jabra Enhance business model is the superb value for money when compared to the traditional hearing aid industry. I really love the Bluetooth technology. When answering the phone the sound goes right in your ear. Also, you can vary the settings for whatever environment you're in. Still getting used to them, but I realize when I take them out, how much they really help me hear better. I love the product, the quality and the way that is has opened up a life for me. I can now hear my grandkids and conversations I was missing in noisy restaurant environments. I highly recommend the Enhance Select 50R Medical Grade hearing aids.

Jabra - Enhance Select 50R Medical Grade Hearing Aid - With Virtual Audiology Care

I’m very impressed with the total package that Jabra provides with these hearing aids. The charger is solid and easy to use. The carrying case is nicely shaped and convenient for a pocket or purse. The wide range of tips for various ear sizes and open air or domed shapes make it easy to customize. I even found that one of my ears is smaller.

I used the app to customize my hearing experience with the ability to set the volume and equalization for each ear. I can choose from four built-in presets: all around, music, outdoor, and restaurant, as well as adjustments to those settings.

I did find a slight delay in accepting a phone call, but that’s more a Bluetooth issue than a negative for the aids, themselves. They do provide very clear call quality. 

What seals the deal for me is the included virtual audiology care provided by licensed hearing professionals. I found the service to be polite, professional, informative, very personable, and helpful. After I registered, the audiology specialist called to set up a Zoom appointment and had me send them a picture of my audiology work up from a recent hearing appointment. 

When I met with them over Zoom, they were able to remotely set my hearing aids using that info and my preferences from using the aids for a few days. That becomes the new default whenever I put them on. 

They were very thorough and made sure I understood how to use the app, the aids, and even how to care for them long term. They checked the measurements on the wires using the included tool and offered to send me different length wires if I thought that would improve the fit. Overall, a very satisfying experience!"
5,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Doug L,My previous hearing aids were a well known high end brand that were six years old and out of warranty and starting to have problems. Rather than paying over $3000 out of pocket to replace them I bought these for one third the coast and I am very pleased with them and the service that comes with them.

Jabra Enhance has delivered as promised. As with any change, there is a period of adjustment to the new normal, but in my case, that period has been relatively brief and easy. Another very attractive element in the Jabra Enhance business model is the superb value for money when compared to the traditional hearing aid industry. I really love the Bluetooth technology. When answering the phone the sound goes right in your ear. Also, you can vary the settings for whatever environment you're in. Still getting used to them, but I realize when I take them out, how much they really help me hear better. I love the product, the quality and the way that is has opened up a life for me. I can now hear my grandkids and conversations I was missing in noisy restaurant environments. I highly recommend the Enhance Select 50R Medical Grade hearing aids.

5,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,A Great Choice for Affordable Hearing Improvement,"With the new change to prescription hearing aids, there are a lot of options becoming available to the consumers. I have to say the Jabra Enhance Select is definitely the best that I have tried so far.

One of the best things about the Jabra Enhance hearing aids is that they are over-the-counter (OTC). This means that you can purchase them without a prescription from an audiologist. This makes them easily available to anyone.

The Jabra Enhance hearing aids are also very easy to use. They come with a comprehensive instruction manual and a user-friendly app. The app allows you to customize the hearing aids to your specific needs and preferences, such as adjusting the volume, switching between different listening modes, and creating personalized sound profiles. Using the app was super simple and easy to use.

The Jabra Enhance hearing aids offer excellent sound quality. They use digital amplification technology to prioritize speech for clarity and reduce background noise. I was able to clearly hear conversations from anywhere in the room.

In addition to their excellent sound quality, the Jabra Enhance hearing aids are also very comfortable to wear. They are small and lightweight, and they come with a variety of ear tips which is great since I've always have trouble fitting earbuds properly.

They also have a built-in tinnitus masker, which can help to reduce the ringing or buzzing sound in your ears.

Overall, I am very happy with my new hearing aids. It will be a major improvement to my life."
5,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Definitely helps alleviate hearing issues,"I will start off by saying my hearing is limited but not severe - my eustachian tubes are restricted so I'll oftentimes will experience muffled sounds so boosting any auditory input with the Jabra Enhance Select 50R is surprisingly effective at clearing things up. If it helps to clarify a little more on my level of hearing loss, I struggle to hear softer softs and have a particularly difficult time locating the direction from which tinny sounds originate from - think something along the lines of the hearing tests at the DMV (I fail 100% of the time) or the pinging noises to locate Apple AirPods or even an AirTag.  

I think it's important to note that this device utilizes ""wide dynamic range compression"" (WDRC), which compresses a wide range of sound levels rather just limiting loud noises or whatnot.  My understanding is that it takes in the full range of sounds and compresses into a range that the user can hear them all instead of just limiting specific range of sounds.  Hearing aids (or any microphone, really) have directional preferences when it comes to audio inputs.  The Jabras use hypercardioid microphones , which generally doesn't do great with picking up sounds from sources from the rear and sides; they are much better utilized for sounds coming from the front (unidirectionally optimized), which makes more sense for conversations and watching TV. 

I'm using iOS17 and the Jabra Enhance Pro app and it works as one would expect; I'd say it's pretty simple to get set up and follow prompts for ensuring a good fit and customized sounds.  If this is being purchased for someone elderly or just a person without a basic understanding of standard tech, some assistance is definitely required.  The Enhance Pro App has a surprisingly decent amount of customization and setting features - equalizer adjustments, location of lost/misplaced hearing aids, tinnitus manager...the settings are sufficient to adapt to your personal level of hearing loss.  Mine being ""minimal"" compared to most users, it didn't require TOO much from a modification perspective but it definitely helped.  I believe the app also allows to get technical help remotely, which is a good back up for those who can't troubleshoot on their own.  

The battery is solid - I've been recharging them at night on my nightstand but the product is rated for like 30 hours on a single charge, which is absolutely insane.  The box comes with a USB-C charging cable so it's not anything proprietary to be able to get the recharging dock set up.  Other items in the box includes a MASSIVE assortment of silicone plugs to ensure a comfortable seal, a cleaning brush/cloth, wax guards, and some various documentation to help get things started.  I've been taking phone calls and listening to music with these too but I don't really know what the battery life is if I did both for extended periods of time.  I think I'll have a better idea during a long plane ride.  

I got the grey color as it's small enough to be inconspicuous but large enough to look awkward in the beige color.  I'd rather it be clear that I'm wearing a hearing aid than people assume I have an odd growth behind my ear - but that's just a personal preference.  It's an over-ear fit and it's honestly pretty dang comfortable. 

MOST importantly!! There's a 3-year warranty on these guys with a 3-year loss and damage coverage.  For something so small and being used regularly, this is a great insurance plan."
5,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Truly an OTC replacement for my prescription aids,"I have worn hearing aids for around 4 years now. I tried a couple of the over-the-counter hearing aids from the warehouse clubs before buying the expensive hearing aids from an audiologist. The over-the-counter (OTC) aids that I tried were no help for my hearing loss. My main complaint was and still is understanding others in a conversation in a noisy room. After years of adjustments and knowing others that wear hearing aids, I have come to understand that while hearing aids can help, nothing will completely remedy the noisy room. Since the FTC changed the rules for OTC hearing aids, I have tried several of the new generation OTC hearing aids. The other new generation aids did not seem to help my particular hearing loss either. I wasn't sure if the aids themselves were not capable or perhaps if the online hearing tests were lacking. 

The Jabra-Enhance Select 50R Medical Grade Hearing Aid is the first OTC hearing aid that for my hearing loss is a suitable replacement for my audiologist supplied hearing aids. The setup was quick and easy. The app has All Around (average situations), Restaurants, Music and Outdoor settings. Within each major setting there are options for things such as emphasizing speech clarity, noise filter... There is also a graphic equalizer, allowing you to customize each setting.  These hearing aids allow streaming of phone calls and music to the hearing aids which is a great improvement over my current aids. While Jabra has an online (or perhaps in-app) hearing test, they also allow you to e-mail an audiogram to them. My assumption was that a fairly recent audiogram from my audiologist had to be more accurate than a self-test. Included in the setup is a video meeting with an audiologist. During that meeting I was taken through setup, use and cleaning of the hearing aids. The audiologist also adjusted my hearing aids to the specs that the audiogram that I previously sent to her. We scheduled a video follow up which has not yet occurred. These hearing aids are able replace my expensive audiologist supplied hearing aids in every area so far. Three years of hearing care are included with the purchase of these aids. I love everything about these and have not used my prescription aids since getting these."
5,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Good hearing is easy now!,"The Jabra Enhance Select 50R Medical Grade Hearing Aids (to me they are a hybrid as you get hearing specialist assistance via internet or phone) are available over-the-counter (OTC), which means you don't need to go through a lengthy process to get them, like you would with prescription (office visit required) hearing aids.
Just a few of the great features that are beneficial to have in hearing aids like the Jabra Enhance Select 50R Medical Grade Hearing Aids are - Noise reduction that cleans up background noise to enhance speech clarity. Directional microphones that focus on sounds in front while reducing sounds from other directions. Feedback cancellation that minimizes whistling or feedback noise. Wireless connectivity that enables connection to smartphones, TVs, and other devices for direct audio streaming. Rechargeable batteries instead of replaceable non-rechargeable disposable batteries. Automatic programming that adjusts settings automatically based on the environment. Multiple programs/memory settings that offer different settings for various listening environments (e.g., noisy environments, music, outdoors etc.). Bluetooth compatibility that offers direct connectivity with smartphones and other Bluetooth-enabled devices. A smartphone app that allows you to adjust settings. Water and Dust resistance that protects the hearing aids from environmental damage.

To sum it all up the (Jabra Enhance Select 50R Medical Grade Hearing Aids and app) are easy  of use, have are easy to fit and feel great, their customer service helpfulness is fast and professional, and the quality of manufacturing is excellent."
5,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Jabra Enhance Select 50R Hearing Aid,"So far, the Jabra Enhance Select 50R Medical Grade/GN Hearing Group hearing aids are the best I have tried. The adjustability is awesome. Upon receiving my hearing aids, I charged them over night. The next evening, I downloaded the Jabra Enhance Select app. I tried to get the hearing aids to pair with my phone, but they would not. I quit for the evening and retried the next morning. While trying again and having no luck I received a call from customer service. They reminded me that I needed to set up an appointment for orientation and hearing test support. She the assisted me with getting the hearing aids to pair with my phone. After I completed the set up and took the hearing test, I tried to set the appointment. Appointments are 2 weeks out. So, I cannot include that process in this posting. I now have a working set of hearing aids; however, I cannot complete the fine tuning until after my appointment. I was able to get the volume level of hearing aids to a lower level thus cutting out the loud hissing. I then tried the 4 preset programs. Automatic, restaurant, outdoors and music.
Each hearing aid is color coded for the proper ear. The charging case is also color coded. A full charge is good for about 30 hours of listening. The Jabra Enhance Select 50R hearing aids can also be used to stream music and answer call from the phone. Unlike most other Over the counter hearing aids, these are adjustable to each ear. The kit comes complete with many earpiece ends, and varying sizes. There are also cleaning supplies and instructions to properly clean without damaging. 
After using the hearing aids for 2 days they quit pairing with the app, the hearing aids still worked fine I just could not connect with the app."

5,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Get Your Normal Life Back,"Hearing aids (I will refer to them as “HAs”) are a multi faceted topic as there are different degrees and types of hearing loss, there are differences in hardware, differences in support and after-care, and differences in the individual’s ability to manage proper use and care of the devices.

I first want to say I have been a prescription HA user for eleven years (two different sets of hardware from different manufacturers), and have also tested a couple other sets of OTC HAs, both of which have left me less than impressed. My hearing loss is at the upper end of moderate loss (per Jabra’s audiologist’s opinion) thus making me just barely a target customer for the JabraGN Enhance Select 50R product.

The Select 50R is at the lower end of JabraGN’s range of OTC products (there are also Select 100 and Select 200 versions). There is a Select 50 model that uses replaceable batteries rather than containing rechargeable batteries like the Select 50R, and the features of the 50R match up very similar to the Select 100, so I am not sure what Jabra’s end game is for a product line up. Virtually all HA manufacturers have a variety of models in their lineup at different price points and with differing feature sets. With my prescriptions aids, I have bought at the upper end of the offered lineups (my last set was $4,275 for the pair in 2019) as I didn’t want to leave anything on the table as far as the product’s ability to help me. That said, I have been slightly disappointed in the results and functionality, and sometimes wished I had bought a more basic set at a lower price.

Having worn HAs previously, it is inevitable that I make comparisons between them and these Jabra units (GN Group is the parent company of Jabra and ReSound is their prescription brand). The RITE (Receiver-In-The-Ear) design is a very comfortable to wear style, provides very good performance, and in my opinion is a good choice for most people. This design is very unobtrusive and most people don’t even notice you are wearing them. Obviously everyone’s ears are different, but having the aid behind the ear is not bothersome even if you wear glasses. 

The Jabra Enhance web site is very well laid out and easy to navigate. There are tools and advice to evaluate if your hearing loss can be helped by an OTC hearing device. Their OTC hearing aids come with a 100-day money-back trial period, which is very generous. I believe the trial period that manufacturers offer varies from state to state and is usually 30 or 45 days. Jabra also offers three years of follow-up care along with a three year warranty and three year loss & damage coverage (a deductible applies).

This is my first experience with rechargeable hearing aids and after using both kinds, I will definitely continue with rechargeable ones in the future. Using batteries, I normally get seven days of all-day use (about 16 hours per day) from a set of batteries (312 size) at about $1.12 per week. Rechargeable HAs cost more upfront, but the convenience is worth it in my opinion. These Enhance 50Rs just drop into the charging base and they are charged wirelessly, meaning there are no electrical contacts on the HAs or in the base to get dirty or corroded. They will recharge in about 3 hours and can last up to 30 hours before needing to be charged. I had one day where I forgot to set them in the charger and they went about 27 hours before one of them chimed and the phone app asked me to place them in the charger. On a normal day the charge level would drop from 100% to 70% with minimal use streaming audio content.

The Select 50R HAs are very slightly larger in size than my prescription ones that take replaceable batteries, have three microphone openings, one push button that is nicely sized with good tactile feedback, and one LED to show charging status (blinks when charging, solid green when fully charged). The receiver that fits in the ear canal has the option of four different lengths of wire to connect it to the HA. I’m not sure why the industry calls it a receiver when in actuality it is a tiny speaker that reproduces sound from the amplifier in the body of the HA. The HAs come with a number 2 wire in the package, but Jabra will supply another size if needed based on using a measuring tool that is supplied in the kit. After sending a picture of my ears with the tool in place to Jabra, I was quickly informed via email that another set of receivers would be shipped out to me and they arrived in just a few days. The receiver and attached wire are VERY easy to replace using the small tool that is supplied in the kit.

The starter kit that comes with the HAs includes three sizes of open domes (a dome is the little rubber piece that attaches to the receiver and holds it in the ear canal), three sizes of closed domes (a closed dome has no holes in it that allow outside noises into the ear), one package of tulip domes (they come in one size only), two packages of wax traps (little “filters” that keep ear wax out of the receivers), a cleaning brush, a cleaning cloth, a tool for opening the latch that holds the receiver wire to the HA body, a measuring tool to check the distance from the top of the ear to the ear canal, a sturdy, hard-sided carrying/storage case, and the charging base with USB cable and power adapter. The items included allow the user to get a perfect fit on their own without a visit to a hearing professional. Also included is plenty of paper documentation (thank you Jabra!) that is very well written at an easy to understand level. I can’t stress enough to read through the user guide completely before starting to use the HAs.

The initial consultation I have had with a Jabra audiologist was via a Zoom meeting. Over the years I have interacted face-to-face with seven or more different audiologists (I have had hearing tests as far back as 1983 even though I didn’t get HAs until 2012), and I must say that the audiologist from Jabra was better at explaining things, answering my questions, and making sure I was taken care of properly than the other ones were. She reviewed my last audiogram that I took a picture of and uploaded to Jabra and designed an amplification curve tailored to my specific hearing loss. The customization will carry over to each of the four built-in listening programs, “All-Around”, “Restaurant”, “Music”, and “Outdoor”. During our meeting, she downloaded the file to the Jabra Enhance app on my iPhone and it installed onto the Select 50R HAs in just a matter of a couple of minutes. The change in what I was hearing after the HAs rebooted was immediate and very noticeable. I have another Zoom meeting scheduled in a week for follow-up to make sure I am satisfied with the changes. Everything so far has been the same as what I have experienced in a physical audiologist’s office except for the hearing test in the soundproof booth. The Jabra web site/app does offer a hearing evaluation, but it is not as comprehensive or detailed as what you get in an actual office.

The buttons on the HAs themselves allows you to turn them on and off (independently), adjust the volume up and down (both at the same time), and change listening programs (both at the same time). The programs have different algorithms making them suitable for different environments that possess different challenges for hearing clearly. “All-Around” is the default program for normal use, “Restaurant” takes into account what can be a noisy environment with many conversations going on, “Music” adjusts to make streamed music or live music more natural sounding, and “Outdoor” helps to overcome wind noise. I did notice some distinct differences between the programs, but some possible improvements might be hard to ascertain depending on the individual user and the specific environment being encountered. Each program also has the ability to offer small changes such as “Noise Filter”, “Speech Clarity”, or individual bass and treble boost. The phone app also allows you to reach out to Jabra’s hearing professionals for help and has tutorials on how to do certain things such as clean the HAs. Jabra’s app is much better than the app from one of the major HA suppliers that made my prescription aids.

The big question is, have they been problem-free? To be honest, no, but I don’t think it is any worse than any other high-tech electronic device. And it is hard to say if the fault lies with the hardware, software in the HAs themselves, the phone app, or most likely in the connection between my iPhone and the HAs. I have had issues with not hearing phone notifications in both HAs at the same time (usually I do), sometimes when changing between the four built-in programs the HAs will not hold the last one chosen and will revert back to the previous one after a few seconds, when streaming audio from my phone occasionally the audio will cut out in one HA, and when first turned on (removing them from the charger) the right aid will start squealing slightly with feedback, but it will stop after a few minutes. Are any of these issues deal breakers? Absolutely not. Note that the hearing aids do NOT need the phone with the app present to work, it’s just that some of the features will not be available, but the basics such as changing volume and changing programs will be.

HAs require a certain amount of manual dexterity to manage them - cleaning, replacing domes and wax traps, using the phone app, etc. OTC HAs will probably end up being used by a somewhat younger demographic, and being served remotely rather than in a face-to-face encounter they will be better able to deal with not having the hands-on relationship with a local audiologist like an older person would. Anyone experiencing hearing loss and the perceived stigma that goes along with wearing hearing aids, please do yourself a favor and put those thoughts out of your mind. The JabraGN Enhance products are a great place to start and I guarantee you will wish you would have done it sooner."
5,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Great way to enhance hearing with very small aids,"I noticed I could hear much better after trying out the Enhance Select 50R, I should have tried them way before now, it is a big change. The speech clarity and noise reduction are amazing.   Jabra has made great products for a long time; I remember my first headset as well as my headphones and now Enhance Select 50.  The Jabra are easy to setup, basically just plug and play.   

Right out of the box, a QR Code is there to start, download the app and the app walks through all the necessary steps to get them to work well like how to measure my ears, how to wear them, charge them and more. In the box it even comes with cards with large numbers with the step by step instructions, and if any questions should come up, information is right there. 

The application is also easy to use to adjust or customize the aids right from the smarthphone.  
Being able to use them with Apple or Android cell phone is great and it does not have to be the most expensive phone, just a smartphone to download the app and customize the set. 

The aids are rechargeable, and they are easy to put them on the large case to charge them and the battery life lasts an entire day and perhaps longer. 

Taking phone calls and music or podcast streaming is available without taking them off, they are already paired via Bluetooth to the smartphone so it is so much easier to listen to every day occasions. 

The size is amazingly small, I remember people having large hearing aids when I was younger and now they are so small they are almost invisible, I really like that. 

The premium package comes with three years of follow up care so help is there if needed. 

Overall they are easy to setup, easy to use and maintain and I am very happy with the near invisible pair."

So, I was thrilled to have the opportunity to try these medical grade hearing aids from Jabra.

The Jabra Enhance Select 50R is a medical-grade, OTC hearing aid. It is programmable and even though there are a few shortcomings, the pros far outweigh the cons. In my experience, OTC hearing aids are simple amplifiers with preset modes. Jabra’s hearing aids are comparable to the prescription-only hearing aids I have. The Jabra Enhance hearing aids are designed for mild to moderate hearing loss. If you have profound hearing loss, a prescription hearing aid recommended instead of this OTC option. For reference, here are the mild and moderate hearing loss definitions from the CDC.

Mild Hearing Loss — a person with a mild hearing loss may hear some speech sounds but soft sounds are hard to hear.
Moderate Hearing Loss — a person with a moderate hearing loss may hear almost no speech when another person is talking at a normal level.
One of the biggest benefits of these OTC hearing aids is the inclusion of the virtual audiology support. Jabra offers this feature with their Premium Package support as an added cost, but it’s included with the Enhance 50R. Despite having some limitations as an entry-level hearing aid, this device performs well. Here are some highlights from my experience

Sound Quality: I would rate the sound quality as very good. Since my hearing loss is in the moderate to severe range, the Enhance 50Rs helped some, but not as good as my prescription-strength hearing aids. What I was able to hear was clear and not cluttered with a lot of static. I also thought the hearing aids did a good job of filtering out background noise.

Ease of Use: Overall, the hearing aids are easy to use. Getting started is more complicated than a set of earbuds as you need to properly fit your ears with the right domes. Even though you can use the hearing aids without the app, you get a lot more out of them if you do. When getting started, the app walks you through the process. I also found the app easy to use. It is well-organized and its easy to find the settings you need.

Fit & Feel: The hearing aids are very comfortable. There is a little adjustment period, but they are lightweight and you don’t even notice they are there after a little while.

Customer Service: I wasn’t able to take advantage of the virtual audiology appointment simply because there was a long waiting period. But I did call to get some basic assistance with finding a setting within the app. The rep I had was very knowledgeable and able to help me with my problem.

Overall, I found the Enhance 50R hearing aids to be a strong option for people who need assistance with speech clarity and filtering out background noise during conversations."
5,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Very good quality; a little tech-y though,"A few different things about these hearing aids but the main part ---- they double ask really good earbuds with super crisp sound. They connected seamlessly with bluetooth so my dad was able to take calls and listen to music on his hearing aids. (Side note: he says his hearing aids having this capability makes him feel young somehow haha). Here are some other pros and cons I gathered in my experience:

PROs
Easy bluetooth connection
Good battery charging; one overnight charge and we were able to get several hours out of use over several days.
Comes with an app where you can customize it (the same way a medical professional would)
First hundred days you can free professional assistance from Jabra if needed
3 year warranty; so piece of mind for a long while

CONs
Just one -- the bluetooth (that is also a pro) --- This was the main issue with my dad. His phone would automatically connect to the hearing aids but he was trying to show me another video on his phone but didnt know how to disconnect it. Then wanting to reconnect when he wanted was another thing I had to help him do. Not the best for parents who want to stay independent, but still these are quality, medical grade hearing aids. Worth the price if the tech issues aren't too much for you."
5,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,top choice for up to moderate hearing loss,"As a hearing aid wearer for a few decades, I have seen improvements and advances in technology over the span of my usage. Certainly the introduction of Over the Counter hearing aids is a major force in today’s market. 
For the people with mild to moderate hearing loss, the cost of these devices are about half the price for the “medical grade” hearing aids. Since you are no longer required by laws to have a licensed audiologist or hearing aid dispenser to handle the transaction, the costs are much more affordable.

The audiogram process is a service that medical insurance and Medicare pays for. So if you have coverage, that is probably the best place to start on your hearing improvement journey. 

With the data of an audiogram, you will have a good idea if an OTC hearing aid will have the ""horsepower"" you need. With the data of the study, you can have Jabra adjust the OTC hearing aids to precisely match where in the audible spectrum your acuity is weak. There is also a cheaper option to do an at home, computer based hearing test, with a link at the Jabra web page to test your hearing and set up the hearing aids accordingly. They suggest using a set of headphones and in a quiet place; even a closet is good. Use of the Jabra phone app allows you to further adjust as you familiarize yourself with the amplification and your personal perceived needs. 

The Jabra device incorporates many of the incremental advances that have improved hearing assistance over the past decades.  This is a ""receiver in the ear"" product, where the battery unit fits over the ear as the power source, but the actual speaker resides in the ear canal, and a thin wire connects to the battery unit. This leads to a small, light weight unobtrusive instrument. 
 
A wide selection of alternative rubber fittings is provided to customize to your anatomy and secure the amplifier in your ear canal. Having a secure fit allows optimum delivery of the sound to the eardrum, as even small leaks will let a significant proportion of the sound to escape from the canal. There are three different styles in a range of sizes to fit the majority of people. I switched the perforated dome that was factory installed to a solid, and larger sized dome which was easily accomplished, with definite improvement in the delivery of the sound. 

the instruction manual and online linkage made starting up of the Jabras understandable, especially important to new users of hearing aids.

Built into the separate Jabra app for your iPhone/Android had multiple video links each step along the way.
Once I had registered my hearing aids online, which was simple to do, I received emails, and even a phone call from a human, offering guided support in getting started. You had the options of either phone support or web addresses for a variety of educational modules dealing with all aspects of customizing the device and daily usage. 

Notable advances of hearing aid technology that I have witnessed over the years are well incorporated in the Jabra devices:

Digital amplification.  Digitization allows for speech to be prioritized for amplification by the processor, and dampen the background noises. Digitized sound can be transmitted electronically by Bluetooth over distances of around 10 meters, so you can leave your phone on the table and move about the room. Additional benefits accrue: the squealing of audio feedback, a bane of analog hearing aids, can be recognized and suppressed by digital processing.
 
Rechargeable batteries with a run time of all day. You recharge at night, similar to the ritual of charging your mobile phone overnight. The hassle and expense of changing batteries weekly or for smaller devices, with smaller batteries, even more often, perhaps every 3 or 4 days, is gone.
Wireless recharging of the batteries with a USB powered table top charger. No need to plug anything in; just drop the device into the cradle, the light on the hearing aid turns on, and you know it’s charging.

Shrinkage of size and weight with advances in microelectronics and chip technologies. See the comparison picture of my regular hearing aids to the Jabra Enhance devices. 

Water resistance. However, these are not to be worn swimming or in the shower, of course. But they will not be destroyed by being caught in the rain. 

Receiver in the ear speakers for optimum esthetics and smaller form factor. My photo shows the difference of a “behind the ear” device, where all the electronics are in the white lozenge and the clear plastic tube carries the amplified sound down from the hearing aid to the molded plastic ear piece that is custom fit to the ear configuration. 

“Made for iPhone” (and Android equivalent) linkage to mobile phones offering binaural hearing when using your phone, and additionally the ability to mute out all the background noise while on a phone conversation. 

Ability to use the hearing aids as an equivalent device as earbud headphones for optimized music, podcast, and “live listen” linkage using your mobile phone as your private microphone. 

The only difficulty that I encountered:
The initial linkage of the Jabras to my phone via the app instructed me to “turn off Bluetooth and WiFi”. The app then did a search for the Jabras and stated they were discovered, but the next step when I clicked on the “done” button took me back to the screen that said “hearing aids not connected”, with a button stating “connect hearing aids”. This became a merry-go-round over and over with no obvious remedy. 
This circular path occurred because via the separate linkage in my iPhone to a “Made for iPhone” device was already occupied by my pre-existing hearing aids. The hearing aids did not exit from that linkage, until you specifically go to that area of Settings and ask the phone to remove that device. So turning off Bluetooth in the General settings, will not disconnect them. So the loop of instructions was  written for a phone that had not been previously linked to a Made for iPhone hearing aid. 
Once I recalled the Made for iPhone aspect, I was able to proceed and get the Jabra instruments to connect. Since I have my current hearing aids for three years, I had completely forgotten about that pathway, hidden in Settings. You can fast track to that setting with an iPhone with a triple press of the right sided button on the iPhone. That will automatically open the Accessibility Shortcuts. From there you have access to 3 choices: hearing devices, magnifier, and zoom. You open the hearing devices menu, then tell the phone to “forget” your current hearing aids that you are upgrading from, if they are of the Made for iPhone category. Then magically, the option to choose Jabra Enhance is present. It is smooth sailing from there.

In conclusion, I found the Jabra an excellent choice for those wishing to improve their hearing ability. Various reasons to pursue an OTC solution: perhaps you live too remote from an audiologist, are not that marked in your hearing impairment but recognize there is room for improvement to a more vibrant hearing experience that you recall from earlier in your life, or finances are such that you need to try to limit your expenditures.
Compared to another pair of OTC hearing aids that I trialed, the Jabra were far superior in all aspects, most notably in the robust support and graded options for more involvement. A robust warranty with a long period of coverage (3 years) and ongoing support for those three years. 
I live on the border of moderate to more severe hearing loss, and even at highest volume the Jabra devices reach some limitations. In critical listening environments, attending a lecture in a large auditorium for example, I will depend on my prior hearing aids. But the Jabra set will go with me on all travels, for less critical listening and a worthy backup pair should there be issues with my former hearing aids, or if they need to be sent back to the factory for repairs."
5,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Hearing Aids That Help Me Hear Much Better,"Jabra - Enhance Select 50R Medical Grade Hearing Aid 

There have been a plentiful number of hearing aid products released lately and I have tried a few. Hands down the Jabra Medical Grade Hearing Aids are the best I have tried so far.

I received these hearing aids in the mail and was anxious to try them. The setup was simple but I was experiencing difficulty connected them with Bluetooth on my phone. A call to Jabra support and the aids were working within a few minutes. Customer support was excellent.

The hearing aids themselves are the over the ear type and fit pretty well. They do come with an extensive set of accessories, but so far, I have been using them as they came to me. 

They are still new to me but the phone app was easy to download and install and program the aids. The app features 4 programs that help in different settings. The modes are: 
1. All Around  2. Noisy Restaurant  3. Music  4. Outdoors
There is also a Noise Control Filter and a Speech Clarity Filter.
The themselves are comfortable in the ear.
Now for the 2 best features of these hearing aids:
1. No batteries - These aids come with a charging unit. Thank You!
2. Audiologist Support - Haven't used this yet but I suspect that might be helpful.

Overall, I have no complaint and I am glad I have these hearing aids in my possession. I am still getting used to them but I anticipate that I will be able to use them to help me hear for a long time."
5,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Excellent OTC hearing aid for mild-moderate loss,"I have mild hearing loss and wanted to address it.  Decades of working with dental equipment had taken a toll and my SO was getting tired of repeating himself.  I went to an audiologist and had a hearing test.  It confirmed some changes had occurred in my hearing.  I immediately started researching OTC hearing aids.  Jabra's reviews sold me.  The Jabra - Enhance Select 50R Medical Grade Hearing Aid, sold through Best Buy, is comparable to the Jabra Enhance Select 200.  It has many of the same features with hands-free calling and bluetooth streaming.  The app is well designed and allows the wearer to customize the settings based on their environment.  I love that I can answer the phone with them and listen to podcasts and streaming directly.  And they are rechargeable.  While I was happy with the default settings, I did notice a slight tinniness.  Using my audio gram, the Jabra hearing aid specialist was able to resolve it by adjusting my settings remotely while we met on Zoom.  Jabra provides an affordable solution for mild-moderate hearing loss.  I can't recommend Jabra enough for OTC hearing aids!"
5,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Better hearing,"The Jabra enhance includes an appointment with an audiologist online and a hearing test online so the hearing aids are customized for your hearing deficit. Jarra also includes three years of supplies which includes the wax guard filters and the hearing aid domes, both need to be changed at least every other month or sooner depending on how much wax your ears may produce. They are more expensive than some of the other OTC hearing aids but do come with more perks. These hearing aids are rechargeable so just drop them in the charger every night. They also have blue tooth so can answer your phone calls and the sound is directly in your ears so no one else can hear the conversation. So far very satisfied, time will tell how well they hold up."
5,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"Well made, I need a higher model","These did not work well for me (fit, frequency range), but it is an excellent product.  Use the Jabra online test before spending you money. They will tell you if this model will work for you."
5,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Being able to hear again.,I purchased this product for my Dad and it has been amazing. Great product support as he needed some assistance with the app. He made the statement that putting them in opened up a whole new world for him.
5,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"Excellent product, excellent support.","This is my first experience with hearing aids. I had been examined by a ENT practice and told that I had some hearing loss and would benefit from hearing aids. The prescription products seemed terribly expensive so I investigated the OTC options. Jabra was well reviewed and since they had a generous return Policy I decided to take a chance on them. My purchasing experience with Best Buy was a little sketchy, but worked out okay. Overall I like Best Buy. My customer support from Jabra has been absolutely top drawer. I use an iPhone and the app is easy to use and the devices were easy to set up and start using. I'm still getting used to them, but overall they are helping me considerably. I can recommend these devices and Jabra's support without hesitation. I am quite pleased so far."
5,BestBuy,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,Good Remote Customer Support,"Very easy to use and a very nice package. What appealed to us was the remote customer support available to help tune and tweak the settings, just like you'd get if you got them at the local store owned by the same parent company, but these are a fraction of the cost.

However, it took 3+ weeks to get the first video appointment with their person. During this time we played with all the settings on the phone app, which aren't so hard for a 50-year-old, but a 90-year-old can't do. 

They made no difference for anyone talking to either of us no matter what settings or ear-tips we tried. No help hearing the TV or the phone any better. Only ambient room noise volume increased. 

We were fed up with them by the time we finally got that first remote video appointment but the person on the other end gave us some feelings of hope. She gave us instructions for a hearing test and uploaded new settings to the devices based on the test results. This seemed really promising. 

Unfortunately, it barely made any difference. So on the next follow-up video appointment, the person sent new settings. And did it again. Still not much of a difference. And now here we are past the point of no-return. But we will continue to take advantage of the remote appointments for as long as we can until we can hear people talking."
5,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Easy set up,"These hearing aids were easy to set up with the Iphone, and they now enable me to lower the volume on the TV set and to hear conversations."
5,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Hearing aid good but need activation code,"Had a good experience with one exception.  Purchased these hearing aids from Best Buy and to become functional they needed to be activated by Jabra through use of an activation code. Customer support reps from Best Buy seemed to have no idea what an activation code is and Jabra customer support would not activate without code. Finally worked this out after a number of phone calls and emails but for other purchasers, Best Buy needs to assure they make activation code available to purchasers."
5,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,You cannot go wrong with these,"I own Phonak hearing aids and 1 went on the blink, of course a couple months after the warranty ran out. Those were $3,800 when bought. Had to go back to ENT 6 different times just to get them to connect to my phone!
I decided to look for alternative options and shopped and looked at reviews and decided on the Jabra's. Great decision. These right out of the box are clearer and don't squeal in my ear as the Phonak's did a lot.
1/3 the price and perform right out of the box. I have yet to set up my online appointment with their audiologists for adjustments.
Not so good with phone calls. People tell me I'm breaking up. Music quality is at best, just ok.
Enjoy the savings"

5,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Excellent Over-The-Counter Hearing Aids,"I was excited to receive and evaluate Jabra's Enhance 50R Hearing Aids as my hearing is quite poor. The hearing aids were shipped to me for evaluation and review. When they arrived, I thought they looked a lot like my existing hearing aids that were made in Germany and prescribed by my healthcare provider.

After unboxing these new Jabra Enhance hearing aids and charging them to a full charge, I placed them behind each ear and inserted the domes that were pre-installed on them. They fit perfectely!
Charging the Jabra Enhance is required as they are rechargeable units that do not require batteries. A charging pod comes with the hearing aids and uses a USB-C cord and wall plug both provided in the Jabra package. 10 Minutes of chargind provides 3 hours of use while 3 hours of charging provides 30 hours of use. 

A smaftphone application is required to customize or modify the standard hearing aid settings and is available for download for both Apple and Andorid smarphones. A hearing test is available from Jabra Enhance's website. Once you register as a user, updates will be automatically sent and installed on your hearing aids to better enhance your hearing based on the test results. Other settings are availble through the smarphone application.

The Jabra Enhance hearing aids come with a 3 year warranty, audiologist support for 3 years, free replacement parts and free shipping are included. The initial set of hearing aids comes with a cleaning brush, wax removal tools (10of them), 7 different sizes of in-ear domes, replacement receiver wires, a clamshell carrying/ storage case and 3 year customer support. The hearing aid life is estimated to be 5 years and cleaning is suggested be performed once each month or more frequently if needed. Sport locks are available from Jabra upon request to keep them in place during exercise. For use in humid or other wet conditions, a dryer or silica drying bags should be used. The hearing aids are NOT waterproof and may be 
damaged in very wet conditions.

After charging the hearing aids and downloading the smartphone application, I scheduled a Zoom call with a Jabra Enhance hearing specialist who walked me through the use of the hearing aids. After the call, I recieved an update to the hearing aid seetings that automatically installed in my hearing aids. I also received a follow up email with phone numbers and website addresses should I need to contact Jabra Enhance in the future.

I am very impressed with the Jabra Enhance 50 R hearing aids after wearing them for over a week. They are the best hearing aids I have tried so far and I recommend them highly to you."
5,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,It's time to improve your life,"Having worn hearing aids for several years, I am well acquainted with the exam, fitting, and support process as well as what aids can and cannot do to correct hearing loss. My hearing loss is some beyond the moderate category, but since Jabra partnered with GN Hearing Group, they are a known and respected player in the prescription market. I wanted to find out what level of correction and help their OTC (over the counter) aids can offer. 

Appointments for orientation and audiological support were 2-3 weeks out, so I have not been able to yet evaluate that part of their offering. For those who have not previously worn hearing aids, I want to emphasize that this is a CRITICAL part of the process. As they state on the website, hearing aids are not like glasses. There is an accommodation period as your brain readapts to hearing all the sounds you have been missing. The classic initial comment by new users is … it’s too darn noisy. Be patient and realize that the audiologist may have to readjust your aids several times. It takes time for the brain to regain the ability to sort and sift sounds, and that’s one reason Jabra offers a 100-day trial time for return.

I have been impressed with these aids even though the Enhanced Select 50R is an entry-level product. The quality is excellent. They are rechargeable. They pair with your phone and can stream music and phone calls. More importantly, the pairing allows the use of the Jabra Enhanced app to adjust and change programs (Automatic, Restaurant, Music, Outdoor). As Jabra’s entry-level product, they are best suited to mild/average hearing loss and less demanding listening conditions. Hearing aid technology has been advancing quickly, and a basic aid such as this performs as well as the very high dollar aids of a few years ago (think $7000 for a pair). That said, as you go up the line in Jabra’s offerings, they do get more sophisticated and have more features. Even with my loss, the 50R’s performed very well and are quite good for TV listening and general conversations.

I can easily recommend this product. They offer a lot for the money, and the real advantage of the Enhanced OTC line is the support. If your first experience with hearing aids is an OTC product without support, your chances of a good outcome are limited. That’s the advantage of the support and the 100-day trial … fitting, adjustment, and even recommendations if a higher-level product is needed. If you’ve been thinking about it, or others have been telling you to get your hearing checked, there’s no reason to put it off. Go for it and improve your quality of life."
5,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"Very Complete, Comprehensive Package!","The Jabra Enhance Select 50R hearing aids are an over the counter package that utilizes remote licensed care and online support to provide an offering rivaling the best in-office care at a fraction of the cost. I'm old and I've been wearing hearing aids for several years as I have significant hearing loss. My last pair had developed problems and had to go back to the manufacturer for repair. I decided to try out an over the counter set as a backup. After unsatisfactorily trying a couple of different brands with app only support, I settled on the Jabra Enhance 50R's with app and live online care and support available. They have now become my full time hearing aids with excellent sound quality, situational hearing profiles, and superb battery life.

The Jabra Enhance 50R's are rechargeable, over the ear type that hide behind your ear with a thin wire receiver that is inserted into the ear. In the box there are assorted ear cups, charging stand and usb charger, carrying case, cleaning and other assorted tools and a manual. There is an app to download for control and support. Support is stellar, with live Zoom sessions, instructional videos, online documents and even a useful paper manual. Care is available via phone of video chat session. In many ways it was much more convenient than scheduling an in office appointment with a hearing aid professional, then going back for an adjustment in a couple of weeks. It does require some more of the wearer however.

Setup was easy. Install the app and connect the hearing aids via bluetooth to the phone and app. Yes, they can be used as earbuds as well. Once connected, the firmware level is checked and updated if necessary. After that, create an account at Jabra and log in via computer. There is a hearing test that I did using wired headphones connected to a computer. Listen for a series of tones to determine the frequency curve (really, about how bad your hearing has gotten). The test results are examined by Jabra hearing specialists and the resulting curves pushed down to your hearing aids through the app. Takes a day or two and can be repeated multiple times to fine tune the response. At the same time, a live Zoom session with a specialist is scheduled for about a week out to check the initial tuning.

I have large ears and needed longer wires than were initially supplied. There is a gauge in the package, put in over your ear and take a picture of each ear and send it in. Jabra fedex'ed the wires to me two days later. I had to change them, but the tool is supplied in the box and there are videos demonstrating how to change the wires. It was very easy. After a few days wearing the Enhanc 50R's, I requested a slight change to the tuning for voice. It was pushed out a day later. I have a follow on video session scheduled for another week out to check the settings.

As I statee earlier, battery life of the Enhance 50R's is stellar. Previous rechargeable hearing aids would last through the day, but needed to be recharged at the end of each day. Although Jabra rates the 50R's at up to 30hrs, I've managed to go through an entire weekend, turning them off when going to bed without recharging. I am very active, bicycling upwards of 200 miles a week and am a bit of a gym rat. The 50R's seem to handle sweat, and an accidental shower or two, without a problem.

Jabra seems to have really gone all in on providing as close to in-office support as possible. Support and warranty continue for three years, which is the probable lifetime of the hearing aids. All in all, I am exceptionally pleased with both the hearing aid performance and the level of support provided by Jabra in the Enhance 50R package. I highly recommend them."

I remember my grandparents having to pay $5000 dollars for their hearing aids. Highway robbery! Not only are these a superior product compared to what they wore in her day but the much more affordable price and convenience makes it worth every penny!

One of the best things about these are you don't have to go to a doctor’s office for these to be adjusted or sized for fitment. They have a convenient and easy to maneuver app that can be downloaded on your phone whether you have android or apple. Whether your tech savvy or not they made it super simple for anyone to get the results they desire


I've worn multiple medical grade hearing assistant devices and I have to say these are the smallest, lightest, almost not even noticeable that they're there.. pair of hearing aids that I've had the pleasure of using. No longer are the days where you can spot who's wearing a hearing aid from across the room. You'd have that big back piece hanging on the back of your ear and thick plastic straw looking tube with the big plastic piece filling your entire inner ear canal. 

The main device hides inconspicuously behind your ear with a small thin tube that's more like the size of a Capellini noodle (angel hair pasta noodle) that goes down into the ear resting comfortably.  

You have eight hearing channels and four listening modes. They come with three different size domes so pretty much any ear size is covered (small, medium, and large). They’re quoted as having a battery life of thirty hours and a charge time of three hours. With using a USB type C cord, I was surprised a full charge on something so small would take that long when my phone with a much larger batter using the type C charger fills the battery in a lot faster time. But with lasting more than a full day on a single charge and normally taking them out to sleep anyways, the charge time isn’t really a inconvenience.

Overall I’d highly recommend them to others with similar hearing demands"
5,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,A Great Choice for Affordable Hearing Improvement,"With the new change to prescription hearing aids, there are a lot of options becoming available to the consumers. I have to say the Jabra Enhance Select is definitely the best that I have tried so far.

One of the best things about the Jabra Enhance hearing aids is that they are over-the-counter (OTC). This means that you can purchase them without a prescription from an audiologist. This makes them easily available to anyone.

The Jabra Enhance hearing aids are also very easy to use. They come with a comprehensive instruction manual and a user-friendly app. The app allows you to customize the hearing aids to your specific needs and preferences, such as adjusting the volume, switching between different listening modes, and creating personalized sound profiles. Using the app was super simple and easy to use.

The Jabra Enhance hearing aids offer excellent sound quality. They use digital amplification technology to prioritize speech for clarity and reduce background noise. I was able to clearly hear conversations from anywhere in the room.

In addition to their excellent sound quality, the Jabra Enhance hearing aids are also very comfortable to wear. They are small and lightweight, and they come with a variety of ear tips which is great since I've always have trouble fitting earbuds properly.

They also have a built-in tinnitus masker, which can help to reduce the ringing or buzzing sound in your ears.

Overall, I am very happy with my new hearing aids. It will be a major improvement to my life."
5,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Definitely helps alleviate hearing issues,"I will start off by saying my hearing is limited but not severe - my eustachian tubes are restricted so I'll oftentimes will experience muffled sounds so boosting any auditory input with the Jabra Enhance Select 50R is surprisingly effective at clearing things up. If it helps to clarify a little more on my level of hearing loss, I struggle to hear softer softs and have a particularly difficult time locating the direction from which tinny sounds originate from - think something along the lines of the hearing tests at the DMV (I fail 100% of the time) or the pinging noises to locate Apple AirPods or even an AirTag.  

I think it's important to note that this device utilizes ""wide dynamic range compression"" (WDRC), which compresses a wide range of sound levels rather just limiting loud noises or whatnot.  My understanding is that it takes in the full range of sounds and compresses into a range that the user can hear them all instead of just limiting specific range of sounds.  Hearing aids (or any microphone, really) have directional preferences when it comes to audio inputs.  The Jabras use hypercardioid microphones , which generally doesn't do great with picking up sounds from sources from the rear and sides; they are much better utilized for sounds coming from the front (unidirectionally optimized), which makes more sense for conversations and watching TV. 

I'm using iOS17 and the Jabra Enhance Pro app and it works as one would expect; I'd say it's pretty simple to get set up and follow prompts for ensuring a good fit and customized sounds.  If this is being purchased for someone elderly or just a person without a basic understanding of standard tech, some assistance is definitely required.  The Enhance Pro App has a surprisingly decent amount of customization and setting features - equalizer adjustments, location of lost/misplaced hearing aids, tinnitus manager...the settings are sufficient to adapt to your personal level of hearing loss.  Mine being ""minimal"" compared to most users, it didn't require TOO much from a modification perspective but it definitely helped.  I believe the app also allows to get technical help remotely, which is a good back up for those who can't troubleshoot on their own.  

The battery is solid - I've been recharging them at night on my nightstand but the product is rated for like 30 hours on a single charge, which is absolutely insane.  The box comes with a USB-C charging cable so it's not anything proprietary to be able to get the recharging dock set up.  Other items in the box includes a MASSIVE assortment of silicone plugs to ensure a comfortable seal, a cleaning brush/cloth, wax guards, and some various documentation to help get things started.  I've been taking phone calls and listening to music with these too but I don't really know what the battery life is if I did both for extended periods of time.  I think I'll have a better idea during a long plane ride.  

I got the grey color as it's small enough to be inconspicuous but large enough to look awkward in the beige color.  I'd rather it be clear that I'm wearing a hearing aid than people assume I have an odd growth behind my ear - but that's just a personal preference.  It's an over-ear fit and it's honestly pretty dang comfortable. 

MOST importantly!! There's a 3-year warranty on these guys with a 3-year loss and damage coverage.  For something so small and being used regularly, this is a great insurance plan."
5,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Truly an OTC replacement for my prescription aids,"I have worn hearing aids for around 4 years now. I tried a couple of the over-the-counter hearing aids from the warehouse clubs before buying the expensive hearing aids from an audiologist. The over-the-counter (OTC) aids that I tried were no help for my hearing loss. My main complaint was and still is understanding others in a conversation in a noisy room. After years of adjustments and knowing others that wear hearing aids, I have come to understand that while hearing aids can help, nothing will completely remedy the noisy room. Since the FTC changed the rules for OTC hearing aids, I have tried several of the new generation OTC hearing aids. The other new generation aids did not seem to help my particular hearing loss either. I wasn't sure if the aids themselves were not capable or perhaps if the online hearing tests were lacking. 

The Jabra-Enhance Select 50R Medical Grade Hearing Aid is the first OTC hearing aid that for my hearing loss is a suitable replacement for my audiologist supplied hearing aids. The setup was quick and easy. The app has All Around (average situations), Restaurants, Music and Outdoor settings. Within each major setting there are options for things such as emphasizing speech clarity, noise filter... There is also a graphic equalizer, allowing you to customize each setting.  These hearing aids allow streaming of phone calls and music to the hearing aids which is a great improvement over my current aids. While Jabra has an online (or perhaps in-app) hearing test, they also allow you to e-mail an audiogram to them. My assumption was that a fairly recent audiogram from my audiologist had to be more accurate than a self-test. Included in the setup is a video meeting with an audiologist. During that meeting I was taken through setup, use and cleaning of the hearing aids. The audiologist also adjusted my hearing aids to the specs that the audiogram that I previously sent to her. We scheduled a video follow up which has not yet occurred. These hearing aids are able replace my expensive audiologist supplied hearing aids in every area so far. Three years of hearing care are included with the purchase of these aids. I love everything about these and have not used my prescription aids since getting these."

Just a few of the great features that are beneficial to have in hearing aids like the Jabra Enhance Select 50R Medical Grade Hearing Aids are - Noise reduction that cleans up background noise to enhance speech clarity. Directional microphones that focus on sounds in front while reducing sounds from other directions. Feedback cancellation that minimizes whistling or feedback noise. Wireless connectivity that enables connection to smartphones, TVs, and other devices for direct audio streaming. Rechargeable batteries instead of replaceable non-rechargeable disposable batteries. Automatic programming that adjusts settings automatically based on the environment. Multiple programs/memory settings that offer different settings for various listening environments (e.g., noisy environments, music, outdoors etc.). Bluetooth compatibility that offers direct connectivity with smartphones and other Bluetooth-enabled devices. A smartphone app that allows you to adjust settings. Water and Dust resistance that protects the hearing aids from environmental damage.

The adjustability is awesome. Upon receiving my hearing aids, I charged them over night. The next evening, I downloaded the Jabra Enhance Select app. I tried to get the hearing aids to pair with my phone, but they would not. I quit for the evening and retried the next morning. While trying again and having no luck I received a call from customer service. They reminded me that I needed to set up an appointment for orientation and hearing test support. She the assisted me with getting the hearing aids to pair with my phone. After I completed the set up and took the hearing test, I tried to set the appointment. Appointments are 2 weeks out. So, I cannot include that process in this posting. I now have a working set of hearing aids; however, I cannot complete the fine tuning until after my appointment. I was able to get the volume level of hearing aids to a lower level thus cutting out the loud hissing. I then tried the 4 preset programs. Automatic, restaurant, outdoors and music.
Each hearing aid is color coded for the proper ear. The charging case is also color coded. A full charge is good for about 30 hours of listening. The Jabra Enhance Select 50R hearing aids can also be used to stream music and answer call from the phone. Unlike most other Over the counter hearing aids, these are adjustable to each ear. The kit comes complete with many earpiece ends, and varying sizes. There are also cleaning supplies and instructions to properly clean without damaging.

These are his first rechargeable pair and not only has the charging dock been a game changer for him, there are other features that he adores, which even amazed me, as a techie. 

First, in the box came tulip tips (think normal earbuds), open tips, and closed tips. With the latter two in different (tiny) sizes and plenty of backups.

Thing that impressed me most was once paired with his iPhone, there was a triple click menu for volume, balance, listening options (music, restaurant, etc), and ambient noise (rainfall sounds—why?). The integration with iPhone was extremely impressive as an in-iOS software menu.

Jabra - Enhance Select 50R Medical Grade Hearing Aid - With Virtual Audiology Care

I’m very impressed with the total package that Jabra provides with these hearing aids. The charger is solid and easy to use. The carrying case is nicely shaped and convenient for a pocket or purse. The wide range of tips for various ear sizes and open air or domed shapes make it easy to customize. I even found that one of my ears is smaller.

I used the app to customize my hearing experience with the ability to set the volume and equalization for each ear. I can choose from four built-in presets: all around, music, outdoor, and restaurant, as well as adjustments to those settings.

I did find a slight delay in accepting a phone call, but that’s more a Bluetooth issue than a negative for the aids, themselves. They do provide very clear call quality. 

What seals the deal for me is the included virtual audiology care provided by licensed hearing professionals. I found the service to be polite, professional, informative, very personable, and helpful. After I registered, the audiology specialist called to set up a Zoom appointment and had me send them a picture of my audiology work up from a recent hearing appointment. 

When I met with them over Zoom, they were able to remotely set my hearing aids using that info and my preferences from using the aids for a few days. That becomes the new default whenever I put them on. 

They were very thorough and made sure I understood how to use the app, the aids, and even how to care for them long term. They checked the measurements on the wires using the included tool and offered to send me different length wires if I thought that would improve the fit. Overall, a very satisfying experience!"

5,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,A Great Choice for Affordable Hearing Improvement,"With the new change to prescription hearing aids, there are a lot of options becoming available to the consumers. I have to say the Jabra Enhance Select is definitely the best that I have tried so far.

One of the best things about the Jabra Enhance hearing aids is that they are over-the-counter (OTC). This means that you can purchase them without a prescription from an audiologist. This makes them easily available to anyone.

The Jabra Enhance hearing aids are also very easy to use. They come with a comprehensive instruction manual and a user-friendly app. The app allows you to customize the hearing aids to your specific needs and preferences, such as adjusting the volume, switching between different listening modes, and creating personalized sound profiles. Using the app was super simple and easy to use.

The Jabra Enhance hearing aids offer excellent sound quality. They use digital amplification technology to prioritize speech for clarity and reduce background noise. I was able to clearly hear conversations from anywhere in the room.

In addition to their excellent sound quality, the Jabra Enhance hearing aids are also very comfortable to wear. They are small and lightweight, and they come with a variety of ear tips which is great since I've always have trouble fitting earbuds properly.

They also have a built-in tinnitus masker, which can help to reduce the ringing or buzzing sound in your ears.

Overall, I am very happy with my new hearing aids. It will be a major improvement to my life."
5,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Definitely helps alleviate hearing issues,"I will start off by saying my hearing is limited but not severe - my eustachian tubes are restricted so I'll oftentimes will experience muffled sounds so boosting any auditory input with the Jabra Enhance Select 50R is surprisingly effective at clearing things up. If it helps to clarify a little more on my level of hearing loss, I struggle to hear softer softs and have a particularly difficult time locating the direction from which tinny sounds originate from - think something along the lines of the hearing tests at the DMV (I fail 100% of the time) or the pinging noises to locate Apple AirPods or even an AirTag.  

I think it's important to note that this device utilizes ""wide dynamic range compression"" (WDRC), which compresses a wide range of sound levels rather just limiting loud noises or whatnot.  My understanding is that it takes in the full range of sounds and compresses into a range that the user can hear them all instead of just limiting specific range of sounds.  Hearing aids (or any microphone, really) have directional preferences when it comes to audio inputs.  The Jabras use hypercardioid microphones , which generally doesn't do great with picking up sounds from sources from the rear and sides; they are much better utilized for sounds coming from the front (unidirectionally optimized), which makes more sense for conversations and watching TV. 

I'm using iOS17 and the Jabra Enhance Pro app and it works as one would expect; I'd say it's pretty simple to get set up and follow prompts for ensuring a good fit and customized sounds.  If this is being purchased for someone elderly or just a person without a basic understanding of standard tech, some assistance is definitely required.  The Enhance Pro App has a surprisingly decent amount of customization and setting features - equalizer adjustments, location of lost/misplaced hearing aids, tinnitus manager...the settings are sufficient to adapt to your personal level of hearing loss.  Mine being ""minimal"" compared to most users, it didn't require TOO much from a modification perspective but it definitely helped.  I believe the app also allows to get technical help remotely, which is a good back up for those who can't troubleshoot on their own.  

The battery is solid - I've been recharging them at night on my nightstand but the product is rated for like 30 hours on a single charge, which is absolutely insane.  The box comes with a USB-C charging cable so it's not anything proprietary to be able to get the recharging dock set up.  Other items in the box includes a MASSIVE assortment of silicone plugs to ensure a comfortable seal, a cleaning brush/cloth, wax guards, and some various documentation to help get things started.  I've been taking phone calls and listening to music with these too but I don't really know what the battery life is if I did both for extended periods of time.  I think I'll have a better idea during a long plane ride.  

I got the grey color as it's small enough to be inconspicuous but large enough to look awkward in the beige color.  I'd rather it be clear that I'm wearing a hearing aid than people assume I have an odd growth behind my ear - but that's just a personal preference.  It's an over-ear fit and it's honestly pretty dang comfortable. 

MOST importantly!! There's a 3-year warranty on these guys with a 3-year loss and damage coverage.  For something so small and being used regularly, this is a great insurance plan."
5,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Truly an OTC replacement for my prescription aids,"I have worn hearing aids for around 4 years now. I tried a couple of the over-the-counter hearing aids from the warehouse clubs before buying the expensive hearing aids from an audiologist. The over-the-counter (OTC) aids that I tried were no help for my hearing loss. My main complaint was and still is understanding others in a conversation in a noisy room. After years of adjustments and knowing others that wear hearing aids, I have come to understand that while hearing aids can help, nothing will completely remedy the noisy room. Since the FTC changed the rules for OTC hearing aids, I have tried several of the new generation OTC hearing aids. The other new generation aids did not seem to help my particular hearing loss either. I wasn't sure if the aids themselves were not capable or perhaps if the online hearing tests were lacking. 

The Jabra-Enhance Select 50R Medical Grade Hearing Aid is the first OTC hearing aid that for my hearing loss is a suitable replacement for my audiologist supplied hearing aids. The setup was quick and easy. The app has All Around (average situations), Restaurants, Music and Outdoor settings. Within each major setting there are options for things such as emphasizing speech clarity, noise filter... There is also a graphic equalizer, allowing you to customize each setting.  These hearing aids allow streaming of phone calls and music to the hearing aids which is a great improvement over my current aids. While Jabra has an online (or perhaps in-app) hearing test, they also allow you to e-mail an audiogram to them. My assumption was that a fairly recent audiogram from my audiologist had to be more accurate than a self-test. Included in the setup is a video meeting with an audiologist. During that meeting I was taken through setup, use and cleaning of the hearing aids. The audiologist also adjusted my hearing aids to the specs that the audiogram that I previously sent to her. We scheduled a video follow up which has not yet occurred. These hearing aids are able replace my expensive audiologist supplied hearing aids in every area so far. Three years of hearing care are included with the purchase of these aids. I love everything about these and have not used my prescription aids since getting these."
5,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Good hearing is easy now!,"The Jabra Enhance Select 50R Medical Grade Hearing Aids (to me they are a hybrid as you get hearing specialist assistance via internet or phone) are available over-the-counter (OTC), which means you don't need to go through a lengthy process to get them, like you would with prescription (office visit required) hearing aids.
Just a few of the great features that are beneficial to have in hearing aids like the Jabra Enhance Select 50R Medical Grade Hearing Aids are - Noise reduction that cleans up background noise to enhance speech clarity. Directional microphones that focus on sounds in front while reducing sounds from other directions. Feedback cancellation that minimizes whistling or feedback noise. Wireless connectivity that enables connection to smartphones, TVs, and other devices for direct audio streaming. Rechargeable batteries instead of replaceable non-rechargeable disposable batteries. Automatic programming that adjusts settings automatically based on the environment. Multiple programs/memory settings that offer different settings for various listening environments (e.g., noisy environments, music, outdoors etc.). Bluetooth compatibility that offers direct connectivity with smartphones and other Bluetooth-enabled devices. A smartphone app that allows you to adjust settings. Water and Dust resistance that protects the hearing aids from environmental damage.

To sum it all up the (Jabra Enhance Select 50R Medical Grade Hearing Aids and app) are easy  of use, have are easy to fit and feel great, their customer service helpfulness is fast and professional, and the quality of manufacturing is excellent."
5,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Jabra Enhance Select 50R Hearing Aid,"So far, the Jabra Enhance Select 50R Medical Grade/GN Hearing Group hearing aids are the best I have tried. The adjustability is awesome. Upon receiving my hearing aids, I charged them over night. The next evening, I downloaded the Jabra Enhance Select app. I tried to get the hearing aids to pair with my phone, but they would not. I quit for the evening and retried the next morning. While trying again and having no luck I received a call from customer service. They reminded me that I needed to set up an appointment for orientation and hearing test support. She the assisted me with getting the hearing aids to pair with my phone. After I completed the set up and took the hearing test, I tried to set the appointment. Appointments are 2 weeks out. So, I cannot include that process in this posting. I now have a working set of hearing aids; however, I cannot complete the fine tuning until after my appointment. I was able to get the volume level of hearing aids to a lower level thus cutting out the loud hissing. I then tried the 4 preset programs. Automatic, restaurant, outdoors and music.
Each hearing aid is color coded for the proper ear. The charging case is also color coded. A full charge is good for about 30 hours of listening. The Jabra Enhance Select 50R hearing aids can also be used to stream music and answer call from the phone. Unlike most other Over the counter hearing aids, these are adjustable to each ear. The kit comes complete with many earpiece ends, and varying sizes. There are also cleaning supplies and instructions to properly clean without damaging. 
After using the hearing aids for 2 days they quit pairing with the app, the hearing aids still worked fine I just could not connect with the app."
5,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"Coming from batteries, these are game changers!","I am my father’s primary tech caregiver. I got him battery operated hearing aids as his first pair and they work wonderfully, connecting with iPhone and giving him a new lease on life. The only thing was I couldn’t get him to wear them enough because he was always fumbling with very small batteries and only used them on special occasions due to that.

These are his first rechargeable pair and not only has the charging dock been a game changer for him, there are other features that he adores, which even amazed me, as a techie. 

First, in the box came tulip tips (think normal earbuds), open tips, and closed tips. With the latter two in different (tiny) sizes and plenty of backups. There were multiple cleaning tools and all of the accessories I would think I would ever need. Only thing that his other pair had that would’ve been nice in the package would’ve been different sized cords, the thin plastic tubes that connect the battery and circuitry to the actual buds that go in the canal. They are interchangeable, his other brand came with them, and these came with a measuring tool but requires you to contact Jabra directly to request a different length.

Thing that impressed me most was once paired with his iPhone, there was a triple click menu for volume, balance, listening options (music, restaurant, etc), and ambient noise (rainfall sounds—why?). The integration with iPhone was extremely impressive as an in-iOS software menu. 

Due to the ease of use and integration with iOS, I now have him wearing them every day. He listens to his radio stations with them in, he takes his phone calls with them in. They are like permanent AirPods. Highly, highly recommended."

Jabra - Enhance Select 50R Medical Grade Hearing Aid - With Virtual Audiology Care

I’m very impressed with the total package that Jabra provides with these hearing aids. The charger is solid and easy to use. The carrying case is nicely shaped and convenient for a pocket or purse. The wide range of tips for various ear sizes and open air or domed shapes make it easy to customize. I even found that one of my ears is smaller.

I used the app to customize my hearing experience with the ability to set the volume and equalization for each ear. I can choose from four built-in presets: all around, music, outdoor, and restaurant, as well as adjustments to those settings.

I did find a slight delay in accepting a phone call, but that’s more a Bluetooth issue than a negative for the aids, themselves. They do provide very clear call quality. 

What seals the deal for me is the included virtual audiology care provided by licensed hearing professionals. I found the service to be polite, professional, informative, very personable, and helpful. After I registered, the audiology specialist called to set up a Zoom appointment and had me send them a picture of my audiology work up from a recent hearing appointment. 

When I met with them over Zoom, they were able to remotely set my hearing aids using that info and my preferences from using the aids for a few days. That becomes the new default whenever I put them on. 

They were very thorough and made sure I understood how to use the app, the aids, and even how to care for them long term. They checked the measurements on the wires using the included tool and offered to send me different length wires if I thought that would improve the fit. Overall, a very satisfying experience!"
5,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Doug L,My previous hearing aids were a well known high end brand that were six years old and out of warranty and starting to have problems.

When answering the phone the sound goes right in your ear. Also, you can vary the settings for whatever environment you're in. Still getting used to them, but I realize when I take them out, how much they really help me hear better. I love the product, the quality and the way that is has opened up a life for me.

5,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Definitely helps alleviate hearing issues,"I will start off by saying my hearing is limited but not severe - my eustachian tubes are restricted so I'll oftentimes will experience muffled sounds so boosting any auditory input with the Jabra Enhance Select 50R is surprisingly effective at clearing things up. If it helps to clarify a little more on my level of hearing loss, I struggle to hear softer softs and have a particularly difficult time locating the direction from which tinny sounds originate from - think something along the lines of the hearing tests at the DMV (I fail 100% of the time) or the pinging noises to locate Apple AirPods or even an AirTag.  

I think it's important to note that this device utilizes ""wide dynamic range compression"" (WDRC), which compresses a wide range of sound levels rather just limiting loud noises or whatnot.  My understanding is that it takes in the full range of sounds and compresses into a range that the user can hear them all instead of just limiting specific range of sounds.  Hearing aids (or any microphone, really) have directional preferences when it comes to audio inputs.  The Jabras use hypercardioid microphones , which generally doesn't do great with picking up sounds from sources from the rear and sides; they are much better utilized for sounds coming from the front (unidirectionally optimized), which makes more sense for conversations and watching TV. 

I'm using iOS17 and the Jabra Enhance Pro app and it works as one would expect; I'd say it's pretty simple to get set up and follow prompts for ensuring a good fit and customized sounds.  If this is being purchased for someone elderly or just a person without a basic understanding of standard tech, some assistance is definitely required.  The Enhance Pro App has a surprisingly decent amount of customization and setting features - equalizer adjustments, location of lost/misplaced hearing aids, tinnitus manager...the settings are sufficient to adapt to your personal level of hearing loss.  Mine being ""minimal"" compared to most users, it didn't require TOO much from a modification perspective but it definitely helped.  I believe the app also allows to get technical help remotely, which is a good back up for those who can't troubleshoot on their own.  

The battery is solid - I've been recharging them at night on my nightstand but the product is rated for like 30 hours on a single charge, which is absolutely insane.  The box comes with a USB-C charging cable so it's not anything proprietary to be able to get the recharging dock set up.  Other items in the box includes a MASSIVE assortment of silicone plugs to ensure a comfortable seal, a cleaning brush/cloth, wax guards, and some various documentation to help get things started.  I've been taking phone calls and listening to music with these too but I don't really know what the battery life is if I did both for extended periods of time.  I think I'll have a better idea during a long plane ride.  

I got the grey color as it's small enough to be inconspicuous but large enough to look awkward in the beige color.  I'd rather it be clear that I'm wearing a hearing aid than people assume I have an odd growth behind my ear - but that's just a personal preference.  It's an over-ear fit and it's honestly pretty dang comfortable. 

MOST importantly!! There's a 3-year warranty on these guys with a 3-year loss and damage coverage.  For something so small and being used regularly, this is a great insurance plan."
5,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Truly an OTC replacement for my prescription aids,"I have worn hearing aids for around 4 years now. I tried a couple of the over-the-counter hearing aids from the warehouse clubs before buying the expensive hearing aids from an audiologist. The over-the-counter (OTC) aids that I tried were no help for my hearing loss. My main complaint was and still is understanding others in a conversation in a noisy room. After years of adjustments and knowing others that wear hearing aids, I have come to understand that while hearing aids can help, nothing will completely remedy the noisy room. Since the FTC changed the rules for OTC hearing aids, I have tried several of the new generation OTC hearing aids. The other new generation aids did not seem to help my particular hearing loss either. I wasn't sure if the aids themselves were not capable or perhaps if the online hearing tests were lacking. 

The Jabra-Enhance Select 50R Medical Grade Hearing Aid is the first OTC hearing aid that for my hearing loss is a suitable replacement for my audiologist supplied hearing aids. The setup was quick and easy. The app has All Around (average situations), Restaurants, Music and Outdoor settings. Within each major setting there are options for things such as emphasizing speech clarity, noise filter... There is also a graphic equalizer, allowing you to customize each setting.  These hearing aids allow streaming of phone calls and music to the hearing aids which is a great improvement over my current aids. While Jabra has an online (or perhaps in-app) hearing test, they also allow you to e-mail an audiogram to them. My assumption was that a fairly recent audiogram from my audiologist had to be more accurate than a self-test. Included in the setup is a video meeting with an audiologist. During that meeting I was taken through setup, use and cleaning of the hearing aids. The audiologist also adjusted my hearing aids to the specs that the audiogram that I previously sent to her. We scheduled a video follow up which has not yet occurred. These hearing aids are able replace my expensive audiologist supplied hearing aids in every area so far. Three years of hearing care are included with the purchase of these aids. I love everything about these and have not used my prescription aids since getting these."
5,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Good hearing is easy now!,"The Jabra Enhance Select 50R Medical Grade Hearing Aids (to me they are a hybrid as you get hearing specialist assistance via internet or phone) are available over-the-counter (OTC), which means you don't need to go through a lengthy process to get them, like you would with prescription (office visit required) hearing aids.
Just a few of the great features that are beneficial to have in hearing aids like the Jabra Enhance Select 50R Medical Grade Hearing Aids are - Noise reduction that cleans up background noise to enhance speech clarity. Directional microphones that focus on sounds in front while reducing sounds from other directions. Feedback cancellation that minimizes whistling or feedback noise. Wireless connectivity that enables connection to smartphones, TVs, and other devices for direct audio streaming. Rechargeable batteries instead of replaceable non-rechargeable disposable batteries. Automatic programming that adjusts settings automatically based on the environment. Multiple programs/memory settings that offer different settings for various listening environments (e.g., noisy environments, music, outdoors etc.). Bluetooth compatibility that offers direct connectivity with smartphones and other Bluetooth-enabled devices. A smartphone app that allows you to adjust settings. Water and Dust resistance that protects the hearing aids from environmental damage.

To sum it all up the (Jabra Enhance Select 50R Medical Grade Hearing Aids and app) are easy  of use, have are easy to fit and feel great, their customer service helpfulness is fast and professional, and the quality of manufacturing is excellent."
5,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Jabra Enhance Select 50R Hearing Aid,"So far, the Jabra Enhance Select 50R Medical Grade/GN Hearing Group hearing aids are the best I have tried. The adjustability is awesome. Upon receiving my hearing aids, I charged them over night. The next evening, I downloaded the Jabra Enhance Select app. I tried to get the hearing aids to pair with my phone, but they would not. I quit for the evening and retried the next morning. While trying again and having no luck I received a call from customer service. They reminded me that I needed to set up an appointment for orientation and hearing test support. She the assisted me with getting the hearing aids to pair with my phone. After I completed the set up and took the hearing test, I tried to set the appointment. Appointments are 2 weeks out. So, I cannot include that process in this posting. I now have a working set of hearing aids; however, I cannot complete the fine tuning until after my appointment. I was able to get the volume level of hearing aids to a lower level thus cutting out the loud hissing. I then tried the 4 preset programs. Automatic, restaurant, outdoors and music.
Each hearing aid is color coded for the proper ear. The charging case is also color coded. A full charge is good for about 30 hours of listening. The Jabra Enhance Select 50R hearing aids can also be used to stream music and answer call from the phone. Unlike most other Over the counter hearing aids, these are adjustable to each ear. The kit comes complete with many earpiece ends, and varying sizes. There are also cleaning supplies and instructions to properly clean without damaging. 
After using the hearing aids for 2 days they quit pairing with the app, the hearing aids still worked fine I just could not connect with the app."
5,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"Coming from batteries, these are game changers!","I am my father’s primary tech caregiver. I got him battery operated hearing aids as his first pair and they work wonderfully, connecting with iPhone and giving him a new lease on life. The only thing was I couldn’t get him to wear them enough because he was always fumbling with very small batteries and only used them on special occasions due to that.

These are his first rechargeable pair and not only has the charging dock been a game changer for him, there are other features that he adores, which even amazed me, as a techie. 

First, in the box came tulip tips (think normal earbuds), open tips, and closed tips. With the latter two in different (tiny) sizes and plenty of backups. There were multiple cleaning tools and all of the accessories I would think I would ever need. Only thing that his other pair had that would’ve been nice in the package would’ve been different sized cords, the thin plastic tubes that connect the battery and circuitry to the actual buds that go in the canal. They are interchangeable, his other brand came with them, and these came with a measuring tool but requires you to contact Jabra directly to request a different length.

Thing that impressed me most was once paired with his iPhone, there was a triple click menu for volume, balance, listening options (music, restaurant, etc), and ambient noise (rainfall sounds—why?). The integration with iPhone was extremely impressive as an in-iOS software menu. 

Due to the ease of use and integration with iOS, I now have him wearing them every day. He listens to his radio stations with them in, he takes his phone calls with them in. They are like permanent AirPods. Highly, highly recommended."

Jabra - Enhance Select 50R Medical Grade Hearing Aid - With Virtual Audiology Care

I’m very impressed with the total package that Jabra provides with these hearing aids. The charger is solid and easy to use. The carrying case is nicely shaped and convenient for a pocket or purse. The wide range of tips for various ear sizes and open air or domed shapes make it easy to customize. I even found that one of my ears is smaller.

I used the app to customize my hearing experience with the ability to set the volume and equalization for each ear. I can choose from four built-in presets: all around, music, outdoor, and restaurant, as well as adjustments to those settings.

I did find a slight delay in accepting a phone call, but that’s more a Bluetooth issue than a negative for the aids, themselves. They do provide very clear call quality. 

What seals the deal for me is the included virtual audiology care provided by licensed hearing professionals. I found the service to be polite, professional, informative, very personable, and helpful. After I registered, the audiology specialist called to set up a Zoom appointment and had me send them a picture of my audiology work up from a recent hearing appointment. 

When I met with them over Zoom, they were able to remotely set my hearing aids using that info and my preferences from using the aids for a few days. That becomes the new default whenever I put them on. 

They were very thorough and made sure I understood how to use the app, the aids, and even how to care for them long term. They checked the measurements on the wires using the included tool and offered to send me different length wires if I thought that would improve the fit. Overall, a very satisfying experience!"

Jabra Enhance has delivered as promised. As with any change, there is a period of adjustment to the new normal, but in my case, that period has been relatively brief and easy. Another very attractive element in the Jabra Enhance business model is the superb value for money when compared to the traditional hearing aid industry. I really love the Bluetooth technology. When answering the phone the sound goes right in your ear. Also, you can vary the settings for whatever environment you're in. Still getting used to them, but I realize when I take them out, how much they really help me hear better. I love the product, the quality and the way that is has opened up a life for me.

14,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Hearing Aids That Double As Bluetooth Earplugs,"HP - Hearing PRO Self-Fitting OTC Hearing Aids 

I received these OTC hearing aids for evaluation purposes and my review that follows.

In regard to these HP Hearing Aids, there are things I really like about them and something I really didn't care for.
THE POSITIVES
First of all, the hearing aids work really well. I have paid thousands for others and I hear better with these aids than all the hearing devices I have tried over the last fifteen years. I hear very well with them in my ears. 
In addition to hearing aids, these aids work very well as Bluetooth earbuds. The Stones sounded great when I listened to Gimme' Shelter. 
Another positive aspect is that they have a rechargeable battery of USB powered charging case. This means no more batteries!

The NOT - SO POSITIVES

These hearing aids are big and heavy than I would like. It constantly felt like they could fall out of my ear and sometimes they did slip.
Additionally, the battery only lasted about 6 hours and even less when playing music through my cell phone.

Overall, I like the product. The size, weight and battery stamina leave a little to be desired but I still find enough positives to use these hearing aids at least around the house."
14,BestBuy,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,In hear bud style hearing aides.,"I tested these on my mother in law has lost her hearing over the years and has had several hearing aids over the course of of her life.

At first glance.  I had predisposed opinions but went through the setup and testing.

Setup was pretty easy.  Downloaded the android app on the play store followed the instructions and linked the buds to the app.

I had my mom go through the hearing testing/calibration.  It was not easy for her as she is in her 80s.  We got through it together and we were all set.

Physical setup in the ear was ok.  So this is where I have my predisposed opinions where I thought they were a bit big for hearing aides.  For the older generations they don't like to admit that they have hearing issues so wearing hearing aides that are large is a double whammy for them.  1 it brings attention to their hearing issues and 2 it hits their pride for admitting that they are getting old.

These are big...  They look like ear buds you would wear like in hear phones.  If you are ok with that then the rest is history.  For my mother in law it was a no go.

They were easy to put in the ear and position. Just like in ear buds use.  Push in twist and you are all set.

Software use was easy to use after calibration.

Amplification was decent my mom said that it worked with her hearing loss and helped her hearing music especially in her 1 ear that has serious hearing damage.

The charger/carrying case is nice.  Easy left and right magnetic holders..  USB c plug so that's a plus.

I am happy that hearing aides are over the counter now....  People have access to getting them on their own and not need a prescription.  Base on all this I would recommend these hearing aides based on their bulky nature.  BUT I could not give it full star review."
14,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Looks nothing like a traditional hearing aid.,"For now, I'm rating these at 4 stars. If HP ads a little fine tuning to the app, I would lean toward 5 stars. Here's why... Pros Better hearing -- I have significant, though not devastating, hearing loss. Conversation is often hit and miss, and some TV shows are nearly impossible. Often I can hear, but not understand. With the HP aids, the improvement is immediate and obvious. Huge upgrade to amplifiers -- I tried the ""Higher Brand"" amplifiers as a stop-gap measure...waste of time! This HP works 10 times better. Decent App -- Customizing the sound via the app is simple and effective. I feel that the app will improve in later editions, perhaps adding some fine tuning. Excellent Bluetooth -- The sound quality for listening to music, movies, podcasts, phone calls etc. is excellent. HP - Hearing PRO Self-Fitting OTC Hearing Aid obviously gave this plenty of emphasis, which is why I waited for these to become available. I really wanted an effective hearing aid that also had exceptional bluetooth capability. Simple to use -- The controls are minimal, limited to volume and focus via the app, and tap control on the left HP for phone calls. Stays in ear -- I haven't run while using the HPs, but they have stayed firmly in place throughout miscellaneous household activity and yard work. Reasonable price -- It's too soon for final judgement, but at the moment, these seem to be the best bang for the buck."
14,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Great Hardware - App and Controls too Simple,"The HP Hearing Pro is an over-the-counter (OTC) self-fitting hearing aid solution. I have some mild to moderate hearing loss in my upper ranges that impacts my ability to hear conversations in noisier environments. I also suffer from tinnitus which can crowded out the higher range sounds in quiet environments as well. I was excited with the new slate of OTC hearing devices, and I was especially interested in this set from HP due to its earbud-like design. I currently have a set of Lexie B1’s which looks more like a traditional hearing aid, so I am familiar with an OTC hearing solution.

I went through the setup and pairing of the Pro’s. You start by downloading the app and then following the prompts. I am on Android (Pixel 7 Pro) and had zero issues with the setup. You need to test fit the buds to make sure you have a good seal – they come with a medium eartip pre-installed but there is are large and small tip as well. With the medium tip I had good fitment and comfort. I went through the EarID program which helps to configure the Pro’s to match your specific hearing needs. You need about 10 minutes in a silent room with no distractions to complete this. Once completed they are ready to go.

As far as use and comfort goes the Pro’s were a nice fit for me. I could wear them for several hours without any discomfort. They wore fairly similar to my various earbuds, so that is a plus. The Pro’s rely on the different ridges/contours of your ear to wedge into place and stay there. I would caution anyone with very small ears though as these may be too large. My girlfriend, who struggles to find earbuds that are compact enough, found them to not fit comfortably even with the small ear tip. The battery life on the buds is only about 8 hours, so you may not get you through a full day without topping them off partway through. However, the case provides a couple of charges worth of power, so you can find a way around a really long day if need be. The case also charges via USB-C which I was happy to see. 

Sound quality of the mics and reproduction in the buds works well. I wore them out and about for errands, in a busy restaurant, the office, and even to the movies. I really liked the focus setting for the restaurant. It made it a lot easier to concentrate on my conversation with my girlfriend vs. the noise coming from the tables behind us. I used to regularly lose some of the conversation in these situations, so I found some improvement here. While out walking my dog the mics did a decent job of not picking up too much on the wind noise and amplifying that over the regular outdoor noise. I could hear the sounds of the outdoor sounds more clearly. In some cases, like bird calls, I could actually hear them whereas before I would not be able to discern their calls over the tinnitus. While watching TV they helped enough to bump up the vocals, which I struggle with sometimes if there’s too much ambient noise. 

The Pro’s also double as earbuds for listening to music or taking calls. The only on-bud controls are to answer or hang up a call. Sound quality through the buds for music is great. They have a great seal in my ear so the bass is punchy and full. They are some of the better sounding buds I have at my disposal. 

The app is pretty straightforward and simple. There are only a couple of things you can mess with in the app. Adjust the world volume up/down/off, turn on focus mode, or turn off/recalibrate your EarID. 

I do have some concerns and dislikes with the Pro’s. My biggest concern is how little you can control things. In many ways the app is too simple. It works well but I feel there should be some user customization. There are no manual adjustments or tweaks to the EarID, and no ability to have a couple of listening profiles. What I want to hear in a conversation doesn’t necessarily translate to what I want to hear from listening to music in my car or watching a movie. My EarID pumps up the higher range sounds, but then it feels like it flattens out the bottom end. This made something like seeing the new Guardians of the Galaxy in theaters less than satisfying. I had no problem hearing the dialogue, but at the sacrifice of the overall sound experience. If I could adjust the EarID EQ I could overcome this limitation, and bring forth a fuller sound experience while still boosting the deficient areas. I wish there were different hearing profiles to toggle between where you can manually adjust EQ’s. Right now it sounds like my hearing EQ leans towards conversation help, which isn’t great for the more dynamic sound fields of music and TV/movies. 

Also, the lack on controls on the earbuds is unfortunate. Clearly the controls can exist because there are tap controls for answering/hanging up a call. I should be able to tap on the buds to increase/decrease the world volume as hearing environments can be pretty variable. Or be able to tap them in a way that toggles the focus mode on or off. These are things they should have been able to do. Instead, you have to crack open the app to toggle/adjust these things, which makes the Pro’s less seamlessly integrated into day-to-day life. I want to pop the buds on and not touch my phone unless it’s for something complicated – not to move the world volume from 3 to 4.

The last thing I don’t care for is the need to have both buds in. None of my earbuds from the last several years have required both to be in my ear to use. My left ear is mostly within a normal hearing range, and doesn’t really need the boost that my right ear does. I would like to be able to just wear the right one sometimes. The Pro’s having this functionality could also help those that need a longer run time. You could foreseeably wear one bud, while the other charges in the case and then swap them out. This would be preferable to losing all hearing assistance while both buds charge in the case.

I do have several concerns, which seem like features that should be added with a software update, there are other things that I like that are inherent to the design. Being in my mid 30’s I feel the stigma (likely self-imposed) of needing help with hearing. With my Lexie B1’s, which are fairly inconspicuous I still felt some embarrassment because they look like a traditional hearing aid. With the HP Pro’s, I don’t get that same feeling. I am used to walking around work/home/in public with earbuds in for calls or music. Earbuds are worn everywhere nowadays, and nobody bats an eye about it. It’s something I am already comfortable with, and I get the impression that no one would question that I am using these buds to aid my hearing deficit. The other thing I really like is that these are rechargeable. I don’t like the need to swap out batteries and the waste involved with that practice. 
Overall, I have found the HP Pro Hearing Aids to be a solidly made product. They are very simple to setup, perform their task well, and have the benefit of being rechargeable. There are some downsides to the simplicity, which seems to hold the Pro’s back. If the sound profile could be customized, and more on-bud controls allowed these would be a clear pick. Right now, missing those features holds the Pro’s back a bit."
14,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,"For the right person, these are very nice","On the one hand, if you see what you’re getting in-person and it’s what you want, then it may work for you, as the quality is quite good. If you’re ordering sight-unseen, then I suspect you may be a bit surprised at the size. Overall, though, they work well under the right circumstances.

I have unilateral hearing loss, i.e., loss of hearing in one ear. I wear a hearing aid in this ear most all the time. This condition impacts how useful some products are for me. As unilateral hearing loss can indicate a very serious condition, no hearing aids should be fitted until a medical exam has ruled out the serious underlying causes. We’ll circle back to this later.

The first thing you’ll notice when you unbox the HP Hearing Pro is that they look like earbuds, and rather large earbuds at that. The upside is that it doesn’t look like you’re wearing a hearing aid. The downside is that you’ll always look like the person who is listening to music and not paying attention. If you need hearing aids, you’ll want to wear them when you’re talking with people, in a meeting, a restaurant, etc. - and you’ll always look like you’re too disinterest to pay attention. This is what I mean by seeing what you’re getting in person. Know what you’re getting (the photo below shows the HP Hearing Pro next to Sony OTC and Widex professional hearing aids).

The HPs come with Comply foam ear tips, which I really appreciate. When I get a new pair of earbuds, the first thing I do is see if Comply makes compatible tips. They are comfortable to wear, even for long periods, and they do an excellent job of blocking out external sounds. There are multiple sizes of both Comply and silicone tips to choose from, and you first need to select the ones that fit best for you. 

The next thing to do is install the HP Hearing app on your phone. This app is simple enough to use and guides you through the entire setup process. Once you’ve selected the proper tips, you connect the HP Hearing Pro to your phone via Bluetooth, a straightforward process. The app will then give you a simple hearing test. Unlike some other OTC hearing aids I’ve tested, this test was consistent and reflected my hearing loss quite well. What the app really should have done at this point was alert me that my hearing loss pattern was unusual and indicated the need for a medical exam to determine the cause, but it did not. This is a major oversight.

The HP Hearing Pro, like other bud-style hearing aids, can function as earbuds. You can take phone calls, listen to music, etc., with them in place, and they sound quite good. The Comply tips really help here, providing a sealed environment with no audio leaking. You can hear external sounds, amplified to match your hearing loss, and when you turn off the audio source they immediately function as hearing aids.

The audio quality as hearing aids is also quite good provided that, as advertised, you have mild to moderate hearing loss. I was able to clearly hear sounds quite well and make out most speech in my bad ear, even though my hearing loss is on the worse end of that spectrum. The HP Hearing Pro sound much better than some more expensive units I’ve tried. The frequency amplification matches my hearing loss and they have good clarity across the range.

Unfortunately, they don’t work at all if you only want to wear a single hearing aid. When either side is removed, the remaining unit shuts off right away. In my case, since I only need one hearing aid, this creates a problem in a lot of situations.

If you’re looking for an easy to use, clear sounding hearing aid, you don’t mind the earbud look, and you have a reason to wear both units, this is an excellent choice."
14,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Effective Hearing Assistance; Easy and  Flexible,"HP - Hearing PRO Self-Fitting OTC Hearing Aids
The HP Hearing Aid Pro delivers very successfully on the promise of hearing assistance. Setup was a breeze. Connections are reliable. Ongoing, everyday control is easy, but the App is required. And, of special interest to music lovers, the HP Hearing Pro takes sound quality up a giant step. These may be the very best audio earbuds I’ve ever used. 

We’ve been reading about the promised Over The Counter (OTC) hearing devices for a few years. I have tried and still use the earlier version of these Hearing Assistive device under the NuHeara name and these HP Hearing PROare a SIGNIFICANT improvement in a number of ways. Every complaint I had with the IQbuds is addressed satisfactorily. The HP PRO deliver on many of these promises for those of us with modest hearing impairments. I found the HP Hearing PRO device itself is reasonably small and discreet, jammed with medical-grade audio technology, and comfortable for lengthy listening sessions. Let’s talk about size for a second. Yes, they are full sized earbuds. Not very subtle. But, are they more objectionable than the highly regarded earbuds that look like Q-tips dangling from your ears? Each to their own opinion, but I wear these to my physical therapy and outdoor activities where I can now hear everything and enjoy music. 

The software offers customization features and simplicity. The nondescript earbuds deliver 2 sets of features that fulfill our desire for nice audio listening experience as well as corrective hearing benefits.  Both my wife and I are taking turns using them. At our age, we also take turns denying our hearing is waning. The HP Hearing Pro offers an interesting, and very effective solution to the hearing loss we insist we don’t have. Our experience follows.

SETUP: The Hearing PRO have rechargeable batteries, and are recharging whenever you place them into their carry case. The charge should last as long as 8 hours with the Li-ion batteries. The package includes a large collection of eartips which are easily swapped onto the earbuds. There are sets of flexible silicon tips in various sizes, and my favorite “memory foam” tips which are soft, solid foam which you squeeze to place into your ears where they expand for a secure but comfortable fit. Try the foam if you haven’t found a comfortable fit, yet.

With the (easy) connection to Bluetooth, we were ready to take the hearing test (HP calls it EAR ID) which customizes the ear buds for each end user. 
It begins with Noise Level (checking your setup environment for sufficient quiet levels), asks about your Better Ear, provides a series of TEST TONES to help you find the best EAR TIP to use, and finally you receive a complete Hearing Assessment which finishes with About You.

EAR ID tests for hearing deficiencies and creates compensating adjustments which are applied to what I’m hearing using the earbuds WHEN EAR ID is enabled. EAR ID modification is accessible independently on the EAR ID App TAB. It allows me to use these earbuds with those enhancements turned ON or OFF. As expected, my hearing ability is more limited in one year more than the other in the treble region and both ears have slightly reduced sensitivity to the bass tones. Now that the Hearing App knows my hearing deficiencies it applies corrections to all sounds entering the HP PRO microphones whether I’m in the Focus Mode (forward sounds emphasized) or World (full 360 degree listening). I don’t sense that these modifications are applied to my music sources.

SPECIAL NOTE for Music Lovers: When you have the HP Pro in your ears, with a music sources turned on, these are simply astounding earbuds. WITH WORLD VOLUME OFF, these ear buds become straight forward audio earbuds with FULL Active Noise Reduction. Sound quality in this mode is not modified. Rich detail, great bass, and sound quality that matched any earbuds I’ve owned. The iPhone Volume controls the level of music, while having no effect on hearing assistance afforded by the HP Pro. With World Volume turned ON, you can vary the noise reduction and enhance or turn off any sound modifications to sound entering the earbud microphones. So, you can listen to unmodified music while bringing in enhanced voices or other noises in the background. Your choice. 

Used simply as a hearing assistance tool, the World Volume ON setting enables the microphones on the HP Pro. Adjusting the level acts like a variable noise reduction or, as you increase the level, an environmental sound enhancement. Turning World Volume OFF enables the VERY effective noise reduction. 
FOCUS emphasizes sounds coming from directly in front of me. It seems to more emphatically modify voices sometimes resulting in more electronic sounding artifacts added to the sound. When listening to music I always turn FOCUS off, unless hearing voices is my environment is important to me. Simply using WORLD VOLUME offers a very natural improvement to sounds I often struggle with.
Handling the HP PRO while inserting or adjusting them resulted in only VERY rare squeals. Squealing is simply not an issue.  
Phone Calls are managed with presses on the Ear Bud shell. Sound quality is excellent for parties at either end of the call.

SUMMARY of Hearings Assistance FEATURES (A): These earbuds are FDA approved OTC hearing aids with a suite of phone-based tools allowing the end-user to fine tune their earbuds by performing hearing tests and several sound modifications to address individual hearing deficiencies. Significant changes are made to sounds but they can be modified by rerunning the Ear ID or easily understandable controls.

FEATURES (B) that Audiophiles will focus on: Effective Active Noise cancelling, highly accurate music presentation, they look like earbuds and not hearing aids, for Android and iOS. Sound quality is outstanding.

CONCLUSION: HP’s Hearing PRO can serve successfully in the world of medical assistive devices while also satisfying those who want to have a satisfactory high fidelity audio experience. The hearing assistance should be considered by those  who are troubled by mild hearing loss. No medical support is provided and should not be needed to prepare these for each individual’s customization. We accomplished it in several minutes.  I can share these with my wife, and we each can and should re-run the fine-tuning application which we both have installed on our iPhones. We both found these comfortable for long listening sessions. Our own sense of how “big and obvious “ these appear to others is very different than what we’ve read. We just don’t care what others think about our ear wear which are hardly any more noticeable than other earbuds on the market. We are enjoying these and using them as needed,"

HP - Hearing PRO Self-Fitting OTC Hearing Aids

This is my second shot at over-the-counter (OTC) hearing aids. I’m really liking them better than the smaller, in-the-ear type. They look more like ear buds for listening to music, but more importantly, for someone with arthritis, they’re much easier to pick up and insert into your ear.

I do not have to turn them on — that happens automatically when I take them out of the case. I do not have to remove or insert tiny batteries — they are rechargeable. They are very easy to hold and insert in my ears.

They come with silicone AND compressing foam tips in three sizes, so it was easy to custom fit them to my ears and preferences. The instructions mention that you may need to use different sizes for each ear and that’s exactly what I found. The hearing aids come fitted with the medium silicone tips, which are a great start. Once I set them up, I noticed whistling in my left ear which immediately stopped when I swapped the medium for a large tip.

I thought the silicone tips were very comfortable, but then I tried the foam ones and found they were even better. They’re not open-cell foam, but rather, the closed-cell foam like you find in hearing protection ear plugs. They compress easily when you insert them and then gently expand a bit to make a good seal while still being very comfortable.  

I downloaded the HP Hearing app and found it straightforward and easy to use. Pairing with Bluetooth was quick, and the hearing test that customized the hearing aids for me took about ten minutes. I was impressed with the simple interface and controls. 

After I completed the test, which should certainly be done somewhere quiet, I was able to set the “World Volume” up or down from normal, based on the situation. I was pleasantly surprised to find that when I turned up the volume, there was no feedback and I could hear a clock ticking in the other room! I can also change to “Focus” mode, which helps with face-to-face conversation.

Since the aids use Bluetooth, I can use any streaming services that support that to listen to music, TV, or to take phone calls. I think this is one of the great strengths of these aids! If you have a mild or moderate hearing loss, understanding someone on the phone can be difficult. Getting phone reception through the hearing aids is a game changer for me. 

My next favorite feature is that they’re rechargeable: no fussing with batteries, they last up to 8 hours on a charge, and putting them back in the case lets you get a bonus recharge on the go. The case is easy to pick up and put in your pocket or purse."
14,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Good Hearing Aids,"These are good hearing aids and do everything you want them to do. Blue tooth and answer calls, streaming, tv watching. the fit is good for an in the ear hearing aid and just look like a pair of earbuds. As a wearer of hearing aids every day I find the very comfortable and good in comparison with my more expensive pair. The app is good for setting them, up but I believe I have found a flaw inside the setup of the hearing aids in that app. I tried 3 different ways to set up the hearing aids. 1st was right ear then left ear and when doing the left ear I was told I missed a sound and then went on to complete it. Next I tried the left ear first and again on the second ear test I was told by the app i missed a tone. Then I let the app which ear to start with and again in the app on the second ear I missed a tone. This in its self seems to be the only Issues I have encountered in using the HP Hearing aids. Over all I love them and only wish they had a longer time over the 8 Hrs before recharge."
14,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"Best hearing aids for music and phone, 8 hour life","HP Hearing PRO

You might not know that HP makes hearing aids (and well, they don't...) but they've partnered with Nuheara one of the newer players in the hearing aid space to create the HP Hearing PRO OTC hearing aids.

Yes, they do look identical to the Nuheara IQBuds Max, but HP is making these more easily accessible to customers via stores like Best Buy.

Though Nuheara is a relatively young company, they have won awards and their products typically get good ratings.


Unboxing and initial thoughts
==================================
Opening the box, you'll see a nice large case with the HP logo on it. Those are the earbuds inside a charging case. Though the case is large, you get 3 charges out of it and the HP Hearing PROs are rated at 8 hours of battery life.

Inside the rest of the box, you'll see a sleeve with instructions and a quick start guide. You'll also get a load of different eartips (getting the right fit is crucial!) a charging cable, and cleaning tool.

The HP Hearing PROs look very much like ""standard"" wireless ear buds which is a nice thing since you may not want them to actually look like hearing aids. They have a large, round body with an HP logo on it and small holes for the microphones. I actually like how they look but they are on the large side compared to things like Jabras, Sennheiser, or even Airpods (though there's no stem).


Initial setup and app
=================================
Pairing was a non-issue on Android. According to the quick start guide, just get the app from the Google Play Store and then follow the instructions. There are text and short animations/videos to guide you. This will get you right into the hearing test/fitment test that should take about 5 minutes as it plays various tones in both ears and you'll push a button when you hear the tone. You'll see your ""Ear ID"" afterwards which shows your hearing levels per hear.

The app will then walk you through how to control the various modes like ""World Volume"" to enable enhanced hearing and ""Focus"" to listen to sounds in front of you or all around. 


Enhanced sound and music
=================================
You'll instantly be treated to hearing all of the noises around you and learn to use the different modes to enhance your hearing or just listen to music. By the way, these are great for calls and music. Music sounds great with bright sounds and full midbass/voices. Unsurprisingly, voices also sound great and callers had no issues hearing me.

Hearing what's going on in the next room is no problem. Voices from TV are clear but watch out for nearby ""white noise"" like an air filter or other droning sounds. Those will also be amplified and ""Focus"" or 

I know there are some OTC hearing aids like the Lexie Lumens that are ""just"" hearing aids, but these can pull double-duty which is nice if you want to carry one less gadget. They are also less ""fussy"" than the small hearing aids that have delicate tubes and require non-rechargeable batteries.

One thing you'll notice I haven't discussed are on-bud controls. There aren't any! Everything is done via the app to keep things simple. If you have more than one pair of wireless earbuds, you'll know what I mean... the combinations of button presses to do various functions is different between brands so I don't mind the simplicity here if it means ""it just works"".

NOTE - you can only use both buds at the same time. As soon as you take one out, they will not work. I suppose that makes sense since these are hearing aids, but I know some people like to work with one at a time if their ears need a break. You won't be able to do that with these!


Battery life and final thoughts
=================================
Because these have a strong connection (proper Bluetooth, not Bluetooth LE) and powerful performance for music and calls, their battery life is less than some of their competitors. However at 6-8 hours of real world usage and 3 more charges in the case, these have enough power to last a full day and then some.  

I'd say these are a top pick if you have mild/moderate hearing loss and want something that will pull double-duty as hearing aids and a phone/music solution. There's no doubt that these are some of the best hearing aids if you want to combine music listening and taking calls.

I think if you need more battery life, you could go with something like the Sony CRE-E10 or the Jabra Enhance Plus."
14,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,The hearing aids earbuds,"I honestly had no idea HP was into hearing aids until I heard of these. The HP Hearing Pro are very well made hearing aids. It came in nicely packed. They don’t look like traditional hearing aids, they actually look like earbuds. Some may not like the design as they are not discrete and they are kind of bulky for hearing aids. I get the idea maybe to disguise them since you can actually use them to listen to music. Is like getting two in one. They are big but not heavy and they are comfortable for the most part. To set them up it's easy, just download the HP Hearing app then pair your device. Before using them the app will guide you through a hearing test setup similar to what you get at the doctor’s office. I really like that because it adjusts the amplification of the frequencies you can’t hear. There is a section in the app that will give you an idea pretty much where your hearing levels are, and the type of sound you are deficient in. I will say it is accurate because I already knew where my deficiency was and the app pretty much nailed it. 

These hearing aids come with a few sets of ear tips. There are 3 pairs of round silicone tips and 3 pairs of foam tips. Both come in three sizes from small to large for a total of 6 ear tips. Either one of the ear tips is capable of creating a nice seal to isolate outside noise. When it comes to sound they do the job verywell. I was able to hear all kinds of sounds including those high frequencies I have a hard time with. The sounds were perfectly clear. Another feature where these hearing aids shine is the noise canceling. That noise canceling is on par with some of the best I have tested. When it comes to music these won’t let you down. They sound great and with an outstanding bass. I also like how you can listen to music and hear the outside noise at the same time.

There are many features that come with this device. You can even make phone calls and with the left earbud you can tap to accept or reject the calls. The quality of the calls were very good too. An area where I was not impressed was with the focus option, I actually hear less with that feature on compared to having it off. The battery life is rated to 8hrs for normal use and 5hrs for constant music listening. The carrying case also charges your device and it gives an additional 16hrs. You charge the case using the included USBC cable. 

Overall these hearing aids are true all around device, by far one of the best over the counter I have tested. They not only performed great when it comes to hearing but also listened to music. It comes with plenty of features and can be used as earbuds. With the 8hrs battery life and the additional 16 in the carrying case will get you through the day no problem. In the box you get the hearing aids, carrying case, USBC cable, 6 pairs of ear tips, cleaning brush and carrying bag."
14,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Finally ! Bluetooth Calling and Music + Speech !,"First Impressions - After unpacking the box, I noted the headphones nicely packed in the included charging case. 
A complete accessory set is also included with a cleaning brush, multiple size ear tips and a soft carry case for
everything. I proceeded to charge these up overnight to make sure I was starting with a full charging case. 

The app - I installed the app and waded through the initial setup and test. It appeared I was calibrated and 
ready to go within about 10 minutes. Notably you can control the ""world volume"", ""Focus"" ( ahead or behind ) and a 
few other aspects of overall boost and sound clarity levels within the app. These are all easily manipulated. 
I was able to find the sweet spot for live conversation as well as TV listening within a few seconds.

Overall performance - I used these on and off in different scenarions for most of a week. At a crowded resteraunt, at
home, while walking outside through woods and for numerous voice calls during the workday. The ability to tune them 
for focus and quickly reduce world volume performs well. Audio quality for calls and music is excellent.

Music and Movie sound ! - I feel it's important to call out that you CAN play music and calls through these. My 
""professional"" hearing aid ? No way. Another leading brand set I use daily ? No - can't do it with those either. 

Daily Use and comfort - Overall these are more comfortable than they may appear for the apparent size. I personally
would not want to wear these for 10+ hours. I consider myself lucky as I have almost perfect hearing in one ear and 
severe loss in the other. This allows me to use a set like this for occasional or as-needed use to enhance speech clarity - 
the area I suffer the most in. I am used to wearing full time when working on-site or spending a day out and 
about in noisy places.

Speech clarity - Comparing these to two other leading brands I have tried - For my situation they all work about equally
well. These provide a huge boost in speech clarity which is exactly what I need most of the time. HP gains huge points
from me for the bluetooth connectivity for music and calls and for these just performing like a good set of wireless
headphones. I will be using this set heavily when on vacation and travelling as they are perfectly fit for my needs.

What I love:
Great speech boost performance + MUSIC AND CALLS !
They look like normal headphones !
Includes Charging Case 

Room for improvement:
Battery life - These won't run a full 10-12 hour day"
14,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Sign of good things to come!,"This tech is very inspiring. 
I'm  a long-time precsribed hearing aid wearer, so I was very excited about this item.
The features and price are extremely compelling.
I greatly enjoyed my time with them. The hearing test was intuitive, and sound enhancement (along with the streaming ) were exceptional. The only critique are the size and poor battery life..
When the manage to shrink the product and squeeze a day of usage out of the battery, ill be an ecstatic customer!"
14,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Great Sounding Hearing Aids With Streaming,"The HP Hearing Pro Self-Fitting Hearing Aids come with the hearing aids, charge case, USB-A to USB-C charge cable, carry bag, cleaning brush, both silicon and foam small, medium, and large tips.  The charge case is well made and feels solid, so I wasn't worried about keeping it in my pocket.  It's designed for ease of access inside the case and it's easy to insert and remove each hearing aid.  The hearing aids automatically begin to charge when inserted into the case and the charge indicators are very bright.

HP has an app that will allow you to run through a hearing test so it can setup a hearing profile for you.  Once that is done, you'll have access to features of the app.  Within the app you can set world volume and turn it on/off.  You also have the option to turn on focus which helps to cut out ambient sounds behind and to the sides so that sound forward of you is picked up better.  The app is also where you can check for firmware updates.

Connecting the Hearing Pro's is very simple and straight forward.  It can be done in less than a minute.  Once connected to your phone you will not only have the features found withing the app, but you can use the hearing aids for calls and streaming music.  Music and audio book playback sounds great.  To help reduce ambient noise when listening to music, audio books, or phone calls, you can turn off world volume which enables noise canceling.  This works well inside and outside, but doesn't completely block out external sounds.

As far as fit and comfort, I've worn these for many hours at a time and at no point where the uncomfortable to wear.  The medium tips fit me well were comfortable.  It would be nice to see a smaller version of these in the future.  

In my use of these, I did experience a strange issue when outdoors where if the volume of world sound was a little high, the hearing aids seemed to cut out world sound for a few seconds then turn it back on for a few seconds and back and forth, but this didn't happen under normal circumstances.  This would be something that HP can address in a firmware update.  The audio quality of music is really good, so no issues there and no issue with the hearing aids staying connected.  The controls on the hearing aids themselves is limited to the left hearing being used to answer/end calls.  I would like to see music controls added in the next version of these.  I like these and will be looking forward to see what HP can do with the next iteration.  I would recommend considering these as a possible option for someone looking for hearing aids that allow you to stream music, audio books, and phone calls while still performing quite well as hearing aids."
14,BestBuy,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,Medical,Sound adjustment good.  Too bulkey for your ear.  The left device cracked within 48 hrs of purchase.  Setup was easy.
14,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Great quality sound and convenience of Bluetooth!,"The HP Hearing PRO Self-fitting hearing aids are a phenomenal choice for those who are hard of hearing but don't like the look, fit, feel, and headphone/earbud limitations of traditional hearing aids. The latter is one of the greatest benefits that these hearing aids offer, you can use them as your Bluetooth listening device for music! This is fantastic as it integrates two primary things I like to use my ears for, listening to music and being able to hear people! I previously relied on earbuds that have an ambient mode, which usually works just okay for people with good hearing and bad to dangerous for those with limited hearing. After getting my first pair of hearing aids, they were the traditional type with the bulk of the device behind ears and no ability to use earbuds with them. These solve that problem by combining the devices and doing so in a sleek, rechargeable package!

The look and sound quality are excellent, the battery life is great (around 8 continuous hours of listening to music and coworkers in the office), and size of the charging case is fantastically compact! You can throw these in your pocket at the start of the day and use them when you need them, or leave them in your ears all day with comfort! I highly recommend, especially at this price point!"

14,BestBuy,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,For me they are not the right answer,"I've worn hearing aids for a number of years - always behind the ear configuration. I had high hopes for these but for me they do not work. The sound was improved some from my current hearing aids and I loved the phone call streaming. The HP aids, though, are very uncomfortable - too heavy - even after two weeks of wearing 6 or more hours each day the pain remained too much to bear to consider keeping for the long-term. I also had significant difficulty maintaining the seal in the right ear. I tried all of the ear tips - silicone and foam. These aids require a seal in the ear canal or there is feedback - at times I could not get the right ear to seal without annoying intermittent feedback. I also had trouble outside when in windy situations - the hearing aids would intermittently cut out for 30 seconds at a time. Also note that these hearing aids are quite large and  some will be unwilling to accept the way they look when worn. The interface with my android phone worked well and the initital setup was easy and the bluetooth pairing consistently worked."

14,BestBuy,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,Disappointing Customer Service,"I've had my hearing aids two days and the right one isn't working at all. I can't pair/unpair, there's no sound, nothing. I called HP and had to leave a voice mail. I also emailed them and haven't even gotten the usual canned ""We'll respond asap"" response. This is very disappointing for such an expensive item."
14,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,"A lot to love, but...","For now, I'm rating these at 4 stars. If HP ads a little fine tuning to the app, I would lean toward 5 stars. Here's why...

Pros

Better hearing --  I have significant, though not devastating, hearing loss. Conversation is often hit and miss, and some TV shows are nearly impossible. Often I can hear, but not understand. With the HP aids, the improvement is immediate and obvious. 

Huge upgrade to amplifiers  --  I tried the $200 amplifiers as a stop-gap measure...waste of time! The HP cost 4 times more and works 10 times better.

Decent App  --  Customizing the sound via the app is simple and effective. I feel that the app will improve in later editions, perhaps adding some fine tuning.

Excellent Bluetooth  --  The sound quality for listening to music, movies, podcasts, phone calls etc. is excellent. HP/Nuheara obviously gave this plenty of emphasis, which is why I waited for these to become available. I really wanted an effective hearing aid that also had exceptional bluetooth capability.

Simple to use  --  The controls are minimal, limited to volume and focus via the app, and tap control on the left HP for phone calls.

Stays in ear --  I haven't run while using the HPs, but they have stayed firmly in place throughout miscellaneous household activity and yard work.

Reasonable price  --  It's too soon for final judgement, but at the moment, these seem to be the best bang for the buck.

Cons

Appearance  --  yes, they are not small, and do protrude a little more than my ""regular"" earbuds. That's the price you pay for a lot of technology and bluetooth excellence crammed into a small package. 

Uncomfortable  --  After 9 days of trying, I have not yet discovered the secret to wearing these comfortably. After about an hour, they begin to be a little uncomfortable, gradually progressing to the point of pain by the end of 3 hours. Slightly twisting the HPs helps temporarily, but you cannot twist them very far or they start squealing. I have tried all the tips -- but it is not the tip that's uncomfortable, it's the body. In other words, the discomfort is not in the ear canal. I'm hoping that my ears will get tougher over time...before the 60 day trial ends.

In summary, there's a lot to like about the HPs. I will give it another month and then decide if the discomfort has improved enough to keep them. I think some others are wearing them without discomfort, and I would think they must be very pleased with this product."
14,BestBuy,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,Hp hearing pros,"Good sound quality, but won't keep a charge long.  It also loses Bluetooth connection sometimes."
14,BestBuy,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,Defective,"Had to return them because they only worked one day, and would not work after that. Worked really well that one day. Too bad they were defective. My husband did not want to try them anymore."
14,BestBuy,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,HP - Hearing Pro - Not very helpfu as hearing aids,"I purchased the HP - Hearing Pro and as a promotion, a free pair of the Nuheara - IQbuds 2 MAX Personal Hearing Amplifier.  For my particular hearing challenges, neither pair were very helpful.  In most environments, I was able to hear voices more clearly without the hearing aids.  I would not be able to recommend either as a hearing aid.  That being said, the Nuhera IQbuds were much better ear buds and offered much more control through the associated app.  For use as ear buds, the Nuhera IQbuds were very good but are also very expensive.  There are better ear buds for a better price."
14,BestBuy,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,"Hearing Aid A+, Bug Issue D-","I'll make this simple. As for a hearing aid, they work fantastic except in wind. They keep shutting the sound off drastically. Makes sense but they should ramp down some.

There is a bug with them though. I bought 2 pair. 1st out of the box the ""Connected/Disconnected"" voice, music playback and phone call was distorted, staticky. Returned and had another pair the next day. 2nd pair not issues everything was working great till day 3. Same issue. Emailed support and the only option was to return.

Do note, sometimes putting them back in the case would cycle their power and would fix it, but the next time/day I go to use them, same issue. The issue didn't matter if they were connected via BT or not, didn't matter which phone they were connect to either. There is a bug, hopefully they can get it fixed.

I really liked them but I am trying another version of them."
14,BestBuy,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Good - for the brief time they worked.,"These worked wonderfully... for one day. Then they wouldn't turn on, even though when I put them in the charging case, the light showed green (fully charged). There is no manual switch or reset button - you can only put them in the charging case (which is supposed to automatically turn them off), then take them back on, which should turn them on.

I tried contacting their tech support. Phone call got me ""no representatives are available, please leave a message."" Email got ""we will try to get back to you in 24 to 48 hours."" It seems HP has licensed these from Nuheara, which is based in Australia... and thus 12 hours ahead of me here in US Eastern time, making phone support difficult.

I brought them back to Best Buy and exchanged them for another pair. Those also worked for one day and then quit. 52 hours after my original email, the support got back to me... to ask me the serial number and where I bought them. I sent that back, and they sent me the same instructions as in the manual, just written out step-by-step. 

Ultimately, I decided to return these and get another brand, which I am using now. They've been working fine for four days now.

It's a pity, really - the HP hearing aids were less expensive, and did a very good job while they worked. Looking at other reviews, though, it seems other people have also experienced them failing very soon after purchase. If they can fix that, and maybe get some US-based support so it's possible for their US customers to reach support during normal daytime hours, that would fix the issues I had, but as it is, I can't recommend them."
14,BestBuy,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Good while they worked,"I purchased these on 5/16/23 and on the morning of the 17th they were dead; wouldn't connect to the smartphone app or turn on.  I contacted HP customer service and was told to exchange these at BestBuy which I did on 5/18/23.  Now on 5/30/23 the second set is DOA just as the first set.  HP Customer service says they are becoming aware of a problem and are working on it, have a nice day.  That's not a good answer as far as I'm concerned.  They're great while they work but two sets in under a month bad is a bit much!"
14,BestBuy,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,DON’T BOTHER,"The right hearing aid quit after 2 days. Contacted Nuheara on Nov 1st. Very slow response. I purchased these and had them delivered through Best Buy on October 28th. After the usual stupid and useless troubleshooting, they either work or they don’t. End of. I was told they have to go to Nuheara in Kentucky. It took far too long to get a return authorization. I returned the pair on Nov 17th. I was told that once my shipment is in transit, my new pair will be shipped. No, they did not do anything until Nov 22nd, the day they arrived at Nuheara. On Nov 24th a label was created according to Fed Ex. Nov 26th, still sitting at Fed Ex in Kentucky. I have kept Nuheara informed of the situation at Fed Ex. Now it is Dec 1st and Fed Ex says the order is still at the FE location in Kentucky and there is no delivery date. A waste of 7 days in getting the replacements. I have no idea when they will arrive as FE doesn’t know either. Nuheara has not been helpful or concerned about the situation. Today I told them to give me a darn refund and keep the darn things! Nuheara, as a good faith gesture should have shipped the replacements via second day air. For all I know they might be coming by bicycle, if they’ve moved at all. I’m in California. If your gut feeling is the product and the company are unreliable, please do not talk yourself into buying them anyway! At one point it took 6 days for an email response from Nuheara. It’s been 34 days since I purchased this product. I have nothing except a lot of aggravation and a BB payment coming due, for a product I don’t even have!"

Affordable, convenient, easy to setup and highly functional"
182,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Professional Hearing Aids On Line/Virtually,"After an illness in 2021, I found myself increasingly needing hearing assistance. I got very tired of asking whom I was with to repeat what they just said, and I am sure they got tired of me asking. I had purchased my father some fairly small behind-the-ear hearing aids with receiver wires in the last couple of years of his life. I was fairly familiar with how light and comfortable hearing aids had become, but I was not ready to go there yet. When the FDA began to regulate OTC (over-the-counter) hearing amplifiers, I started my hearing loss journey with a pair of Personal Sound Amplification Products (PSAP). The FDA regulates hearing aids, but they classified PSAPs as consumer electronics and not medical devices. I soon discovered a lot of variables in the PSAP devices and the differences between them and actual hearing aids. Upon using my initial pair, I found a lot of technological interference with the ones I started using. I soon put them back in the box and into the drawer, abandoning them forever because the screeching sound was much worse than the hearing loss. 

After a few months, a more advanced pair of PSAPs came on the market. With this pair, I had no major interference from appliances and devices sending signals through the electromagnetic fields or deafening screeching sounds. Instead, I had a different issue with using them that I found annoying. Even though that pair had earpiece modifications of diverse sizes, they still irritated my ear canal and did not want to stay in it very well, often dislodging and falling out. They also irritated my inner ears, and I wanted to remove them to deal with the skin irritation they caused. That pair had Bluetooth and worked with my iPhone, which was a technological advancement for me, but the irritation also caused that pair to be forgotten. 

After a year of trial and error, I have finally found a hearing aid that feels like a 'winner' to me. The Jabra Enhanced Select 500, a product similar in style to the pair I had purchased for my father, has become my go-to solution. The design of the Select 500 Hearing Aids has been perfected to mitigate or alleviate the issues that earlier OTC hearing devices had, and the company has designed some wonderful features for and into this product. It is a relief to have found a solution that works for me. 

The Jabra Enhanced Select 500 has many excellent features, but the features that make this product so appealing include 1. the quality of the product’s design, materials, and sound, 2. the ability to recharge the hearing aids in their own case up to three (3) times, 3. the light fit, ease of changing the receiver lines, and numerous opportunities to find the exact fit to result in function and comfort for each of my two ear canals, 4. numerous online videos for just about any question that I have had, and 5. having a care team with a licensed audiologist to help me stay on track in becoming accustomed to and using the hearing aids. 

These are real hearing aids, and the difference is that they are designed specifically to work with hearing impairments and amplify various frequencies as they are individually needed for every person wearing and using the Select 500 Hearing Aids. Jabra has made excellent music and audio earbuds for the past few years, and the company has perfected the technology of reducing unwanted background noise, enhancing speech, and tailoring their results to enhance different environments--from restaurants to outside areas to lecture halls. The Bluetooth is identical to other retail hearing aids, if not more enhanced by their proven success with their continuously developed earbuds. These are also not analog hearing aids but digital hearing aids, and they are designed to connect through Bluetooth with smartphones to allow the flexibility to make individual adjustments in real time using the phone (iPhone or Android). 

For example, if I am in a noisy, crowded restaurant, I can use the Jabra Enhance Select app and instantly change my setting to the restaurant option and reduce all background noise so I can just hear the conversation at the table. I can also do this by the button on the hearing aid itself. There are other preselects for outdoors, all-around, and music, but even better, and to get to this point of perfection, I have already used telehealth with Jabra’s licensed audiologist and support staff to tailor the hearing aids specifically to my ears and degree of hearing loss. 

Each hearing aid has a microphone, a processor, an amplifier, and a receiver/speaker. There are online audiology tests, and Jabra’s audiologist and support staff can adjust settings remotely by sending customized settings individually to patients through the app, which can be uploaded as needed individually by patients/clients. If you have an audiology hearing test report, that report can be uploaded and used in each person’s individual file to help with any tweaking of perfecting and individualization of sound for each patient customer. Obtaining an audiologist test is often a free assessment at many hearing clinics. Still, many health and Medicare plans will pay for an audiologist exam yearly to ensure no inner ear damage is present. However, if this does not interest the patient/client, the hearing aids can be totally individualized based on the online hearing test and assessment by a care team licensed audiologist. For complete professional service with the Jabra Enhanced Select 500, I suggest all visits with the Jabra care team's licensed audiologist and an audiologist exam because it can help form the basis for total professionalization and individualization of the hearing aids. 

The hearing aid's components work together to analyze and amplify specific sounds for perfect hearing. The microphone receives the incoming sound, which is then digitized and converted into electronic signals. The signals are shaped, amplified, and delivered to the ear through the receiver/speaker wire. Telehealth communication visits became popular beginning in 2020 and are now fully recognized as medical visits covering many medical issues. The telehealth visit I have had with Jabra works similarly through Zoom which provides a one-on-one interaction with the audiologist. 

Jabra offers the option to just purchase the hearing aids or to purchase the hearing aids with a Premium Package which is well worth the cost of around $200 dollars. The Premium Package provides all the hearing online tests, telehealth visits with a licensed audiologist, and support care for three (3) years, three (3) years of Loss & Damage Protection for the hearing aids, and a three (3) year Warranty. To get started, my care team audiologist sent extra receiver lines individualized to my specific needs, and they arrived in three (3) days. Within the retail box, I received the charging case with charger and cable, a set of two (2) hearing aids, a user guide, extra domes for the ear canal end of the receiving lines, a cleaning cloth and brush, a wax filter kit, an ear measuring tool that determined the size of receiver lines I needed, a small tool to assist with changing the receiver lines, a kit of cards to assist with start-up, and a set of sport lock wires to help hold the aids in place when being active. 

Changing the receiver wires was easy and quick, and I just used my fingernail to make the adjustment. Everything about using these hearing aids has been smooth and easy, except for downloading the adjustments my care team audiologist sent through the app. She did so very timely and in a matter of minutes after our online telehealth first session. It took me a week to consistently access and download the settings to my hearing aids. I cannot help but think it was definitely a technological mishap that is not normal procedure because too much about every aspect of these hearing aids is top quality. Once the individualized settings were downloaded to my hearing aids, it was a smooth, quick process that enhanced my sound quality. 

I have a second telehealth visit with my care team audiologist this week. Since my audiologist report is almost four (4) years old and because I like these so well and realize their quality and design, I have scheduled a new audiologist test so that I can forward the results to my care team audiologist to be sure that I am getting the maximum potential of the design and sound quality of the Jabra Enhanced Select 500. Jabra has also designed and is marketing 300 and 200 models that all have the same foundational design as the Select 500 but come at a lower retail price. I am sure because of the quality of the Jabra Enhanced Select 500, they are also worth consideration. If you have arrived at that point where hearing is starting to be a noticeable issue, I hope you will consider the Jabra Enhanced Select 500 Hearing Aids. You will have one hundred (100) days to try them; if they are not for you, they can be returned. For me, I already feel confident that they are going to work fine and help me in social settings tremendously."
182,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,The best OTC hearing aids available,"I've suffered with some form of hearing loss for more than half my life. I've been diagnosed with Sensorineural Sloping Hearing Loss in both ears, which is the most common type of hearing loss. It occurs when the inner ear or the actual hearing nerve itself becomes damaged. Over the years, I've tried different types of hearing assistance -- everything from the most simple pre-programmed one-size-fits-all hearing aids to the most advanced premium hearing aids that can be programmed remotely and pair to smartphones. I am currently using a set from ReSound, which is owned by the GN Group, the parent company Jabra. I learned when I started using ReSound hearing aids about six years ago that the Jabra and ReSound engineers work side by side to ensure that users get the best possible listening experience no matter what product they are using. 

The Jabra Enhance Select 500 are a great set of OTC hearing aids and I'm extremely glad they are available. In my opinion, they are the next best thing to the premium prescription hearing aids people can get. I was able to set my two hearing aid sets next to each other and see the similarities in their features.

Unboxing and Setup

When I received the kit, I was in awe of everything that was included. In my pursuit of a decent, inexpensive hearing aid, I have used ones that are barely more than an amplifier and only comes with preset mode. This is what I was continuing to expect from other OTC hearing aids. The Jabra Enhance Select 500 was not that at all. The kit comes with the hearing aids, a charging case, wall charger and cable, several packets of ear domes, a cleaning kit, sport locks, a wax guard and receiver tool, and several manuals to follow. This was very similar to the kit I got with the ReSound hearing aids I have. 

Out of the box, the hearing aids did have some charge to them, but I would recommend charging them to 100% before setting them up and using them. The hearing aids come with the receiver wire installed and a set of domes already on the ends. They are lightweight and the charging case is very compact. It is, in fact, the same charging case as the ReSound ONE hearing aids I own. 

To set them up properly, you must download the Jabra Enhance Select app. I will point out that with iPhones, you can only have one hearing assistance device connected at a time. Since I already had the ReSound ONE hearing aids paired to my phone, I unpaired those so that I could set up the Enhance Select 500s. After I did, I went back into the ReSound app and it recognized the Jabra hearing aids. I didn't attempt to use that app with those hearing aids, but it was very interesting to see that happen given the relationship of the two companies to each other. 

The pairing process was fairly simple and they hearing aids stayed connected once they were recognized by the iPhone. After getting the devices paired, I was able to walk through the adjustment steps in the app to get the hearing aids set up. 

Remote Assistance

One of the huge benefits of using Jabra OTC hearing aids is the ability to use their remote assistance support personnel to get help with any issues you might have. I reached out to them when I was setting everything up. They walked me through the process and even explained why the two apps were so similar. The person I worked with was very knowledgeable and helpful to me. I also set up an appointment with an audiologist so that I can fine tune the hearing aids. 

Experience 

Nearly all of my high-end hearing is gone. I can't hear birds without assistance and it's very difficult for me to understand dialogue on televisions shows. The Jabra Enhance Select 500 hearing aids were able to elevate my hearing to a place where I could hear birds and dialogue was quite a bit easier to understand. There is still a difference between this level of OTC hearing aids and prescription hearing aids. The Enhance Select 500 are extremely comprehensive and a great OTC option for people with mild-moderate hearing loss. I would encourage everyone to get their hearing tested -- even if you think you don't have any issues. It gives you a baseline to judge future hearing tests from and the moment you start having issues, you don't have to wait. You can go get a set of OTC hearing aids so that you don't lose more hearing capacity. The Jabra Enhance Select 500 hearing aids are the best OTC option available."
182,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"What a difference, I was able to hear, now better","The Jabra Enhance Select 500 hearing aids are designed for people with mild-to-moderate hearing loss and they offer many benefits:

Right out of the box these hearing aids come with everything needed for a personalized and great fit. They come with left and right hearing aids, charging / carrying case, charging cord, AC wall plug, cleaning supplies and various ear domes.  And the tulip domes provide a good fit for improved audio with minimum leakage. 

They come with different numbered cards with the steps to follow from what to expect to enhance the sound. I found the application very useful, it helps to adjust sound, connect to customer support, and it also has helpful guides and videos on how to get the best of the Jabra Enhance. 

Also while unboxing and looking at them there is a phone number to call with any questions, the 8008542772 number is the Jabra enhanced phone line, and they have answers for current customers, as well as questions on purchasing, product adviser and finally technical support.  And at the technical support line, they were helpful with the questions I had.  Also the remote assistance and test process is much easier than I thought.  The hearing care professionals help remotely to fine tune the Jabra and I found the help superb.

I really like how they seat behind the ear and they are barely visible since they are very compact. 

Also something to like it’s the incorporation of Bluetooth, this feature makes it easy to make phone calls and listen to media on both Android and iOS devices without any other device. 

These aids offer a 116 dB input dynamic range. And the SoundScape technology enhances voices in noisy environments. It just sounds so much better with them than without. 

They charge in 30 minutes to get 8 hours of battery life and with 3 hours of charging time they give 30 hours of battery life.  And Best of all the lights indicate when they are fully charged. 

Overall the Jabra Enhance Select 500 are premium aids and they are simple to use and are customizable, they have a great battery life and they charge fast.  I can amazingly hear much better at work since there is always lots of people and it was hard to listen to the person in front of me, also listening to podcasts, music, computer or even my TV using Bluetooth is a big plus."
182,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Kudos to Jabra for superb OTC Hearing Aids,"These Jabra Enhance Select 500 hearing aids are spectacular in every regard. I have tried other OTC Hearing Aids, since OTC became available not too long ago, without much success… that is, until now! These are very small “micro” hearing aids that sit so comfortably behind my ears that I truly forget they are there. I have very short hair around my ears, yet they are still almost unnoticeable when speaking to someone - to the front and sides. Except for the small wire attached to the tiny in ear receiver leading into my ear canal. Of course, the best part is that I can now hear more clearly than I can remember! A note: these are recommended only for those with mild to moderate hearing loss.
Setup is so easy. A 3 hour charge of the portable charging case will charge the hearing aids for about 3 days of use. For me, they connected immediately upon removal from the case, but for best use and settings, you must download the Jabra Enhance Select app and pair them via bluetooth. Very specific instructions are included for each step and if more help is ever needed, you can contact Jabra via email, chat or their 800# 7 days a week.

After the initial setup, Jabra requests that you take their hearing test. I hear better in 1 ear than the other, so based on that test, they made adjustments which were sent to me via the app and I then applied to my hearing aids via settings. The adjustment was a bit too much, so they made another adjustment for me. I then had my initial virtual visit with their audiologist via Zoom. She went over my specific hearing and some health issues, and made notes and gave me suggestions to make sure I get the best possible results from these Jabra Enhance Select 500 hearing aids. She was friendly, compassionate and answered all of my questions fully. I was told that if I have a hearing exam from my own audiologist and forward those results to the Jabra Audiology Team, they can program my hearing aids according to those results. It is quite comforting to know that help like that is available to me for 3 years. 

I am now able to wear my hearing aids without issue and I am hearing great. I can hear the people at my table at a restaurant instead of all the noise around us; I can hear and understand the TV and don’t have to constantly ask ‘what did they say?’; and though I still find myself doing it occasionally, I am trying to read lips far less often. I am also able to stream music via bluetooth which is so convenient. I stream from my iPhone and yes, the sound could be better with actual headphones, but the sound from these hearing aids is perfectly acceptable for me. And I can answer my iPhone directly by double tapping. 

Jabra has thought of everything to make life with hearing aids easier and to that end, they have included several extra domes in different sizes, cleaning supplies, sport locks to help keep the hearing aids secure if needed while doing strenuous exercise, an extensive user guide and their outstanding customer service. 

For me, these Jabra Enhance Select 500 are a life-changer. To be able to hear clearly is incredible and something I never thought possible. To know that the Jabra Audiology Team and Jabra customer service is there for any needed support for 3 years is so comforting. I could not have made a better choice for an OTC hearing aid, I am sure of it! I would highly recommend these hearing aids to anyone: friends, family, acquaintances  - anyone in need of hearing assistance."
182,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Extremely comprehensive hearing aids!,"I am extremely surprised on how comprehensive this hearing aids are! I was expective just a simple volume booster or something like that, but no, these improve your hearing in every way. I will explain later.

They were extremely well packaged and came we nice instruction and numbered cards, taking you step by step in the process of getting them customized for your hearing. They include a nice carrying case (which also serves as a battery/charger for the earbuds), an AC power adaptor, an USB type C cable and several accessories (wax guard, cleaning brush, different ear pieces, an ear size measure).

Once you have them fully charged, the first step is to activate them using the included code and then you create a profile/account with them. This is the step that greatly surprised me. You schedule a video with a hearing specialist in a few days to better tune them, these people are real experts and highly knowledgeable. However you get started right away, after setting up that appointment you can also go through a comprehensive calibration step. I was on my computer so the screen guided me to use any headphones or earbuds I had (on this step you are not wearing the aids) and it presents you with different sounds at different levels and also at different HZ in the hearing spectrum. I was expecting it to be just a volume test, but no, its very comprehensive. After the test I told me I have mild hearing loss but mainly in the mid and high tones, this means its more difficult to hear consonants, wow!!! So it tunes your hearing aids and uploads that information to them. I was surprised to see they were not just volume boosters, but it identifies and tunes them according to what you are having issues with.

I also love the premium package and its worth it. You get the Enhance 500 charging case, 3 years of hearing care, 3 years of loss and damage protection, 3 years of warranty. This is very much a must, as hearing changes over the years and the older we get...

They can also be paired on your phone with the Jabra enhance app and you can use them to also receive phone calls, stream music and further fine tune them and also contact specialists should you need to fine tune them. I love how the app lets you also select different audio environments to further tune out noise and hear voices more clearly (like setting them in a restaurant in example). The in ear pieces are very comfortable and the back part blends very well and is not noticeable. If you have larger hair, even better. It takes a little bit to get used to them, they are not like glasses. I will keep tuning them and contacting Jabra's specialists in the future until I got them perfectly dialed down.

These are the complete package with lots of support from the company, I highly recommend them, you will not need any other hearing aids in the future! I can finally hear clearly the TV, movies, news and voices!!!"
182,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,So Much More Than Traditional Hearing Aids,"I have tried several different brands of hearing aids in the past. They have all been lacking in either comfort, hearing ability and even made my ears bleed.  The Jabra Enhance Select 500 is different. I have used these for about a week and a half now. They are so comfortable that I forget they are in my ears. Sometimes my ear will itch and I put my finger up to realize I have hearing aids in. These hearing aids come with a 3 year warranty that includes  an online hearing test and a virtual appointment with a Dr. All this is included in the package. I feel so confident that I have the best hearing that I can get with these hearing aids. 

I took the hearing test a day after I set up the hearing aids. I got immediate results and my results were also sent to the Dr who was going to take care of me personally. I learned where my hearing was lacking and just what I was not hearing due to my personal hearing loss. It was not a generic “Set the Hearing Aids and Go” kind of experience.  

I scheduled an appointment with the Dr specializing Audiology. Yes, this was also included with these hearing aids. The day came for my virtual visit and I learned so much. She went over how to use my hearing aids to maximize my personal needs. She sent an update to the APP that was adapted to my personal hearing test. The update was easy to install while I was talking to her. Then she ask how this new setting was and it was perfect. I feel so confident now that I can hear. I was missing out on so much. She was so polite and helpful. She answered all my questions and I did not feel rushed. I felt in control more than I have in years. I love that I now have a whole support system instead of just hearing aids. 

The Dr sent me some videos to teach me how to clean my hearing aids and care for them. She said if I need them adjusted at any time during the next 3 years just let them know. I can schedule another virtual visit with her at anytime as well. I have their phone number, email address and can schedule appointments on the APP. It is so simple. I can’t wait to get out in the world and not need to read lips to know what people are saying to me. 

Setting up the hearing Aids were so easy using the APP. I can easily adjust sound settings and volume using the APP or the buttons on the hearing aid itself. I love the videos that are included as well. 

These Jabra Enhance Select hearing aids are synced to my phone so I can listen to music or talk on the phone without ever taking them out. It is an amazing invention and I love them in every way. They come with a case that also serves as a charger for the hearing aids. The case will charge the hearing aids three times from dead to full strength before I need to recharge the case again. I do not need to worry about being away from home and my hearing aids going dead. The charger is included with the hearing aids. I think this is the first hearing aids that i have had that comes with the entire charger including the block. It also comes with several different kinds of domes. It has closed and open domes. Since I have had problems with bleeding in the past, she suggested I use the open dome. She checked the size of my ear to verify that I know and use the correct size and shape of the wire and dome. Included is a cleaning kit and Wax Guard with receiver tool. I had never heard of those and ask what they were. She explained what their purpose was and how to use them. I have so much more knowledge about my own hearing and these hearing aids. I love being able to hear again. Life will be so much better."
182,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Better Hearing with Minimum Effort,"Since receiving the Jabra Enhance Select 500 Gold Hearing Aids, my hearing has seen a remarkable improvement, giving me hope for a better auditory experience.
 
Setup and Configuration
The box is nicely packed, has a magnetic lid flap, and is sturdy enough to be reused for storage. The guides, charging case, hearing aids, power adapter, and accessories are clearly marked. I started with the ""Scan this first!"" card, which prompted me to create my Jabra Enhance account, download the Jabra Enhance Select app, and configure the hearing aids. Per the instructions, I measured my ear with the included tool, changed to a larger dome on the ear insert, and inserted the aids.
 
Jabra Enhance Select App
The App makes it easy to configure the hearing aids and select the type of environment. I use streaming mode to listen to music and make phone calls when I'm working. When I'm driving, I use the All-Around mode. When I attend meetings in crowded rooms, I use the restaurant mode. There's also an Outdoor mode. Each mode has settings for noise filter, speech clarity, volume control, and Customization for EQ settings. The top left of the screen shows the power setting of the hearing aid, and the top right shows the battery strength.
 
The Care Team
Jabra has an online Care Team with hearing doctors to help set up and configure the hearing aids. I scheduled a meeting with a doctor who took me through a hearing test, reviewed the accessories and configuration, and gave me a good tip about keeping a silicon pack in the power case to keep the hearing aids dry. The standard settings on the App are sufficient for my needs. Still, the doctor said I could send them hearing test results from visiting my local hearing doctor. They would create a custom hearing profile for my hearing aids.
 
Regular Use
It took me a few days to get used to the hearing aids, but now I can wear them without any discomfort. The domes fit easily into my ears, and the body drapes over the back of my ears. Hardly anyone notices that I'm wearing them.
 
Overall, I am very impressed with the ease of use and the level of support from Jabra, and my improved hearing is a big win for me. I highly recommend these for anyone who wants a nice pair of Over-the-Counter hearing aids without all the hassle of visiting a hearing doctor. Although I still recommend consulting a doctor, the ability to just buy the hearing aids and configure them without a doctor is amazing. Thank you, Jabra, for improving my hearing."
182,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Great customer service....,"Jambra has always done good with audio products...

This product is for my mother in law who has gradually lost her hearing over the past few years.  It has gotten progressively worse over the past year or 2 and now she is needing to use hearing aids more often than not.

When we check on her in her room she blasts her TV and when we converse with her we have to speak up and or speak toward the ear that is better which is frustrating for both us and her.

Let's get back to the product.  

Setup was a snap.  Carefully follow the step by step process after downloading the app and you are in.  I scheduled the consultation with a hearing specialist and in the meantime I walked my mother in law through the hearing test to get ready for our consultation.

The day of the consultation the person that helped us was very nice.  Oh by the way I stood in and did all the setup for my mother in law and was next to her during the setup and consultation due to her not being very tech savvy.  The consultation resulted in there Jambra employee saying that my mother in law was suffering extreme hearing loss in 1 ear over the other.  Which did not surprise me.  He also said that this hearing aide may not be suitable for her.  Which is a very honest advice.  He did not over sell their product which I appreciated and thanked him.

After we disconnected I continued to try to customize the hearing aids for my mother in law and to our surprise she actually said that her bad ear was actually able to hear better with this product.

We have tested several other OTC hearing aids and the results were hit and miss.  Other OTC would amplify the sound but also just cause for feedback and have a high pitch noise because of the reverb.

The app was easy for me to navigate.  It might not be for older folks.  So if you are a caretaker like my wife and I are you will need to set it up for the person you are caring for.

Overall I think even though my mother in law's hearing loss was considered extreme in one of her ears the fact that she was able to get a response after me tweaking the settings was a to a great plus.  Also the fact that the customer service person was honest and helpful was a double plus.

With that I would recommend this product for what we got out of it and the overall experience my mother in law and I had from Jambra."
182,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,"Excellent hearing aids, a couple of reservations","This is an excellent pair of OTC hearing aids from a well-known and reputable manufacturer.  But there were a couple of (hopefully) minor issues that knocked off a star.

The design and build are quite good.  The hearing aids themselves are lightweight, and are very innocuous when in place.  The wire that connects the earbud to the main housing that goes behind the ear is really slender, but the whole unit seems well-built and durable.  There are 3 different kinds of earbuds available -- open dome, closed dome, and tulip -- with the first two kinds coming in S, M, and L sizes.  Each of these styles has their advantages, and the professional Audiologist that works with you can help determine which is the best to use.  My wife (who is the primary user of the hearing aids) has always found earbuds difficult to use due to having narrow ear canals, but the size S buds for these hearing aids work perfectly for her.

The charging case is fairly bulky, so it’s not ideal to carry around in a handbag, but at least it’s not particularly heavy.  The lid opens smoothly, and the hearing aids are magnetically held in place in their slots.

Setup was a little wonky on the Pixel 7.  Initially, I kept getting an Error 110, even after forgetting the hearing aids, and then going through the pairing and setup process again through the Jabra Enhance Select app.  I had to reach out to Jabra support (who responded pretty quickly), and they recommended hard resetting the hearing aids, and uninstalling/reinstalling the app, which led to successful pairing.

Onboarding was impressive, since the hearing aids come with 3 years of support from a professional Audiology team.  First, there was a helpful hearing self-test on the Jabra website that determined that my wife’s hearing loss was primarily in one ear only.  Then we set up an introductory Zoom call with the Audiologist, who explained a lot of the basics on how and when to use the hearing aids, and the features available in the app.  She took the data from the hearing test and was able to remotely program the hearing aids to better match my wife’s needs.  She has since had a followup Zoom visit to check on how things are doing.  My wife noted that this Audiologist was considerably more thorough, explained things more clearly, and had a better bedside manner than the one she had seen at our primary clinic!

The hearing aids work best when used with the Jabra Enhance Select app on the phone.  In addition to allowing the Audiologist to remotely adjust the programming for the aids, it can also let the user manually adjust volume and change modes (between Noise Filter, which tries to reduce ambient sound, and Speech Clarity -- my wife found the latter to be disconcerting, because it made people sound a little robotic).  There’s also a 3-band equalizer that can be used to create a custom filter.

Overall, my wife has found the hearing aids to work very well, especially in situations with a lot of ambient noise (like at a restaurant), or when driving in a car and talking with our daughter in the backseat.  

A nice feature is the ability for the hearing aids to act as earbuds while making a call.  Both sound and mic quality are good.  However, we discovered that although this works fine for conventional cell calls, it’s buggy with Google Voice calls.  If someone calls her Google Voice number, the phone doesn’t ring at all, and doesn’t even show a notification that a call is coming in.  If she initiates a call with her Google Voice number, the call goes through and the hearing aids work fine.  But it’s a potential liability if she’s wearing the hearing aids and an important business call comes in to her Google Voice number, because she won’t be aware of it unless the caller leaves a voicemail.  I submitted this as a bug report.

Connectivity is generally good, although at one point, my wife took the hearing aids out of the case, put them in her ears, and found that they weren’t automatically reconnecting to the phone.  This cleared up after rebooting the phone.  Hopefully it doesn’t become a recurring issue.

Battery life for the hearing aids is up to 8 hrs per full charge -- we haven’t done formal testing, but this seems about right.  But we’ve found that the battery in the charging case may be an issue.  The manual says that a full charge for the case should be enough to charge the hearing aids 3 times, and if the case is on standby, it should last 12 months.  We’ve found at least a couple of times that the case discharged completely only in the course of 1-2 days, and this was with minimal use of the hearing aids.  I wonder if this might be due to the hearing aids not being seated completely securely in the slots, so perhaps they were inappropriately connecting with the phone while still in the case, thus draining the battery of the hearing aids, and then intermittently charging again.  I’ll have to keep testing this.

In summary, this is a really good choice if you’re looking for OTC hearing aids.  They function well, have a good design, and provide great support (both Audiology support and technical support).  I would’ve given it 5 stars if it weren’t for the connectivity and battery concerns that I mentioned above."

182,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Very Good (OTC) Hearing Aids,"Jabra Enhance Select 500 - Sparkling Silver

Over a number of years, I have tried various types of hearing aids from prescribed through an audiologist costing thousands and over the counter (OTC) aids that are available even without a hearing test.

The Jabra Enhance Select 500 falls into the (OTC) category. These aids are the best of the (OTC) aids that I have tried, and they are more expensive I've tried, as well.

The aids come with a great case that charges the aids and is even battery powered, as well. The advantage I see is the aids will still charge in a power outage and on a trip, you may not want or be unable to use the cable. The case has lights to show the power status of the case and the aids.

The aids themselves are very comfortable in the ear and the body of the hearing that fits behind the ear. I prefer the hearing aid inside the ear, especially because I wear glasses.
If the cable was 1/4 - 1/2 longer it might be a better fit for me. 

I will this and it is the most important aspect of a hearing aid:
   THE HEARING AIDS ARE THE BEST (OTC) AIDS I HAVE TRIED TO OVERCOME MY HEARING LOSS.

The phone app has some nice features to program the hearing aids such as tone, volume and environment. The hearing aids become the default audio when using the phone. It also works for listening to music on your phone but the sound isn't the greatest.

Overall, I gave the hearing aids a rating of 4 stars primarily due to how much improved my hearing is when I use them and also for comfort. I subtracted 1 star due to the hearing aid fitting behind the ear instead of in the ear (personal preference), the cable that goes inside the hearing aid is a bit too short and they are a bit pricey.
Once again, the important aspect is that they do help you hear better.
I would have no problem recommending them to a friend."
182,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Better bluetooth and sound quality,These replaced my 200 series and im very happy with the incredible sound quality and better bluetooth connection.
182,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"comfortable, versatile, includes free consultation","These are very nice hearing aids.  Comfortable, lightweight, easy to attach to your ear, easy to control with the app, and plenty of maintenance supplies included in the box.

Speaking of the box, the hearing aids come with an elegant storage case that also functions as the charger for the hearing aid batteries, a large variety of “domes” to attach to the aids depending on the size and shape of your ear canal, a good supply of replacement ear wax filters, a tool for measuring your ear size should a different receiver wire length be needed, and detailed instructions.  As might be expected, the instructions say to fully charge the aids before first use.  Also, the instructions say to download and install the Jabra app before using the aids. One good reason to do this is that the app gives the state of charge of each aid, so you’ll know when they are fully charged.  There is also a series of lights on the charger case to indicate the state of charge, but I found the indicator on the app more convenient.

To use the aids, install the appropriate dome for your ear (you might want to try several different sizes to see which is most comfortable), put the aids in your ears, and turn them on by pressing the button on each one for five seconds.  The control buttons are like many control buttons nowadays and can perform different functions depending on how long the the button is held down.  In the case of these aids, a brief tap of the button changes the “hearing mode” of the aid, of which there are four (all-around, restaurant, music, and outdoor).  The mode can also be changed quickly using the app.  You choose the mode depending on the ambient noise environment around you, with “all around” likely to be the setting used most often.  A set number of beeps indicates which mode is in effect as you change (one, two, three, or four, respectively).

The app also allows you to set simultaneously or independently the relative volume level of the aids, with “50%” being the default setting.  You can also set various filters to reduce noise, increase speech clarity, or customize your own.  I have left mine in the standard setting.

The aids come with two different types of dome, which is something I’ve not seen before.  The standard type is “closed,” where the dome looks like an upside-down cereal bowl.  There is also an “open” type, with openings cut into the dome, like a cereal bowl with rectangular cutouts in it here and there. The idea is that these domes can reduce or eliminate “buzzing,” if that’s something that should happen while using the aids. I’ve not experienced this, so I can’t comment on how well this works.

The box includes a supply of wax filters and tools to replace them.  You will need to, of course, order more over time.  Jabra is good at sending you emails with videos on how to do various things that I have found quite helpful.

Another aspect of the Jabra experience is that you are entitled to a free consultation via remote video call with an audiologist to discuss anything you want about the hearing aids, help you if you’re having problems, offer tips on use and care, and that sort of thing.  The instructions and app ask you to schedule a meeting practically as soon as you open the box.  I did this, but I was not able to get an appointment any sooner than two weeks later.  Then, about a week before the appointment, Jabra cancelled it and asked me to reschedule.  I did that, and the next available time was another week later. So it was a full three weeks after acquiring the aids that I was finally able to have the meeting.

This doesn’t affect your ability to use the aids as it is easy to assemble and install them in your ears and get them up and running right away.  It’s actually good to have had a chance to use them for a while before having the conversation because you’ll have had time to see how they work and better define any questions you might have.

My video call went very well. It took about 15 minutes. The audiologist answered my questions.  She also had me install the ear-measuring tool on my head and the take a photo of it, do this for each ear, and then email her the photos.  She wanted to make sure I had the correct size wire that attaches to the aid and that has to reach down into my ear canal.  The box includes only one “average” size wire, and it’s possible that you might need a longer or shorter one in your situation.  In my case, I needed a longer wire, and Jabra sent it to me by second-day air at no charge, so I had it two days. They also sent an email with a link to a video on how to change the wires, and the aids fit much better now.  Before, the ends inserted into my ears tended to pop out on their own.

One other thing that Jabra does for you is have you take a hearing test (at home) prior to using the aids.  You’ll need a pair of headphones that can connect to your phone.  The test plays a series of tones at different frequencies and different volume levels, and you indicate by tapping a button on the phone at what volume level you can first hear each tone.  This is done for each ear, and the data collected by the app is sent to the aids before you put them on for the first time. It turns out that I suffer from some loss of hearing at the higher frequencies, which I knew, but my left ear is a little worse than my right, so the aids were adjusted accordingly.

So I have been using these aids for the better part of a month now, and they’re quite nice.  Comfortable.  Easy to install.  Easy to charge up.  Nicely adjustable.  You can also schedule additional video calls if you wish, and that’s a nice feature as well.  Very highly recommended."
182,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Volume and Clarity are Exceptional,"After an hour I forgot these were in my ears!  They are the smallest, lightest weight hearing aids I have used and I have tried at least four other brands.  Basically, they are a device that connects to my phone.  I can play music and/or calls from the Jabra hearing aids or I can use the phone speaker.  I prefer the latter with the Jabra hearing aids in my ears.  I can hear the conversation or music much clearer and at a lower volume then I would without the hearing aids.  If I switch the device the phone is using to the hearing aids I can walk around the house without the phone in hand which is nice.  With some of the other hearing aids I’ve tried I would get reverberation of my own voice.  With the Jabra hearing aids I don’t have any reverberation of any kind.  They are quite sensitive and do pick up even the smallest of sounds, like taking off my glasses.  Now I hear the clack of the keys when typing or the click of the mouse.  I even hear the turn signal in the car now.  Hadn’t heard these noises in sometime!   The app is easy to use and is very straight forward.  Three delivered profile settings allow you to choose help with loudness and clarity, mostly loudness or mostly clarity.  You can adjust for focused or all around hearing based on your surroundings such as a restaurant, outdoors, etc.  Overall a very easy app to use.  The help section is easy to find and provides multiple avenues to contact support.   The app also lets you know the status of the charge so you can charge them when needed.
Because I had another set of hearing aids paired with my phone it took me awhile to figure out I needed to forget that device in order to pair the Jabra hearing aids.  Very important, look at the directions provided and pair via Bluetooth under accessibility area then install and sync with the app.  
Jabra has an excellent support system in place.  There are plenty of videos/instructions as well as a real person you can speak with by appointment.  Advance warning, appointments are a week or more out so go ahead and make your appointment right away.  My Jabra hearing aids worked great right out of the box and I didn’t think I needed to talk to anyone but I’m sure glad I did.  I learned all kinds of things I would never have figured out/known, for instance:
•	Tap your ear twice (yes your ear) and it answers the phone
•	If you press the button on the hearing aid once on the right side it raises the volume
•	If you press the button on the hearing aid once on the left side it lowers the volume
•	Press either side twice and it will rotate through the various programs (music, restaurant, outside, etc.)
•	Hold either side for 5-7 seconds and it turns the hearing aid off
•	A full charge will go up to 26 hours depending if you are streaming etc.
•	A fully charged case will charge the hearing aids three times (yep, that’s what the three little lights on the case mean.  If the case has two charges left, two lights will be lit.
•	The representative went through how to clean and how often to clean the hearing aids
•	She also explained replacing the wax guard and sent a follow up email with a link to the video about how to replace the wax guard
•	She confirmed the length of the wire was a good fit for me and I didn’t need a bit longer one as I originally thought
At the end of the call I told her, I really didn’t want to have the call but I’m so glad I did.  I learned so much and have a better understanding of how to use and care for the hearing aids.  The remote support for these Jabra hearing aids really make them the hearing aid to get.  I highly recommend them."
182,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Truly Enhanced Hearing Aid,"My sister-in-law has been using the Jabra Enhance Select 500 hearing aid for over a week, and it has significantly impacted her daily life. Thanks to its excellent design, this hearing aid fits perfectly in her ear, and the sound quality is exceptional. Here are some standout features that make this hearing aid a remarkable choice.

Perfect Fit and Comfort

The Enhance Select 500 is designed with a ""micro RIE (receiver-in-ear)"" form factor. Its ergonomic shape makes it incredibly comfortable to wear, and its tiny size makes it virtually unnoticeable. The low center of gravity prevents unwanted movement, even when my sister-in-law is on the go. She often forgets she is wearing them because they’re so discreet and comfortable.

Exceptional Sound Quality

One of the most impressive features of the Jabra Enhance Select 500 is the SoundScape speech clarity technology. Whether she is in a loud restaurant or a busy office, this technology prioritizes speech and reduces background noise. My sister-in-law can enjoy rich sound in even the most complex listening situations, making conversing with multiple people around her easier.

Advanced Connectivity

These hearing aids are among the first in the industry to offer Bluetooth LE Audio and Auracast. They also support connectivity features like hands-free calls, ensuring compatibility with current and future devices. This makes the Jabra Enhance Select 500 a future-proof choice for anyone looking for advanced connectivity options.

Hands-Free Phone Calls with TapControl

With TapControl, my sister-in-law can take phone calls just like she would with earbuds. By double-tapping her ear or hearing aid, she can answer calls without searching for her phone or the program button. This feature is incredibly convenient and makes staying connected effortless.

Customization and Support

The Jabra Enhance Select 500 allows for customizable settings. My sister-in-law could customize the settings, giving her complete control over her hearing experience.

Virtual Care & Support Included

What truly sets the Jabra Enhance Select 500 apart is the virtual care and support included. If needed, she will have access to professional virtual hearing care from the Audiology Team for three years. This includes step-by-step programming of her hearing aids and unlimited ongoing adjustments and fine-tuning based on her hearing needs. This level of support ensures she always has the best possible hearing experience.

Long-Lasting Battery and Convenient Charging Case

The portable Charging Case is another fantastic feature. It holds three total charges before needing to be plugged in again, and a single three-hour charge can power the hearing aids for over 24 hours of listening. My sister-in-law can enjoy solid and clear hearing wherever life takes her without worrying about battery life.

Conclusion

The Jabra Enhance Select 500 hearing aid has been a game-changer for my sister-in-law. Its perfect fit, exceptional sound quality, advanced connectivity, customization options, and long-lasting battery life make it an outstanding choice. I highly recommend the Jabra Enhance Select 500 to anyone looking for a top-of-the-line hearing aid that delivers on all fronts."
182,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,"Fantastic hearing aids, I would highly recommend","Over the counter (OTC) hearing aids cover a wide range of capabilities and prices. In some cases, you get what you pay for; in others, not so much. While the Jabra Enhance Select 500 hearing aids are more expensive than many others, in this case you really are getting what you pay for. They are, in a word, outstanding.

The first thing you are likely to notice is that the Enhance Select 500 are quite small for rechargeable hearing aids. While larger than my smallest (battery powered) hearing aids, they are small enough to be mostly hidden (if you’re fortunate enough to have the hair to cover them), and light enough to wear comfortably all day. Even with glasses, they fit easily over the ear.

Physical setup is easy enough. You use a sizing tool to select the hearing wire and you choose the dome size that fits your ears best, and you’re ready to go. Electronic adjustment is a bit more involved. To get the most out them, you’ll want to take Jabra’s on-line hearing test or, ideally, submit a professional audiogram.

Hearing loss is different for everyone. The amount of loss at each frequency varies. Simple settings, such as bass, treble, and volume, aren’t able to reflect accurately many people’s hearing loss pattern, it takes more nuanced adjustments to really help. This is why the better OTC hearing aids (and all professional hearing aids) are adjusted after a hearing test. Some OTC hearing aids use a test in the app, some use an on-line test. The Enhance Select use an on-line test or a current audiogram from your audiologist. An audiologist at Jabra will them meet with you via video conference and customize your hearing aids remotely. While it took nearly a week to schedule an appointment, it was well worth it. Once we got them properly set up, they worked extremely well. Jabra offers free on-line consultations and adjustments for three years, which matches the life expectancy of a professional hearing aid. (Although I have had some for far longer than this, and they still work just fine.) 

The sound quality of the Enhance Select 500 is fantastic. I’ve used the music setting to listen to music around the house and to attend a concert and was very happy with the results. Otherwise, I leave it on the all-around setting. Speech recognition is my main problem, and the speech fine tuning in the all-around setting makes a significant difference. Even in very noisy restaurants, I found this setting quite clear, and more useful than the restaurant setting.

The Enhance Select 500 will also stream audio from your phone. You can use the hearing aids to take calls, listen to GPS navigation, or whatever other Bluetooth audio input you have. The connection works very well, and it’s convenient not to have to switch to earbuds or find the “sweet spot” to place your phone speaker by the hearing aid’s microphone.

I have different hearing aids that I use for different purposes, and I find myself reaching for these a lot. The sound quality, comfort, and convenience makes for a great combination."
182,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Excellent Jabra Enhance Select OTC Hearing Aids,"As a person who's hearing is severeely impaired, I looked forward to receiving Jabra Enhance Select 500 OTC Hearing Aids for testing and writing of this review. I ordered the hearing aids in Sparkling Silver color and was quite pleased with that choice as they matched my graying hair. They look great behind my ears and the in-ear cables are very hard to see.

With their rechargeable premium charger that connects to a power source using a USB-C cable and plug, the Jabra hearing aids in under 3.5 hours for a first time charge. Additional 30 minute charges provide up to 8 hours of battery life and a 3 hour charge gives you up to 30 hours of use! 

Jabra Enhance Select 500 hearing aids come with :
     1) Fitting Tools including an ear measuring tool, a wide range of earbud dome selection to fit most any ear, and sport locks to use when working out or performing strenuous activities.
     2) Cleaning Tools including a cleaning cloth , brush and wax guard kit.
     3) Power Tools including a premium rechargeable case, wall charger and USB-C cable.
Overall this is a well thought out, designed and quality built hearing aid package.

Jabra GN provides users with a hearing test to help determine your hearing profile and to aid in setting up their premium hearing devices. Licensed audiologists are available to assist in setting up and using the Jabra hearing aids. The hearing test was available to me online and was very easy to perform. Set up using Jabra Enhance software application (free download for your IOS or Andorid smartphone devices) was simple and had me up and running in a very short period of time once I'd charged the hearing aids for the first time.

With a one year basic warranty (three year coverage is available at an optional expense) coverage includes repairs, loss and damage from Jabra.

After two full weeks of using these new Jabra Enhance Select 500 OTC Hearing Aids, I have found them to be quite comfortable to wear using the standard domes the units were shipped with and quite acceptable in all situations. I can hear well in restaurants, outdoors, working out in gym and happy to stream music through them from my music library and other sources such as Amazon, Apple and Spotify. While the music quality isn't outstanding just having streaming available allows me to use these great new Jabra hearing aids everyday everywhere!"

Jabra Enhance Select 500 - Gold - 

Incredibly, I’ve tried half a dozen pairs of Over-the-Counter (OTC) hearing aids over the last few years. Some were fine, some were less so, and some were outstanding. My current pair of Jabra Enhance aids are definitely in the outstanding category, but as they are almost two years old, I’ve been eager to upgrade for a few extra features now available. These Jabra Enhance Select 500 hearing aids provide three of my most sought-after features: enhanced listening, hands free calling, and music streaming. 

By including three microphones on the aids, Jabra has improved the quality of the audio, created better directionality of sounds around you, and best of all, improved the noise cancelling abilities of these hearing aids. 

I like the built-in features available with a click of the buttons on these aids, but the Jabra app makes even more features easily available. 

If you’re choosing between the Premium and Basic options, I think the extra cost of the Premium option is well worth it! You get three years of warranty and loss and damage protection (instead of one year), but most importantly, you get three years of professional help from trained audiologists. Having already owned a pair of Jabra aids with this service, I can’t overstate how great this is. The professional staff are bright, professional, and highly knowledgeable. Over Zoom, they were able to use my recent audiometry data from my audiologist to customize my hearing aids specifically to my needs. They remotely uploaded these new settings into my hearing aids so that they use these specifications. 

I’m very excited about the Bluetooth LE Audio and Auracast features! Bluetooth LE (for Low Energy) means my hearing aid charge will last longer, even if I’m using them for phone calls or music. Although Auracast tech doesn’t (yet) work with my iPhone, I’m looking forward to having aids that will be able to use this emerging tech. It’s nice to know that these hearing aids are designed for today and tomorrow."
182,BestBuy,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Is your Wife Starting to Mumble like Mine Did?,"When my friends and I got together for a game of cards in the past few years, I began to notice that the topic of Wife Mumbling (instead of speaking clearly like she used to), began to come up more and more frequently.  Turns out, IT WAS US!  Now days, (when we’re desperate for a new topic), conversations about hearing aids and hearing test results have started. Because we live in a rural area rather far from services that most people take for granted, the issue of how long and time consuming a drive to an audiologist is. Because I was (for the first time in my life), curious about hearing aids, the sight of a Jabra Hearing-Aid being included in the Best Buy website caught my eye.  Because the whole issue of hearing loss starts with hearing tests, I envisioned the old days of sitting in a sound proof booth with an audiologist fiddling with buttons and dials as I lifted my finger when I could hear the various frequency and loudness tones.  I was very skeptical of the idea of ordering hearing aids for delivery and then getting a genuine hearing test and professional consultation online.
It works though. Here’s how they do it. First, they ship the hearing aids to you with a generic frequency setup that allows you to get used to the fit and feel. You’ll then establish an online account, so you can communicate with them.  They had several good videos that you’ll be able to access to answer general questions and get ready for the hearing test. While you’re online in your account, you’ll see a button that says “Take Hearing Test” when you're ready. You don’t need any human contact to do this. It’s available to you 24/7. With a good set of earphones (normally used to listen to online music), I simply pressed the “Take Hearing Test” button. Then at my own pace, I was prompted to press a tone/frequency button and press Yes if I could hear a tone, and No if I couldn’t. At first, I couldn’t hear anything, but then as the frequency was lowered each time, I was eventually able to press Yes.  It went very smoothly. After a couple of days, I received an email telling me my test had been evaluated. A Zoom call with the audiologist was scheduled. Before that meeting, they changed the frequency settings on my hearing aids with an over-the-air update.  One morning I noticed immediately that it had changed, as everything sounded crisper. My App screen changed too, so I could switch back between the new settings and the original, as many times as I wanted.  Another call was scheduled with my assigned audiologist, who I had Zoom called earlier.  We discussed what their findings were, what they did, and what my feelings good or bad were about the changes.  They did not rush me and thoroughly answered all my questions and offered suggestions that didn’t occur to me at first. For example, they original package had included a measuring device which you hold to your ear while you have the hearing-aid installed. You then position yourself so the audiologist can see it using your phone or laptop’s camera. After viewing the fit, the audiologist recommended and sent at no charge, two microphone sections with longer wires, so that the microphone went into my ear deeper and much more securely. They included these at no charge. They also encouraged contacting them anytime during their working hours. They will help you get the best fit and results.
I’ve read other reviews by people complaining about the tininess of the sound produced. You need to remember that these are not music listening devices. What these do is amplify the specific frequencies your ears no longer hear well.  Suddenly you’ll notice all of the high frequencies you haven’t heard for years. You’ll hear noises like people jiggling keys, stacking chips at the card table, the sound of air conditioners, sirens, screaming jet engines and yes, relatively unpleasant high-pitched voices compared to how they sounded when everything was low frequency and slightly muffled.  The audiologist will warn you that you have to get used to it and give the hearing-aids a chance to do their intended job. Wearing hearing aids is not like hearing beautiful music through high end earbuds or earphones. It is going to make you hear sounds you haven’t heard in years and it will sound relatively high pitched.  Because I’m not completely acclimatized to my Jabras, I must admit that at the end of the day, if nobody else is around that I have to understand and listen to, I will remove them and put them back on their charger, so I am once again surrounded by that lower frequency muffled sound that is much less jarring. The real world is sometimes unpleasantly noisy. However, the good news is that suddenly my wife has stopped mumbling so much! I guess that’s makes it all worth it

182,BestBuy,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Jabra Enhance Select 500,"This is my second set of Jabra OTC hearing aids. While I have grown accustomed to the feeling of my hearing aids, this set is a vast improvement. Every set comes with remote customer assistance to fine tune the hearing aids. After this customization the sound and tone quality will be set to your precise specifications.
Using the hearing aids out of the box requires the Jabra application. After initial setup you schedule an appointment to get remote customer assistance. While this step may take some time it is worth the investment of time to fully customize each hearing aid. When the hearing aids are connected to your phone via Bluetooth you can also make and receive calls via the hearing aid through touch.
