95,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Good, but...","These were almost exactly what I wanted. I have another pair of devices I use daily. But I take long walks (3-10 miles) and stream music. Then I stream TV at night, keeping the sound blocked on the TV so it isn't too loud for others. That runs the battery down a lot, and often cuts the TV time short. Plus when I walk I sometimes encounter strangers who want to talk to me (a friendly town), so I needed something while walking that didn't completely block external sounds like earbuds do.I was able to set these up and get them sounding almost as good as the devices I already had which cost much more. Just wearing them around the house gave good results: I could hear and understand people well, the batteries seemed more than sufficient that they alone could handle most or all of my longest walks.Then I found a problem. No matter what I did, I could only get streaming and phone in one ear. It was always whichever ear paired last. I tried several things and the result was always the same. I can't use the phone with only one ear using something plugged in, though I can hold the phone up to my ear and use just one ear. Music isn't pleasant at all in only mono. I could handle it in mono in both ears, but in only one ear it's disturbing. So I contacted the vendor. I was told all of their devices are mono and that was normal behavior.I've already started a return. If they ever fixed that so it went to both ears, even if it combined both channels of audio into one, I might be willing to give them another try. But those went back and it'll probably be too late for me to try again if that ever changes."
95,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,poor product,A hissing sound was present at all volume levels. Using the app didn't fix the problem.

159,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Very Poor Sound Quality,"Dislikes in order of importance:1  Terrible sound quality - no matter what mode or volume sound came through like I was in an echo chamber.2.  I could hear more sounds - aka volume - but quality was such that I still could not understand a lot of what people were saying.  aka the aids were not an aid.3.  Trying to adjust via a tiny button in my ear was awkward at best.  Having an app which would be much better.4.  No way of knowing what setting the aid was at, except for cycling all the way through all the settings on each ear - frustrating at best.Likes (note that these likes are useless if the aid does no good):1. Small size2. Case and charging3. Price - although the insurance cost is ridiculous"
159,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,No customer support or comments from manufacturer,"I was looking at the devices shown here and while it sounds like some users tweaked the hearing aid enough to get it to wor, no response from customer service is really surprising. The manufacturer does not care about their product if they are not responding g to complaints. Based on that alone I would not buy them! In fact I challenge the manufacturer. If they are so good reach out to me with a pair and I will be happy to review your product."
159,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Wast of money,All I can say is Garbage. Not worth it at any price.

159,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Save your money,They screech and howl no matter what you do. Which is a shame because they really are ALMOST undetectable and comfortable.
159,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,If you are having problems with squealing feedback... Read This! There is a solution.,"Overall these have worked very well. Despite what you may have read in other reviews, there is a simple solution that the enclosed booklet does not address very well. If you are getting squealing feedback you are probably using the wrong domes. The Neo XS comes with three size  of domes. They come fitted for the medium size which is what I first used. While they felt comfortable, as soon as I started increasing the volume I would get an annoying squeal. I was almost ready to give up on them when I decided to use a lager size dome included in the box mostly fixed the problem. A small adjustment I figured out was that if you push it in a bit more than comfortable and then pull it slightly out just a bit, it makes a better seal and stops the feedback from the outer microphone to the inner speaker that causes the problem. As I wore them over time, I now use them on volume level seven without any annoying feedbackYou can buy replacement domes from MD Hearing, however they are over priced compared to other domes. Unfortunately they are quite specialized and I have not been able to find them on Amazon or from any other source. The same is true with the wax guards which seem somewhat overpriced.Customer service at MD Hearing is a mixed bag. When you reach someone, they can be quite helpful. My right hearing aid developed an annoying static hum. The company quickly sent a replacement which worked fine. While I did get good service, their call tree for customer assistance is slow and tedious. It takes a long time to get through as they seem understaffed.I chose not to buy the MDShield Protection Plan. It would cover most problem you might encounter with a ""free"" repair or replacement. They advertise it for $12 on sale, however what they don't tell you unless you wade through the aforementioned irritating phone tree to customer service is that the payment is $12 per month. At that price, you would more than pay for a replacement in less than a year. You are better off saving your money and just buy a replacement from Amazon. As prices of these OTC hearing aids keeps dropping, you'd probably save money.Having said all that, the Neo XS is a good reliable hearing aid, but customer service need some work. Because of the price and quality, I gave the product 5 stars despite customer service and price of accessories."
159,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,One hearing aid bad,"The right hearing aid just suddenly stopped working after three weeks. I’m trying to get a refund and replacement. I’ve been waiting and waiting for five over five days and the seller is not even responding. I’ll get back to you and let you know if I ever got a replacement, it says that it’s replaceable before 45 days after that they don’t replace it"
159,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Loud feedback,"Loud feedback, could not be corrected even after calling support.  No improvement with audio."
159,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good Value,"These hearing aids did not fit into the ear canal as expected, though they are advertised as CIC."
159,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fit well with adjustable volume push button on the back.,I really like the comfortable fit. They don't hurt my ears.  The adjustable volume by push  button on the back makes it very easy & fast to adjust the volume as needed. Best hearing aids I've ever owned.
159,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Mine quit working inside of 4 months, they advertize a 1 year warrenty but refuse to honor it","Mine quit working inside of 4 months, they advertize a 1 year warrenty but refuse to honor it and want between 70 and a 100 dollars to repair them. Only the right side quit. They say that if you buy them from Amazon it seems there is no warrentyJUNK JUNK JUNK"
159,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Whistling,"When turning the volume to the max, there is whistling. For average use it is ok."
159,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Low quality and defected right ear piece,"The media could not be loaded.
                



The quality of this hearing aid is as low as the same functional item you can buy with $80. In addition to that I received the right piece is not working completely."
159,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Terrible,Terrible hearing aids.
161,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Relatively light and small,"I have minor hearing loss in one ear and these hearing aids are a little too strong for me right now.  However, the sound they produce is clear and understandable with no feedback or hiss at the lowest volume.  I’m also not used to behind-the-ear units as my regular hearing aid is an in-canal model.  For this style of hearing aid, it’s light and comfortable on its own.  I tend to use my hearing aid most often with headphones so I have more balanced sound right/left and the unit behind the ear starts to cause discomfort after about an hour or so.There aren’t a lot of controls here; you get the volume levels and programs but there is no app or other options for customization.  So this is best for hearing loss that’s relatively similar across the frequency spectrum, or at least across the vocal range.  Nevertheless, I think there is enough here for the price that for anyone experiencing hearing loss, this could be a first step toward a prescription hearing aid, which generally costs much more than this one.  The color also blends in with lighter skin tones and is perhaps less obvious than a big black or white unit hanging off one’s ear.The charging case is somewhat bulky - much more so than your average Bluetooth earbuds case - but for this style of hearing aid for the charge it holds, it’s acceptable.  It can fit in a medium-sized purse but because you can turn off each hearing aid, you can also carry them in something smaller, maybe even in a pocket.  I do like that flexibility.Worth a try if you’re shopping around in this price range."
161,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,good quality OTC hearing aid,"This is a review of the Mercury version of the Linner hearing aids.This in-canal hearing aid comes with extra earpieces (couple of different sizes), a USB cable, a cleaning brush, and a case. I like that the case acts as a charger and stores enough energy by itself to work even when not connected to a USB charging source. The aid itself has three modes and 8 sound levels.My hearing issues are mild and thus my take on this aid may not be the same as those with greater hearing loss. First, I have one ear that (because of previous non-hearing-related ) surgery is shaped a little differently and I was unable to keep the aid in that ear canal. The other ear was no problem, the aid fit normally and seated well. I tried the aid on all three modes and, frankly, could not detect any major difference between them. The volume levels can go from low to quite loud so it is likely that you will find something that works. Using the behind-the-ear controls is a bit difficult until you get used to it. The noise reduction works nicely and is a good feature to have on an OTC aid at this price point. My only issue is that the sound is a bit ""tinny"" but, again, this is not a $3,000+ prescription aid.One of the things I like that others may not is that this is ""just"" a hearing aid. There is no bluetooth and you are not using it as ear buds for music, TV or the like. Linner's Nova model has that feature, if you want it. This one, at this price point, seems like a good OTC option, particularly if you just want to try one out to see if it will work for you."
161,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,OK amplifier,The model we received is not the one in the current product listing.Works OK and has multiple modes including use as normal earbuds for music etc. Has noise cancelling capability and assist for hearing as well.
161,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,It works OK and seems to be a quality product.,"The hearing aids come in blue, red, or black, and they have a sleek and modern look that is quite impressive. They are also very lightweight and nearly invisible, making them ideal for discreet and long-term wearing. The package includes two hearing aids, one for each ear, a charging case, a USB-C cable, six ear tips of different sizes, a cleaning brush, and a user manual.The hearing aid settings are changed by using just one button on each device. You can turn them on or off, adjust the volume, and switch between three modes: normal, noisy, and outdoor. The normal mode is for everyday situations, the noisy mode is for crowded environments, and the outdoor mode is for windy or open spaces. You can also mute the hearing aids by holding the button for three seconds. The hearing aids will beep to indicate the volume level and the mode you're in.One of the main features of these hearing aids is their 16-channel digital processing, which is supposed to optimize human voice enhancement and ensure you hear conversations loud and clear. I tested this feature in various scenarios, such as talking to my friends, watching TV, listening to music, and walking through the park. I have to say that I was impressed by how well these hearing aids amplified the sounds I wanted to hear and reduced the sounds I didn't. The speech was crisp and clear, and the background noise was minimal. The echo-free and noise reduction technology really worked as advertised.Another feature that I liked was the high-capacity rechargeable battery that supposedly lasts for up to 18 hours of continuous use. I got about 12 hours before a recharge was needed, so I think that claim was a bit of an exaggeration. Still, 12 hours seems good enough for daily use. The charging case is also very convenient and easy to use. It has four LED indicators that show the battery level of each hearing aid and the case itself. You can charge the case with the USB-C cable or wirelessly with any Qi-compatible charger. The case can fully charge the hearing aids in about an hour and a half, and it can provide up to four full charges before it needs to be recharged itself.The LINNER Mercury OTC Hearing Aids Rechargeable are compatible with both Android and iPhone devices, but they don't have any Bluetooth connectivity or app support. This means that you can't stream audio directly from your phone or adjust the settings through an app. This might be a deal-breaker for some people who want more customization and convenience. However, I didn't find this to be a major issue, as I was satisfied with the sound quality and performance of these hearing aids without any extra features. There are a lot of seniors who want nothing to do with phones and computers, so these OTC hearing are a good choice for them. The onboard controls were made about as simple as they could be made.Overall, I think these hearing aids are a great option for anyone who needs a simple and effective solution for their hearing loss. They offer excellent sound clarity, noise reduction, comfort, design, and battery life. They are also easy to use and maintain. The only drawbacks are the lack of Bluetooth connectivity and app support, which might limit some users' preferences and options. I deducted a star for that, because the price should have reflected the absence of these features, but it doesn't."
161,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Perfect for my needs, Comfortable to wear, nice rechargeable case.","I ordered this pair of hearing aids to wear out when I'm having difficulties hearing people. Especially a church. I find them very comfortable, lightweight, and easy to wear and they do not irritate me after long periods of wearing them. That is a great amplifier that has three different modes cancels out background noise and has eight volumes. So I can pick and choose how loud and low. I want to hear it. It does take some time to get used to the different commands to set it right to make it feel comfortable. I like that I can charge them and when I wear my glasses they do not hurt or irritate me. I do feel that this is an amazing price compared to other ones I have seen and have researched.  I also have had these for a very quite period and I've had no issues with them. This has greatly improved my confidence and my ability to communicate well with others. I'm grateful that I ordered them and would recommend them."
161,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The App Makes These Hearing Amplifiers Great, If The Batteries Wouldn't Discharge So Quickly IMO...","Let me state my typical clarification and cautionary note that I assign to all Hearing Amplifiers that I review as a Vine Reviewer for Amazon and it goes as follows:Practically all of the Hearing Amplifier sellers on Amazon list somewhere in the description that they are selling Hearing Aids and in the very basic sense of the word they do aid in someone's hearing but they are definitely not true hearing aids. To me these should be listed as Hearing Amplifiers only and whatever hearing amplifiers you decide to purchase they are not true hearing aids but what most would consider as PSAP's (personal sound amplification products). These hearing amplifiers are sufficient for helping the elderly or hearing impaired with mild to somewhere below moderate hearing loss. True hearing aids amplify only certain frequencies based on your hearing profile or normally called an Audiogram where over the years you're lacking certain sounds due to one reason or another, but PSAPs amplify all sounds equally so if you use these aids to assist you with your hearing loss just be sure to start your volume level at the lowest level possible that offers a benefit to your hearing because if you crank them up too loud it may sound good at first but you may, over time, lose what good hearing you have left...Now to comment on my likes and dislikes for these Linner Hearing Amplifiers.  The biggest drawback I see is the battery life, I placed them into my ears at approx. 10:00 a.m. this morning and by 4:00 p.m. both of the amplifiers had died and needed to be recharged. I know the Amazon site states by the seller that the battery life is 40 hours but I'm assuming from my experience that they are referring to the carrying case battery life and not the hearing amplifiers. Most of the other amplifier sellers with high end products like these Linner's state how long of usage time you would have between charging and it's sad that the usage time frame is not spelled out for these Linner amplifiers. Based on viewing the battery life on their App the higher the volume level being used the quicker the batteries discharge. I had my right ear at level 5 out of 8 and my left ear at volume level 4 and it lasted approx. 30 minutes longer than my right ear amplifier and that's after I let them both charge overnight in the carrying case...Now for the positive aspect of these hearing amplifiers, their App makes these hearing amplifiers special and if you don't intend on using it then shame on you. With the App you can set your volume level for each ear and there is even a bass and treble setting you could use to tweak the sound slightly. The overall Sound Quality is very good and the Bluetooth is another feature I really love since I can take calls or stream my favorite music while I'm working around my home. So if you're not concerned with the overall hours of usage between charging then I can highly recommend giving these Linner Hearing Amplifiers a try!"
161,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,These work great!,Easy to use and comfortable.  They work amazing. Sound is clear and just amazed
161,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect amplifier,"Works great for my mom that lives with us. Despite her being in denial about her hearing loss, she has slowly adapted to using these and has noted some benefit. Noise cancelling helps. Seem to be a good low cost option for those in beginning stages of hearing loss."
161,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,You can't beat these!,"If I go through insurance, you would not believe the price I would have to pay for aids that are something similar, but inferior!  What a steal of a deal. These are as good or better as the ones offered by insurance programs. You don't need to go anywhere to get an aid that will work for you. Online is just as good and these Linner aids are great!I don't get any whistling.The sound is not distorted.Easy to adjust the volume according to where I am at.These aids do a great job of amplifying the sound.I can size the earbud portion right in my own home as they give you different size plugs to get the right fit.The case auto shuts the aids off when placed in it.They give you advice on how to work your way up to wearing them full-time. This was what I needed!Goodbye Audio specialists. This is as good as getting groceries delivered to your door! Love them!They even give you 24-hour-a-day service if you need them. How awesome is that! Very kind and knowledgeable about their product. They want you to succeed.AND the charging case- puts the old aids to shame-yes!"
161,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,LINNER Mercury OTC Hearing Aids,"I wouldn't exactly call these ""hearing aids"". These are more like hearing amplifiers. They boost the sounds around you for the most part. They aren't like hearing aids in they will pull up human voice more, but instead boost EVERYTHING around you. Decent enough for some applications but all in all not that great for people that need true hearing aids."
161,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,very good quality,"These hearing aids are easy to set up , they are bluetooth and rechargeable and have a long battery life . They are noise cancelling . They are pricey but well worth the price ."
161,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome OTC choice,"These hearing aids are an excellent OTC option compared to ""prescription"" choices. They are lightweight and comfortable. I really like that they have their own charging case and do not require batteries. They are low profile with easily adjustable volume. There is no reason to pay more!"
161,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Lightweight design, adaptive features","Upon receiving the device, I was struck by its lightweight design. It felt comfortable and unobtrusive, which was important for my grandmother, who preferred discreet solutions. The white color seamlessly blended with her hair, making it virtually undetectable to others.As my grandma began using this Hearing Aid in her daily life, I noticed a significant improvement in her overall confidence and communication abilities. She expressed gratitude for the newfound clarity and comfort the device provided, allowing her to reconnect with the people around her in meaningful ways."
161,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Really good hearing aids,"I've tested these out myself along with my 90 year old grandmother who lives with us. Right out of the box, these have a very professional presentation. Everything is clean and organized. It comes with the simple to use charging case and lots of accessories (different size ear buds, etc).The sound quality is very good. They're easy to use. They're easy to put the earbuds into your ears. These also have a nice long charge for all day use. My grandmother says that she really likes that it's easy to adjust the volume. We would both highly recommend them!"
161,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Unrivaled Sound Clarity,"The adaptive noise cancellation feature of this hearing aid is really great. It effectively reduces background noise, allowing me to focus on conversations and enjoy clearer sound quality even in noisy environments.The sound quality of these hearing aids outstanding. Voices sound natural and distinct, with no distortion or muffling. I can easily distinguish between different sounds and tones, making conversations more enjoyable and engaging.Battery life is another area where they excel. With up to 20 hours of continuous use on a single charge, I never have to worry about running out of power during the day."
161,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good hearing assistance; not all features available without app,"These ear bud style hearing aids were easy to pair to Bluetooth and fit nicely. I like being able to use them to listen to music and take calls. Volume adjustment is easy using the separate up and down buttons on each aid; the default volume is level 5 of 8 (I used level 1). It picked up all sounds for me, and amplified my own voice more than is to my liking (which is common for most of the hearing aids I have tried). Noise cancellation did not include much in the way of white noise (static sound), and the only unpleasant sounds (squealing, etc.) occurred when I accidently covered the microphone on either aid. Another nice first I have encountered is the built in UV sterilizer, which automatically starts when the aids are placed in the case (it takes about a minute to complete). There are 2 nits for me, the first being I have a challenge removing the aids from the case as I have larger hands and they are smooth and held in place magnetically. Secondly and more important is I could not figure a means to change hearing modes without using the app. I installed the app to see what features were accessed through it and in addition to mode settings, there is a personalized hearing test. It would be nice to have access to all of the features of the aids without installing an app as I personally try to minimize the number of apps I use. These hearing aids come with a carrying / charging case, instructions, extra sets of pads, and a USB C cord (without an adapter)."
161,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Absolutely Sleek,These are a beautifully sleek and easy to use pair of rechargeable hearing aids. They come in a nice box with easy to use instructions. You'll be able to use them right out of the box in less than 5 mins as the instructions are very easy to follow AND the hearing aids come with a bit of charge.
161,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Need to look further,"These hearing aids are so much smaller than the over the ear hearing aids of years past!   I have small ears so for me this was an issue.  These fit well and are more discrete also. The sound quality is quite good  also. I like that there is no need for pairing. I really wanted to like them....However, and there is a ""however"".  The instructions are very vague. I have mild hearing loss. There are supposed to be different modes.  Personally I could not hear a difference between any of them.  The big negative issue was although they did a wonderful job amplifying the TV etc. every other sound was amplified also.   Just crumpling papers, keyboard clicks etc  were just too noisy for me.  Unless I sat perfectly still there was unwanted noise. Trying to adjust them wasn't successful either.  Perhaps with more time wearing them this would become less of an issue, I don't know.  Or maybe it is just me, they didn't work as I had hoped."
161,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Weightless,This is the best hearing aid I have ever used. Even after several hours of use I don’t even know I am wearing them. They are light and weightless and therefore comfortable throughout the day. They arrived with extra earplugs so you can customize the fit. I have been using this item for about a week and a half and have had no problems with earbud fall out. They are USB charged and therefore never a need for batteries. I haven’t experienced any annoying feedback or sound interference. It’s a pleasure to be able to have a conversation without saying “ what? “ a million times or asking people to repeat themselves. I have not noted any distortion of speech or environmental sounds.
161,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Comparison to Phonak,"I have a pair of Phonak BTE hearing aids that were programmed and provided by an Audiologist.  I have mild hearing loss and they are fantastic.I got these for my wife but she wanted me to evaluate them before she started using them so here goes.For me, the easiest thing is to compare these to my Phonaks.  No, that's not a fair fight but I hope to point out what the extra money buys you.Fit, BTE and RIC have basically the same form factor.  The part behind the ear is almost the same size.  The Phonaks are a bit heavier but you'll never notice it.  A notable difference is the wire that connects the cone to the part behind your ear.  The wires are the same but my Audiologist fitted a few different wire lengths to my Phonak for the proper fit.  This one comes with one wire and it sticks out a bit.  Most people won't notice the wire (it'll just look like some errant hair).These come with 2 cone sizes.  The Phonak can be fitted with 4 different sizes but one of the 2 should work for most people.  Interestingly these use the same type filter that my old Phonaks used; it sort of looks like a toothpick - use one end to take the filter out, flip it and there's a new filter on the opposite side that you push in.  I actually prefer this over Phonak's current method.Sound - I remember when I first got my hearing aids.  It was an awful experience.  Everything was so loud that I wanted to take them out and throw them in drawer and forget about them.  But, my Audiologist warned me about this and told me to hang in there because my brain needed re-training.  It took about a week while I adjusted to all the new sounds and the volume.  But eventually everything was OK and I could hear things I hadn't heard before (I remember telling my wife that the turn signal on the car actually made a clicking noise!)  I didn't get that experience with these because my brain was already re-trained so I had my wife try them on and her first comment was how loud everything was.More on sound - The Phonak has volume control on the housing.  Press the right one to increase volume, the left to lower volume.  Ditto with these but you seem to have to do them individually.  The Phonaks are programmable and they were programmed by my Audiologist for my specific hearing loss.  These are what they are.  I hear OK with these but the Phonaks are better.These don't have an app.  My old Phonaks didn't have an app  either but the ones I have  now do and I couldn't be happier.  They connect to my phone via Bluetooth so I can listen to music and make/receive phone calls; since the call is going through my hearing aid I hear the conversation perfectly.  The Phonak also has a transmitter that I've attached to my soundbar so TV audio goes directly to my hearing aide.  These don't have those types of features.The app also lets me choose different environments, for example, I can select ""restaurant"" and a lot of the background noise goes away and I can hear my dinner companions much better.  These do block out some of the background noise but not enough for me.  With the Phonak I can also make my own environments and I can customize things like bass/treble, etc.  It's a very nice feature.  These - nope.The manual that comes with these isn't very good. But, neither is the one that comes with the Phonak.  I think you have to be an Audiologist to understand it.  However, the Phonaks are a popular brand so there are videos, etc available on the web.Overall the Phonaks are much better but, and it's a big but, they cost around $1,800.  That's a lot more money.  Is it worth it?  For me, yes. But, I'm spoiled.  You can't go from a luxury automobile to Kia's cheapest model and expect the same ride and performance.My wife started wearing these after I played around with them for a few days.  The first week was fun.  Instead of saying ""huh?"" when I said something she started telling me to lower my voice.  She's adjusted now and definitely notices the difference between wearing them and not wearing them.  Although she's envious of the  added features I have she's content.  Her hearing loss isn't as severe as mine so I think that helps.These are probably worth a try within the return window.  Just remember that the first week isn't going to be all that great."
161,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,This has a lot to offer over other O-T-C hearing aids.,"The LINNER NOVA LITE BLUETOOTH RECHARGEABLE IN-EAR HEARING AIDS WITH SMART NOISE CANCELLATION AND VOLUME CONTROL is like the Cadillac of over the counter hearing aids.  Since the laws changed, now making hearing aids available over the counter, without oversight by a medical professional, there's been an explosion of innovations, choices and possibilities, for the hearing challenged.This is the third over the counter hearing aid I’ve tried.  This is far and away my favorite, from among the three.  They all take a bit of getting used to.  I suggest you start the journey to acclimate yourself with any new hearing aid, when you're alone, perhaps watching TV.  You should increase the time use it a little every day.  When you're comfortable with that, you will eventually start introducing it to different kinds of environments and settings.This not only helps you to get comfortable wearing the device and using the controls, it helps you to know which adjustments give you the best possible sound, in a given environment. By the time you are using it in a noisy environment, with lots of different, simultaneous conversations going on, you're able to easily adjust the settings and volume to what works best for your particular situation and hearing ability.  One of the hardest things to do is get used to the sound of your own voice. It always sounds particularly loud, and is something I'm still working to get used to.Some features of this particular hearing aid that make it my favorite are the following:This comes with two hearing aids, one for each ear, clearly marked L and R.These are almost entirely internal, and not readily visible to people that don't know you're wearing them.Volume adjustments on this are intuitive, and easy to reach and find without removing them from your ears.They're clear indicator lights which help you navigate the settings.There is minimal feedback.They do a good job of noise-canceling.They have a case, that makes charging and storing them as easy as it could possibly be.In conclusion, if you've been less than satisfied with over-the-counter hearing aids, this model and style could very well be the solution you’ve been looking for.  Everything about this product makes using a hearing aid a better, easier, and more fulfilling experience than what I've experienced with other hearing aids, in the past."
161,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Doesn’t work for her,Based on information on these and examining them they seem really quality hearing aids.We thought this would work really well for my mother in law.  Upon opening and reading the information we determined this was not a good choice.  Nothing wrong with the hearing aids themselves.  More we saw some things that may make them not the best choice for her.  She has dementia and trying to determine the right setting without clear instructions in knowing which setting it’s at would be difficult..  The replaceable ear domes while a great option is a worry for us.  She tends to shove her hearing aids in really deep and she also stashes them in random places.  So our concerns are the domes coming off somewhere.  Not saying they come off easy just it’s our worry.
161,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Those Looking into Hearing Aids Should Look here First,"I ordered this hearing aid for my mom, who at ninety has experienced just enough hearing loss to make it difficult for her to follow everything being said during large family gatherings. These aids are ideal for someone with slight to moderate hearing loss. The volumn controls allow for finely nuanced levels suitable for those with different needs while the long-lasting battery means that the user can go all day without worrying about loosing the support the device provides. It's also light-weight allowing for extended wear comfortably. I'd strongly recommend that anyone considering a hearing aid start his or her search looking at this one."
161,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Better then my prescription ones,"These are very nice light weight and are very sensitive, the different modes make it nice as well and compared to my expensive prescription ones i have more options and settings to help make it better plus the batteries are long lasting. my wife even noticed i didn't ask what as much anymore."
161,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Promising!,"I like this for my dad who is very picky with hearing aids. He has a decade old Siemens that got from doctor office for thousands of dollars, and while it still works, the batteries won’t charge anymore. This one we got as a replacement for him, and overall he’s happy. He was complaining about echoing of his own voice, but after adjusting the volume, he says it’s under control and much more comfortable than Siemens. Overall, I think you get a lot of bang for your money. Thanks for reading, and YMMV."
161,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Slightly disappointed,"I have used many Linner products and have been very pleased with them . These are quality made hearing amplifiers to the normal expectations that I have come to expect from Linner.  However using these with the instructions provided and without any blue tooth capabilities in my opinion, makes these difficult to use.These are not set up for blue tooth and I understood that when I ordered them. So since they do not have blue tooth ability to control them by a phone app, all controls need to be on the physical hearing amplifiers themselves. Here is my challenge.You can turn the on and off switch while the hearing aid is off your ear or while on your ear. Then you can place it in your ear canal and hang it over your ear. Once on your ear its difficult it with any dexterity issues or physical disabilities to raise or lower the volume by hand. It has 3 modes that you can change by holding a long hold on the volume button. However , nothing in the paperwork shows or tells you what mode is what so it is by trial and error to find what works best in whatever environment I am in .This maybe typical challenges for many hearing aids of this type design. However , Linner provides the same type quality in their ear bud type with blue tooth and so many more capabilities at a very similar price point. As great of quality the other Linner products have been , I expected it to be an easier control and with better instructions about how to set up the modes as to what mode is what.So in conclusion I would say that yes these are much better than many other brand RIC Hearing amplifiers that I have tried. I would have wished that they would have used the normal blue tooth app or at the least made the switches and the instructions better, easier to use. In my opinion these are good enough to recommend if you are use to physical non app aids but if you have difficulty with hand dexterity or are use to app control these may not be right for your application."
161,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not great. Bluetooth fail.,"This LINNER Nova Lite Bluetooth Hearing Aids Rechargeable would’ve been great if the Bluetooth worked, but I couldn’t get it to work for my Dad.He claims that it’s decent and I tried it too and it does magnify sound, almost like noise canceling, transparency on those music ear buds.However, he much prefers his prescription ones as they’re custom fit for his needs.These will do ok in a pinch."
161,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,You can hear a pin drop really!!,"I have normal hearing so these are not used for that by me. I use them for hunting and I can hear everything, it is crazy. When you take them out I downloaded app, paired, and was rolling. I took a hearing test in the app as well which I though was pretty cool. I have been able to hear other hunters from 100-200 yards away. They are a little pricey but I tell you what they are worth every penny. I highly recommend giving them a shot. If I can hear that good in the woods I would think someone using them as hearing aids would be blown away at home."
161,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good set of amplifiers,"Ill start by saying that the look of these earbuds is nice and they defintely feel good in your ears. You can barely notice that they are there because they are so lightweight. They do an excellent job at amplifying noises so they get the job done. The other nice thing is you dont have to wear both at the same time. If your left ear is bad, just wear the left. The other thing I noticed was I didn't get the usual echo when speaking which can be super frustrating.The charging station was a good size and I didn't have any issues with getting them in or out. In addition charging them seemed relatively quick and they held their battery life for a while. I didn't have any issues pairing them via Bluetooth which is expected nowadays.We also tried them with both an iPhone and an android and didn't experience any issues with the app."
161,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very impressive, worked well for me.",Worked very well for me. Was easy to use and setup was fast. The hearing aids are comfortable to wear and had an all day battery life for me. The carrying case which is also the changer is nice and makes them convenient.
161,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Works ok,"Works well enough for someone with basic hearing loss. They work for my grandmother, for example, but not for my grandfather. Great to have a backup pair while her primary pair are charging or being cleaned."
161,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Don't count on the bluetooth,"It is unlikely that an OTC hearing aid will ever be as good as a custom-made one because the former is designed to have a decent fit for a large  audience, rather than being tailored to your specific hearing and ear, but they are cheaper by a long way and sometimes offer additional benefits like Bluetooth.It has less than 1-second delay with both Bluetooth and world hearing. However, audio enhancement in the app causes the delay to increase up to 8 seconds.Despite having one earlobe bigger than the other, the fit is comfortable and can be worn all day without causing discomfort. This device also comes with four sizes of tips, which is one more than most other OTC hearing aids.The Android app, Linner Ha, has some useful features that you seem to can't access with just the device itself. The app allows you to change different modes for dialogue, restaurant, commute, and outdoor settings. I've only used two modes so far. Dialogue, which increases the human speech frequencies, also makes mechanical noises more apparent as they tend to share the same frequencies. (AC and fan humming for example.) The commute does the opposite, silencing speech but keeping other frequencies open so you can hear things like walking and clanking.The app also allows you to change the volume of either ear piece, which can be done on the device. It has a ""own voice surpression,"" but I find that it does nothing for my voice. It also has three EQ modes for Bluetooth, but they do not say what frequencies they boost or lower. (Default, Vocal Boost, and Theater.) A very basic hearing test can also be done in the app.The UV cleaning like is more of a selling point than a real feature. It doesn't shine on the entire tip, just about 20% of it."
161,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Decent entry level,"These aren’t bad if what you need is general amplification. Are they on par with my prescription aid? Nope. But these also cost much less. Reasonable fit. Battery seems okay. Nice charging case. No app and no Bluetooth. If you wear hearing aids all the time a Bluetooth connection can be handy for music and phone calls. If you are dealing with loss in specific frequencies rather than over all loss you may want to look at a set with an app that lets you tune the aid. Still, for the money they aren’t bad."
161,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"mininal acoustic feedback, noise suppression sometimes hit or miss, great buttons","As far as OTC hearing aids go, after trying now 16 different pairs I'm convinced Linner makes the best stuff. I've tried Linner's earbuds models as well and here's the primary reason that justifies the price point: acoustical feedback or rather lack thereof. Every grey labeled OTC aid I tried, priced between $30 and $150, blasted my ears with white noise and over-amplified background sounds. Regardless of how much their listing's hyped the technology none of them can beat Linner in this area and its not even close.Sound reproduction is crisp and characteristically flat. I can tell when the noise suppression is triggering but some things that probably should be suppressed, such as clacking of heels on hardwood, come through amplified.I appreciate the choice of buttons. Sliders and raised buttons are so much easier to use than flush set or touch sensitive ones. I also appreciate that they went with a short/long press multifunction configuration as opposed to a single/double press configuration as persons with weak hands can struggle to land the double press. Very smart choices here, cheers to the designers."
161,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice OTC hearing aids,These hearing aids work well. I really like that they can be purchased without seeing an audiologist. For minor hearing loss they really are perfect.
161,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,For the price these are an acceptable pair of OTC hearing aids,"I would first like to say that it's totally on me but I thought that these came with an app. I won't hold that against them because it was totally my mistake and not theirs. I know that there are those who don't like having to use an app and even though the pair that I did settle on does have an app, I don't have to use it. The thing is, an app brings so many features to the table that are just not possible if you don't have one. I have more hearing loss in one ear than I do in the other. The frequencies that I can hear are different too. For example, I can hear a small bell chime in one ear but not in the other. What an app does is allow me to customize the low, mid and high tones for both ears individually.There are things that I do like about these. They charge up quite fast and then last all day without a problem. I think that my favorite thing is the on/off switch. I really do prefer that over other ways to turn hearing aids off. Even though most turn on automatically they do require you to hold a button down for 5 seconds, or some such nonsense, this switch does make it a lot nicer. There is a small amount of noise cancelling similar to most of these types of hearing aids."
161,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"rechargeable, good fit, good sound quality","Overall, these are very good otc hearing aids. They are ideal for mild to moderate loss. I really like that these are rechargeable. I have had pairs that that I had to replace batteries constantly, and it is just not ideal. It was a bit of a pain. These have their own case that they charge inside. Like an earbud case, it holds charge so they can even be charged on the go if necessary. There are several volume levels to suit whatever the need. I really appreciate that they came with five different ear cup sizes to ensure the best fit for the user. They are lightweight and comfortable. I've been really impressed with the sound quality as well. It is very natural once you find the right mode/volume level. Overall, these are a great option for otc, rechargeable hearing aids if you have mild or moderate loss."
161,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Not invisible but smaller than expected,I wouldn't call these invisible but the part that goes behind your ear is smaller than depicted in the photos which is a good thing. Sound quality appears to be good. I don't have much experience with other hearing aids though so I have nothing to compare it to. I like that they are current with charging ports with using USB C. I've been phasing out micro-usb devices so I don't need multiple charging cable types or grab the wrong one in a hurry.
161,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Fully featured,"Recent changes to the law have ended the monopoly that audiologists had on the sale of hearing aids.  As a result, fully featured hearing aids that might have cost thousands of dollars can now be had for much less--as little as  $100 to $500.Obviously, hearing issues can be caused by many  things and having your hearing checked professionally is probably a good thing.  But if the issue is a simple loss of hearing due to age or prior injury, this set of hearing aids can be very helpful and not set you back very much at all.They fit comfortably, work right out of the box and will be familiar to anyone who has used ear buds. In fact, rather than try to disguise these by making them tiny and putting the electronics behind your ears (where they really stand out!) they look exactly like any pair of earbuds that your kids wear everywhere--the stigma of hearing aids has been banished forever.An app based hearing test helps you to set these up and to customize them further.  Built in bluetooth allows these to pair easily with your phone and other devices.  You can use these to make phone calls directly with your phone.I have moderate age-based hearing loss and have trouble following conversations in noisy environments. The amplification is excellent--speech stands out clearly against background noise and following a TV show is easy and not stressful. Wearing these to dinner allowed me to hear conversations that I would have strained to hear without them and I could easily overhear conversations at adjacent tables.  I turned down the volume to exclude the unwanted noise.You kind of don't realize what you are missing until you try these."
161,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great performance from an ""off the shelf"" solution","short of a custom fitted hearing aid, this is probably the best hearing amplification solution i've come across. the battery pack holds a great charge, and the volume control is easy to reach and adjust.the sound amplification comes across nice and clear, even at the extremes of the adjustments.there WAS slight feedback that happens from time to time, but definitely less than you would normally get from a regular hearing aid, so the function does work, just not perfect."
161,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Lightweight and long battery life,"I gave the Mercury to my dad as a gift since he has been looking for a good product to help with his hearing. After trying a bunch of different hearing aids, I would say that the Mercury is the best for his needs.He says that it is so lightweight and small that it feels like he isn’t wearing it. The battery life is also very good that he wears it at least 14 hours a day without hanging to worry about charging it. He also likes the noise cancelling feature as he says that conversations are now crisp and without interference.Overall, I’m very happy with the product and will definitely buy another one as backup for him. For the price, the Mercury is the best product out there for its category."
161,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great experience---I can even hug people without getting feedback noise!,"After struggling with other brands and having to cope with feedback, ear buds falling out etc. I switched to Linner over-the-ear and it's been smooth sailing!  I'm ecstatic!  I had tried the ear buds of different brands and numerous size domes and they still didn't fit well or work well.  Linner aids have been such a pleasure to use.  I hug people with NO FEEDBACK of whistling!  Such a pleasure to hear well and not be wrestling with touchy aids.  My husband and I are both  thrilled with the improved hearing life together.  Also...great price!  I heartily recommend them."
161,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound quality,"I purchased this hearing aid for my dad, he has moderate hearing loss in both ears. The device provides exceptionally clear sound, and the audio quality is impressive. My dad now wears it while chatting with friends and watching TV, significantly enhancing his overall quality of life. Highly recommend Linner to any one with moderate hearing loss same as my dad."
161,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fantastic,"This is a state of art piece despite the most comfortable ones to wear for long period of time, it comes with crisp clear sound. The battery life is a plus as well, as if it can last life time. Thanks for the life saver, love it!!"
161,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,,Me gustaron hestos audífonos se olla muy claro y oigo muy vien los recomiendo
161,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,Way too loud for me!,"I have mild to moderate hearing loss. It says they are made for that in the online description. However, in the written instructions when you receive them it very clearly says only for severe hearing loss. Also it has a few different modes which is great, but it doesn’t tell you which is which, or when it is best to use each. Lastly for cons it has the WORST hissing! I’m giving it two stars only because it comes with everything you need and the are small, discreet, and comfortable. Sadly no use for me and will be returning!"
161,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Linner Mercury Hearing Aids are well made!,The sound and clarity are excellent! The wear time vs the charge time is exceptional! These are simple for any age and provide for moderate hearing loss. Well worth the price!
161,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good quality,The product is of good quality and very helpful. Easy to use.
161,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,,"Un producto de calidad, 100% recomendado."
161,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great products!!!,This product help me a lot for my hearing loss
161,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Do not recommend,Worked only for a few days before the left device wouldn’t charge.
161,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Impossible to wear.,"Sorry to say, I could not get the ear plug to stay in my ear. It popped out from  the ear canal."
161,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Impossible to use,"Noisy, uncomfortable, unnatural sound, impossible because ambient noise is so dominant it blocks out conversations. Returned to Amazon."
161,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Discret design,"I ordered these for my mom who has some hearing loss from age. She is a bit difficult when it comes to learning new things. She stated she thought hearing aids would be helpful so before spending a large amount on ones from the doctor, she tried these OTC hearing aids. I must say I don't think she gave them a fair shot. She tried them a few times and became frustrated with how weird she felt she sounded while talking and wearing them. I explained it takes time for the brain to adjust. She experience some reverb so we tried different size ear pieces. She also complained about static. She seemed to have trouble no matter what she tried. I'd like to point out, I am not sure she is a great example of a typical experience. So at this point she has given up on wearing them. But I doubt it is the product. I think she just doesn't have such bad hearing that she's willing to wear these. The hearing aids seem straight forward. The controls seem simple. Quality appears to be high. Included are several ear piece sizes, cleaning tool and extra tips. The case has a convenient magnetic connection that sort of locks them in to charge. They hold a charge for a good amount of time. The case is small and can be brought on the go for additional charging. And they look pretty discrete while wearing."
161,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Comfortable, amplifies sound well, battery last for a while","Two thing I will say right off the bat is that you should still talk with a doctor before getting hearing aids. These are more of an amplifier and you should see if it is the best for you via doctor recommendation. THe next thing is that this is NOT water proof. It should not be worn while swimming. My dad has been suffering from hearing lost so I actually got these for him after my doctor recommended he get some hearing aids. They are more of an amplifier but it works pretty well for him so far. It will not work for severe case of Otosclerosis as my mom did try this and it did not work well for her. The first thing I will say about these is that the device cannot be connected to your phone so you are not able to control it through your phone. It also may not work well if you are using your phone next to your ear. The controls are on the hearing aids/amplifiers themselves. It did take time for my dad to get use to the control. He had to take them off quite a few times because he didn't know how to change certain settings.  These hearing aids look very similar to the ones I saw as a kid but it blends in a bit better due to the small size. They are more comfortable but they can be a bit fragile on the wires so try not to yank it super hard. It also take some setup due to you needing to adjust the sound to your liking. These stayed on my dad's head pretty well. He was able to move around with these on so they do not fall off. It was pretty loud from just the initial setting so try to check the sound before putting it into your ears.  I do like the charging case that comes with it. The case itself has its own battery so you can charge the headset on the go when needed. They last for quite sometime but cannot be charged without the case so be aware of that. They take a few hours to charge to full. You can actually use one while the other charges if you wanted. It fits easily into the case and clamps shut. There is no bluetooth so it does not cut off any kind of connection. It provides a good protective case for the headphones when you are not using them at night. There is an LED indicator on the front to show you charging level of the case and both hearing aids. The sound is pretty good and it is clear. There is no robotic noise of feedback. Overall this hearing aid is really nice. I am impressed with how the sound is amplified. It is clear, loud, and effective. You can adjust the sound accordingly but there is no mode (movie mode or such) so you do need to make adjustments accordingly to your situation. The color is pretty nice and does make it harder to see the headphones on your head. It is also very comfortable and easy to wear all day without causing any irritation or fatigue."
161,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Works ok,These work ok for the price but occasionally I lose connection in one ear.
161,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Decent hearing aids,These are decent hearing aids that come with a charging case. They are lightweight and comfortable to wear. I think they are fairly hidden due to their size. The controls were a bit difficult to use at first. I had to reference the instructions fairly often when adjusting. Sounds come in loud and fairly clear. It’s noticeable that sound is artificially amplified though.
161,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Decent rechargable hearing aids,"I have tried multiple hearing aids and hate the non-rechargeable ones where you have to keep replacing the tiny batteries.  These are rechargeable in their case and  the charge always lasts as long as I want to use them  They fit nicely in my ears and the sound quality is acceptable.  They have multiple levels of volume control, which is critical to not get that terrible feedback squeal.  Some hearing aids that I have tried sound way to tinny, but these provide more midrange and bass.  Of all of the different hearing aids that I have tried, these are my current favorites."
161,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great Hearing Aids For The Price, Could Use Better Documentation/Explanation","These hearing aids do help enhance sounds and boost hearing.  Right out of the box they are usable.  The box includes the hearing aids, charging box, replacement ear domes & tips.  I was able to take them out of the box, turn them on, put them in and I started hearing more of my surroundings immediately.  They have 8 volume levels that are accessed by pressing the rocker button below the power button on each hearing aid, the top button is volume up and the bottom button is volume down.  That required no instructions or documentation.  That said, these hearing aids have features that have little to no explanations, such as the 3 modes that they reference on their ad.  In their manual they call them programs:  P1 – normal output, p2 – low frequency cut and high frequency cut, p3 – high frequency cut.  It doesn’t mention why you might need these different programs and/or what they do, just that you can change them.  I will add that the programs are listed farther back in the book and nowhere near where they are talking about the button on the hearing aid or how to operate them.  The book mentions the replacement tips but mention nowhere in the book about how to replace the tips.  If you dig online, there is a video about it.  Maybe if I had ever had hearing aids, I would already know these things but since I’m new to the whole concept I need everything spelled out to me and that just isn’t the case here, so I feel like I’m missing out on the full use.  Ok, all of that said, we had wanted to see if these might help my mother-in-law who is 90 years old.  She can hear some but not a lot.  She got frustrated with the fact that, due to her arthritis, she couldn’t operate the tiny buttons.  She said that they didn’t really help her either.  While I do think those things are things to consider when finding a viable option, I don’t find either to be a fault of the hearing aids.  To be small and concealable that necessitates the small size of the buttons, and they are advertised as for mild to moderate hearing loss.  I wasn’t sure where the line between moderate and sever hearing loss lie but evidentially, she has severe hearing loss, so these weren’t really for her.  When I use them, I can certainly tell that they enhance my hearing, so for the price, I think they are well worth the money.  I really wish that the documentation was written more for a person that is totally ignorant of hearing aids, as that’s what I am, and I don’t feel like I’m alone.  Understanding how they work is the key to being able to use them.  I’m just glad that I have the ability, know how, and will to find the information needed but I’m afraid many people do not."
161,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great alternative to the more expensive ones,"Pros:Good sound quality.Good fit (for my Mom)Cons:For some reason, they looked a bit scratched when they arrived, but after having it replaced, they all looked the same. Not something that affects the sound quality or anything.Other thoughts:My Mom had to buy some hearing aids and was quoted the more expensive ones. However, I decided to get this one and see if it helped. Otherwise, we would end up getting the more expensive one. Well, I can report that my Mom loves it, as she can hear very well and the fit end up being really good."
161,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Ease of use, sound quality.  It’s a great product.","I have been disappointed in a number of hearing aids but Linner Mercury OTC is really good.  I turn them on each day after it has been charged up and wear them all day.  No adjustments needed after your initial  set up.  Shut them off before recharging them at the end of the day.  It is a natural sound that I hear.  Voices, birds tweeting, a dog barking outside, a whisper from a grandchild.  They are great."
161,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,So far so good.....great choice for the price point,Came with all the needed accessories.  I am new to hearing aids but wanted to try a nicely priced OTC option before seeking a prescription hearing aid.  These definitely fit that need. Amplification can be quite loud but I simply pull the bud to the edge of my ear and I get excellent results.
161,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Correct fit. Works great.,"I am a 30 year hearing aide user. After being told that I am not deaf enough for medicare to pay for cochlear implants I ordered these from INNER, a brand I did not know.The ear bud is perfect. I need my canals blocked while the tiny speaker delivers audible words and other sounds. These double-wall buds with a little stirrup on the tip fully block other noise.The tiny wire from behind my ear to the speaker is rigidly shaped at the bud end. This makes it easier for my old crooked fingers to direct the bud into my ear canal. The tiny wire with the rigid shape ALSO helps keep the bud in my ear while eating or talking. These activities work the jawbone around and can make poor fitting ear buds become misaligned with the canal.The behind-the-ear portion is smaller than any of my former pairs. The hard case for charging is a plus. Interior magnets pull the unit into place for charging. Nice engineering!I am two weeks into these aides and I'm giving them 5 stars."
161,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very fast shipping and a good product,"I bought this product to replace an OTC RIC set that I had bought several years ago, one of them quit working and which are no longer sold on Amazon. This are very well built and not cheap looking. They are small and hide well. I find the on and off switch a plus. The feed back noises are so far at a minimum which also a big plus, I can scratch my ear without getting feed back :)  The charging case is small enough to fit in a pocket. I have only used a few days but so far I like em and are a fit for me. I would definitely buy these again and will recommend to anyone with mild to moderate hearing loss…"
161,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not water resistant,"The hearing aids are working good so far. In the online discretion it states that they are extremely water resistant, but in the booklet that came with them it clearly states, that hearing aids are not water resistant and one should be very careful not to get them wet.Description also states that the hearing aids automatically cut on when removing them out of the case and that they automatically cut off when put back in the case, Not true! Each hearing aid has an on and off switch on them.Not that any off this makes a whole lot of difference, other than stating that they are highly water resistant. BS"
161,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,A big help; better than similar products,"These are very nice hearing aids; better in many ways than others I have tried. Charging is quick and efficient,battery life is great, and most of the time, the sound has been quite clear.  These worked consistently, not cutting in and out like the last pair of over the counter hearing aids I tried.  The controls are easy to use and work reliably.  The hearing aids are light and feel comfortable, even with glasses. It's great that these come with 3 different hearing modes which can be adjusted quickly and discreetly. I really like that the hearing aids have an on/off button, which was not the case with my disposable battery hearing aids.At first I had some feedback problems with these in louder environments, and had to turn the volume way down to stop that, but the problems haven't recurred.The one problem I have with these is that they amplify everything, so though speech sounds louder, I don't find it much easier to understand speech in certain challenging situations. Also, my understanding is that over the counter hearing aids are only available for mind to moderate hearing loss, and yet these say that they are for those in the severe range; I'm not sure what that means.Overall, these are a great help in many everyday situations, and are pleasant and convenient to use. The current price is much lower than even some of the over the counter products. They could be a good introduction to hearing aids for someone who is not sure whether to go for the expensive prescription models."
161,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great hearing aids!,"As someone who has struggled with moderate to severe hearing loss for years, I've cycled through my fair share of hearing aids, always searching for ""the one"" that would bring the world back into focus without shouting, ""I'm wearing a hearing aid!"" So, it's with great excitement that I share my experience with the Linner Mercury RIC Hearing Aids.The 16-channel digital processing promised a lot, and it delivered even more. Conversations now have an incredible crispness to them, and I'm no longer constantly asking others to repeat themselves. The voice enhancement is so natural that I sometimes forget I'm wearing hearing aids.The adaptive feedback control is a standout feature. My old hearing aids used to give me an echo, especially in large rooms, but these give me a seamless, echo-free listening experience. I can enjoy my book club discussions and family dinners without any annoying reverberation.The three modes and eight volume settings have been a godsend. Whether I'm in a noisy restaurant or having a quiet chat on my porch, I can adjust the settings easily to fit the situation. The noise reduction technology really does its job, making it possible to focus on the conversation at hand without the distracting background noise.The design is discreet and lightweight, which I love. The comfort is next-level – I can wear them all day without any irritation. Plus, the controls are a breeze to use; I can adjust the settings without having to take them out or fiddle around too much.These hearing aids aren't just a medical device; they're a lifestyle enhancement. I'm more engaged in conversations, I'm not exhausted from trying to hear all day, and I'm not worried about my hearing aids being an eyesore. If you're on the fence about trying a new hearing aid, I can't recommend these enough. They've truly improved my quality of life."
161,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,,Esto fue un regalo para mi mamá ya que tiene problemas auditivos. A la semana de usarlos dejaron de funcionar y hacer sonidos raros
161,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice sound pickup,Could for me use soft close ear dome but everthing else is fine sound gaulity is good and great value for the money
161,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good for the money,I have used so many different brands at all price levels and these are very good all around d hearing aids. They do have a tendency to be a little louder on the higher spectrum of sound.
161,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,grew to like it,"very sleek and functionally designed pair. and it has a very good sound quality to match. the noise cancellation works great for me when i need it most but it hasn't been my top feature that i look for in hearing amps. it feels pretty comfortable for the most part and when i compare it to previously owned or cheaper running models that i still have, it's been working better overall for me personally."
161,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Enhanced hearing,"I got these to replace another set I have been using for a couple years, and so far these are working great. I like that these are smaller than some I have used in the past. It has the same basic setup with the ear buds connected to a plastic control panel/microphone that goes over the ear. If you've worn OTC hearing aids before it will be familiar, but these have a thinner connecting wire than some and a smaller plastic over the ear piece that makes it a little less bulkyThe sound quality of these is impressive. It has 8 volume levels to meet different preferences and the audio clarity is great. It does a good job filtering out unwanted noise and clarifying voices. It is great for when watching TV or during conversation, and just generally helps enhance clarity and volume for anyone who has diminished hearingThese come in a charging case that charges via USB C cable. The aids automatically charge when placed in the case, so you do have to make sure to keep the box charged especially if you are going to be away from a charger. The battery does last a good while. They worked for me all day on one charge so you shouldn't need to charge them throughout the dayThe functionality is pretty straightforward. There is a button for raising or lowering the volume as well as a power button. Included are several replacement rubber ear pieces. There are 3 different operating modes, but I am not really sure what the difference is between them. I didn't notice a huge difference between the modes, but it probably makes a difference depending on the listening environment. I plan on playing around with it some more to see if I prefer one mode over anotherOverall I am really happy with these as a replacement for my last bulky set. The sound is better and I like the smaller size for a less obvious look"
161,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good amplification; decent sound quality; some background noise,"Short summary:These hearing amplifiers do a decent job in amplifying sound, although there is a bit more background noise than I'd like. The sounds that are amplified are not as clear and crisp as I'd like.They work great in Bluetooth mode, as I stream music from my phone.More details:This Hearing Amplifier includes a user guide with good details and illustrations to help me figure out how to use this product.At its most basic feature, to use:1. I remove the hearing amplifiers from the charging case, and put them in my ears. It automatically powers on (when placed back in the case, it powers off)2. I press a button to increase volume, and the other button to decrease volume.To fully use all the features for these hearing amplifiers, I downloaded the app, as follows:1. I downloaded ""Linner Nova"" app from the Google Playstore2. I allowed access to my phone's bluetooth function, and then selected the ""lite"" option from the 3 choices on the app.3. While the app searched for Linner Nova-lite, I clicked on my phone's Bluetooth icon, then selected ""pair new device"", and clicked on ""linner nova lite"". After a few seconds, I hear a voice that says ""connected"".The app then opens, showing the volume on left and right amplifier. I can tap (-) or (+) to increase or decrease volume.I can choose 1 of 4 modes: Dialogue, restaurant, commute, outdoor.There is option for ""own voice suppression"" - I can select on or off.There is option for mix mode, for audio enhancement, and for media EQ (default, vocal boost, theater).note: all these features are further explained in the manual.I also took the hearing test - this works well.While there are 4 modes, the Restaurant mode, which is supposed to have high noise reduction, didn't do so, as I could still hear quite a bit of the ambient noises.When I use the bluetooth function (for instance, to stream music from my phone), I control the volume via the volume buttons on my phone.Overall, these are decent hearing amplifiers, for when I need sound amplification."
161,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Nice product and can hear!,"I'm pleasantly surprised at how straightforward it was to set up these hearing aids using the app on my phone. I've noticed a significant improvement in my ability to hear conversations with people, and my family members no longer have to repeat themselves, which is a relief. So far, I'm quite impressed with the quality of these hearing aids, especially given their more affordable price when compared to some of the other brands available. I'm giving them four stars!"
161,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good battery and noise cancellation,I got these for my father who has moderate hearing loss. These are a comfortable fit for him and he can now hear better. He specially loves the noise cancellation feature which makes the voice more clear for him. Battery lasts for over 12 hours so enough for him to go through his day. He really likes these for everyday use.
161,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Work As Advertised,"These work well and are simple to use. Charging is also easy to do and battery life is long. Volume may be loud at times but is adjustable. Easy to program. My issue is getting my dad to use these, he thinks his hearing is OK (it is not). I set these all up for him and he did try them and stated results were good. That's the last time he wore them... Anyway, great item, works as advertised."
161,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good Appearance, But Still Has Some Background Noise","I really like the appearance of these, especially the fact that they're black because they really look cool in my opinion. The size of the hearing aid is compact and comfortable to wear, and I like the fact that it doesn't look like a typical hearing aid but instead resembles an ear bud, etc. There are also different sizes of ear domes included so that you can get the proper fit.The storage case acts as a charging case, and it's small enough to easily fit inside your pocket. The device uses a Type C charging cable which is included, but the charging head isn't. It takes approximately an hour to get a full charge, but the charge only lasts approximately 5-6 hours before needing to be recharged. One innovative feature of the charging case is the UV-C lamp which sterilizes the hearing aids while they're charging, so it helps to minimize the amount of bacteria.The volume can easily be adjusted on the side of each hearing aid, which is great if you have better hearing in one ear, etc. Unfortunately you'll need to download the app to adjust any of the other settings. This may present a problem for any senior who still uses a flip phone (like my father). And for those seniors who have joined the smartphone revolution, the app is pretty user friendly.As for the sound quality, it's a mixed bag. They do work well, but I am a little surprised at the amount of background noise. The hearing aids are helpful overall, though. One thing to keep in mind is that the hearing aids work well for someone with mild to moderate hearing loss; but for someone with severe hearing loss such as my father, they may not be the best option. They're basically just going to help amplify the sound, but probably won't be a magic cure."
161,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Over the Counter with Similarities More Expensive Custom,"I was happy to see these Linner OTC Mercury Hearing Aids come with various tips because you may need a smaller tip in one ear than the other.They are easy to charge.  The case doesn’t need to be charged daily.  The hearing aids slide in an connect magnetically.  If your case opens and it tumbles a bit, the hearing aids stay safely inside.This set of Linner hearing aids is small.  The part that goes behind your ear isn’t much larger than some more expensive prescription type hearing aids.I didn’t get much feedback while wearing them. I was able to amplify the sounds around me by pushing the buttons.  It does take some fiddling around with.  There is no Bluetooth/app for adjusting the hearing aids which did not bother me, but if you want to adjust your hearing aids easily thru an app you may want to look for something else. When changing through the modes, I wasn’t sure where it was starting.  The tones heard in my ear alerted me to it being changed, but I didn’t notice much difference.  It says they can be noise cancelling as well but I didn’t notice it at all.I think they are a fashionable, useful otc set of hearing aids with features of more expensive ones."
161,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,There are some cons but the pros outweighs the cons,- These are good quality hearing amplifiers and a little more. These not only look like earphones but you can also listen to music with these which i think is a pretty cool feature.- These hearing amplifiers does do a good job at amplifying the sound however i feel these are not really good at reducing background noise. I expected better. It is pretty decent though.- There are different modes to choose from depending on the type of environment you are in but in order to select the modes you need to download an app and control from your phone. I ordered these hearing amplifiers for my dad and he is not very good with technology so this is feature is a disadvantage for him. I wish there were buttons on the hearing aids to make this switch.- There are buttons on the hearing aids to control the volume on both sides which is nice because they are independent. This is especially helpful if you have one ear a little more off compared to the other.- For the price i wish the battery life was better. If you wear this continuously you will have to charge it very frequently. I have tried hearing amplifiers much cheaper than this one but with a battery life of up to 4 days.- It is quite difficult to pull these hearing amplifiers out of the case. This is difficult especially for my dad who has thicker fingers.- I love the ease of having these turn on automatically when you remove them from the case and automatically turning off when you put them back in the case. They are always ready to use as long as they are charged. This is especially convenient for my dad.- Overall these are good quality hearing amplifiers. There are some cons but i guess the pros outweigh the cons here. My dad has tried a couple of hearing amplifiers and these are his favorite mainly because of the convenience of use.
161,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Bluetooth Hearing Aids with built in UV lamp,"The media could not be loaded.
                



Its exciting to get hearing aids that double as bluetooth microphones. Not only do these help with sounds from the environment around you, you can easily connect them to your phone or any other blue tooth device. The app is easy to install and fairly straight forward on how to use. Not fully understanding some of the features in the app I found that selecting the option and giving a listen helped.The Bluetooth aids have either red or blue colors on them to indicate which ear. Remember, RED for your Right ear. (both words start with the letter R). While listening to music on my phone with these I found that I could control not only the volume but I could pause the music, answer, hang up or even refuse a phone call. This will be VERY convenient when I'm out on the tractor cutting grass and in my zone while listening to music and a phone call comes in.The case that comes with these Bluetooth hearing aids has a smart feature that starts a UV light to disinfect the hearing aids when you put them into their spots in the case.They do help with the sounds and the environment around you and the app does give you different options to choose from to refine your hearing experience.While it is a premium product the only thing that I found to be disappointing is that I was born with small ears and my ears started to hurt. These may be better suited for people with more normal or larger ears. But other then that the Linner Novia Lite Bluetooth Hearing Aids are a good starter into the world of hearing aids."
161,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good hearing amplifiers,"My father tested this and considered them good hearing amplifiers but not a replacement for medical hearing aids. For people with mild hearing loss these are perfect, because they amplify the sound around them enough, they look nice comparing to the medical ones. They have good noise cancellation, load volume, and easily adjustable via the app. The charging case works great and is very convenient. The main challenge for people with moderate hearing loss is being able to get specific frequencies in noisy situations. The application has specific modes helping a bit, but not that effective for people like my father who wear hearing aids for years. That’s why medical ones get adjusted by professionals in the office to match the patient situation."
161,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Exactly as described!,Exactly as described and pictured. Very nice quality with noise cancellation and improved sound. The battery life is long lasting. This is a very nice and possible more affordable alternative to expensive hearing aids. Two thumbs up.
161,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good Aid for Mid Range Hearing Impairment,"Having once checked out a hearing aid at a box store that hit the two thousand cost I was eager to see how this is.  I was surprised how small it was and easily sits almost hidden behind my ears with just an extremely thin wire coming over to the ear. Putting them on I was surprised at what was picked up and hearing more sounds around me.  I do have to admit that it can, at first, be a little strange hearing so much going around you and even hearing my own voice.  I was in another room when I heard a faucet dripping that I would not have heard otherwise.  Watching TV I could hear dialogue quite a bit better but when listening to music it picked up some percushing sound I would not have heard but did cut back the base. Compared to a headset for music and TV the headset was better, but for everyday use this will come in handy especially after using for a while to get used to it.  Finally I see this as an aid for those who do not have to use hearing aids all the time but in some instances need a little help.  I can’t say I will use it all the time as I don’t need all those extra sound distractions but it could help in a car giving you an extra safety edge. It will help in a room with others speaking making it easy to better hear the person you are talking to.  It is easy to put on and take off so no reason not to use it when needed.  With its price and technology it can give one some confidence when needed."
161,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good Hearing Aid,"So far, the hearing aid is feature-rich hearing aid, and honestly, I'd love to give it five stars. However, due to my initial experience, I'd like to give it four stars, in the hope that the app or user manual can be improved. To begin with, when I first used it, I downloaded the app as per the instructions. However, after the connect button, it consistently prompted me to enable the app's Bluetooth functionality, even though I had already enabled it. It turned out that it didn't connect directly via Bluetooth. After some trial and error, I realized that, similar to regular headphones, I had to manually go to my phone's Bluetooth settings to find and pair with it. Once paired, it connected seamlessly.Now, let's highlight the significant advantages of this hearing aid. It's user-friendly for basic use, as it comes with built-in volume adjustment buttons. However, what I really like is the variety of preset scenes within the app, offering effective noise reduction without amplifying background noise excessively. For instance, in non-quiet environments, I highly recommend selecting the ""outdoor"" scene, as it effectively filters out less relevant sounds.Moreover, it features two charging methods - USB-C and wireless charging. It offers eight levels of sound amplification, which, in my opinion, works quite well for a standard hearing aid. I can adjust the amplification level separately for each ear to cater to individual needs. It's comfortable to wear, and there are various earplug options for customization.One minor point to note is that it tends to produce feedback whistling when it's very close to the charging case, but this only occurs when the hearing aid is being put back into the case."
161,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,HEARING AMPLIFIERS WITH LONG BATTERY LIFE,"Recently I experienced a sudden and noticeable loss of hearing in my right ear. The loss seems to be in certain frequencies and I was looking for a hearing amplifier that could boost those lost frequencies. These hearing amplifiers have 9 volume settings and 3 program settings. After turning them on and inserting them in my ear I found it easy enough to adjust the volume and set the different programs, but I did not find a difference between the 3 programs in how clearly I heard and I felt that they were only making the muddied hearing in my right ear louder rather than clearer. The 3 modes are briefly mentioned in the instruction booklet but there is no real explanation of how they are different and what they could be expected to do in real life situations. It would be very helpful if these units were blue tooth enabled but they are not and no external adjustment is possible. I have tried other units that paired with my phone for frequency by frequency adjustment but these did not. I did not find them really helpful for me."
161,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Works well, noise-cancellation, 20-h use, good controls, comfortable","These works well for me, with useful modes and with effective “active” noise cancellation. The 20-hour battery life is more than i use at a time. I recharge them every night. These are pretty comfortable."
161,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent sound quality,When I found this product I was able to figure out they were hearing amplifiers. They do just what I need so perfect for my issues! These hearing amplifiers are a great size. They are really durable and have a long lasting design. They charge up quickly and there is usually always clear noise. The sound quality is excellent! I’m very satisfied with how this worked out. It’s such a well made hearing amplifier!
161,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Comfortable to wear, work  - confusing for elderly","These are comfortable to wear and do a great job of amplifying sound, but you do need the app to make them work their best and it was very confusing to try and explain it to my 76-year-old father. I could get it set up for him, but as soon as I left and he wanted to use it later, he couldn't keep it straight on how to work them.  They are also very pricy at almost $300. They work, but for that price I wish they had a simplified operation for older people."
161,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Bluetooth hearing amplifiers and wireless ear buds, app crashes",I like the look and feel of these Bluetooth hearing amplifiers. They do a really good job at picking up and amplifying sounds in either ear or both. With many of these amplifiers they also amplify my own voice when speaking which can be a little echoey and take sometime to get used to.They are extremely difficult to pull out of the charging case and that might be hard for some. They fit in my ear nicely and both have individual volume settings.They paired easily with my phone and also function as normal wireless earbuds when connected to Bluetooth. When playing audio from my phone it does not amplify but when my phone stops playing audio it automatically amplifies again.  There is a mixed mode that allows mixing amplified sound and Bluetooth audio if desired.The app is required to switch modes. Unfortunately I could not get the app to work on my Android phone. The app continues to crash whenever I try to open it..
161,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Work well if you get them snug enough,"These work extremely well at improving the audio as long as you get them into your ears well enough. You will get that awful screeching as the echo into the mic occurs if you don't get them on just right. They did not last a full 12 hours for me butt around 10, which is still plenty good enough for a rechargeable hearing aid for me! Higher volumes does introduce a bit of static noise but unless you are getting super high end hearing aids you will always get that from my experience. Keep the volume at a decent level and you will be fine. Give your body time to adjust also or you will not be a happy camper. I think they normally say about a week to get accustomed to the new sounds you can hear. They work very well for what they are."
161,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,These Work Surprisingly Well,"I have wanted to try hearing aids for a long time, but insurance doesn't cover the expense in my state, and I was unwilling to invest thousands of dollars.  I am satisfied with these.  I don't know how my hearing loss would be classified.  These are simple and straightforward to use.  They come in a USB-C chargeable case, bigger than your typical earbuds.  I put them in my ear and played with the settings and volume until they suited me well.  I only use them around the house, and it's great to hear the TV and all the conversation.  I did not realize how much I was missing.  They are a hit with my family, who do not have to listen to the TV so loud, and I am answering questions that were asked, not what I thought they said.  They charge fast, and the battery has never been an issue.  They are good quality and well-designed but get uncomfortable after a few hours.  I also have to take one out to sleep on the couch while listening to TV, which I do most nights, but I love that I can hear the news while falling asleep.  These are exceptional values for the price.  As I get older and my hearing worsens, I would invest in a better pair, but the work is perfect now with limited use."
161,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great Bluetooth Hearing Aids!,"These are impressive hearing aids! This would make a wonderful gift for a loved one who is starting to struggle with hearing.  Everything from the packaging to the ease of use will impress the recipient!This Bluetooth Hearing Aid set comes complete with everything you need to get set up and improve hearing. I love that these can also be used as Bluetooth headphones, so the person struggling with hearing will be using them to listen to audiobooks or music and become accustomed to using these. Brilliant!These do have a bit of a learning curve, both technologically and physically. It's a different skill to listen through the hearing aids, and not everyone is comfortable with advanced technology.This is an ideal gift for a loved one struggling with hearing. Pair this with some loving tech support, and you've really got something! I hope this helps! Enjoy!"
161,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Better than some other modestly priced units,I found that these hearing aids are slightly better than some other modestly priced ones. The controls are somewhat easier to use and the sound quality is pretty good. I'm at a point where I think you need hearing aids prescribed and calibrated by a professional to really improve your hearing. This is a more affordable alternative in the event that you can't afford to do that.
161,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,The best I've used but they are not Bluetooth!?,"Hello friends, I selected this set of linner mercury invisible hearing aids for hearing loss.Overall, this is a really great set of hearing aids for the price. The best at this price point I have used.  They reduce the shrieking that can come with using cheaper hearing aids.  They are small and charge usb-c, which I appreciate.  The blue is a nice color too. The thing is with hearing aids the controls are really hard to use as they are so tiny.  I can handle using them but I know many who cannot. At three hundred bucks at the time of this review. I'm disappointed this set is not Bluetooth enabled.  They respectfully should be."
161,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Enhancing the overall hearing experience.,"These hearing aids, designed for individuals dealing with mild to moderate hearing loss, have brought a level of convenience and enhancement that has truly made a difference.The adaptability of these hearing aids is remarkable, featuring four distinct audio modes tailored to different listening environments.  Even in challenging acoustic environments, the LINNER Hearing Aids deliver clear and intelligible sound. The inclusion of a charging case with a built-in UV-C light is a thoughtful addition, automatically sanitizing the hearing aids when placed back into the case."
161,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Priceless Gift: Improved Hearing for Uncle,"I gifted this product to my favorite uncle, who was in need of new hearing aids. His old ones were not functioning properly, so I ordered these for him. According to his explanation, they are significantly better than his previous ones. He expressed that he can now enjoy his favorite shows and was grateful to me as he had been saving up for new hearing aids. I'm not sure why hearing aids are so expensive, but I suppose you can't put a price on a device that contributes to a person's health and overall well-being."
161,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great hearing aids,These hearing aids work so well.  The sound quality is crisp and clear.  I am able to hear things I haven't been able to in a long time.  I wish the battery was a bit better but for the quality of the product it is ok.  I really like how discrete these are and how effective they are.  I find them easy to use and the instructions were clear and easy to follow.  I wear these every day and have no more issues with missing out on conversations or programs.  I also like that they look like headphones so it is not obvious I am wearing them.  I highly recommend these!
161,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,great budget OTC option,"these come with all of the different adapters to fit all ear sizes.  i was easily able to find one that fits my needs.  they're fairly straightforward and simple to use, sound great, and have good noise cancelation.  they're a great value over other options that are more expensive.  the only drawback i could find was the placement of the controls.  its a bit hard to change things without taking them out, but i may be able to do so over time after i get use to them."
161,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Adaptability and comfort.,"Dealing with mild to moderate hearing loss, I was on the lookout for a solution that seamlessly integrates into my daily life, enhancing both my TV-watching sessions and call clarity. Whether I'm watching TV or engaging in a regular call, these hearing aids deliver clear and bright sound, even in challenging acoustic environments."
161,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Comfortable to wear and quick charge,"LINNER Mercury OTC Hearing Aids Rechargeable - Noise Cancellation, 3 Modes, 8 VolumeUnlike some other hearing amplifiers, these are not bluetooth, making external adjustments impossible. However, adjusting while wearing is a lot easier that other models also.  So there is a bit of a trade-off.  The aids arrived already charged and ready to go.  There is a quick-guide and a user manual, but neither explain the difference in the 3 modes or how these modes are accessed.  I did not hear any differences at all.  Maybe its a simple combination of mode and volume?  In either case, I did find that the volume level was easily achieved, and the noise-cancellation was very effective.  All in all, I am able to hear sounds better and more clearly; I am able to better distinguished one voice from another; charging is very quick and holds the charge for a longer time period; includes many tips and domes, charging cable, and a cleaner brush.  Overall, though I would prefer it to be bluetoothed enabled, this is a very good hearing aid amplifier and I would recommend."
105,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works wonderfully for me.,"This is the first over-the-counter hearing aid system that has worked well for me, right out of the box. It is a natural fit (make sure you know right from left) and the amplification was exactly what I needed, without my making any adjustment.  The battery has also consistently held up for me for a full day after a charge. As with any of these hearing aids, there will be a whistle if you put your hand up to your ear or if you otherwise  close off the area around a ear (such as by placing the side of your head against the back of a couch.  That is the kind of thing you have to get used to avoiding if you are using a hearing amplification system.I have read the other five-start reviews (thus far), and I agree with them concerning the functionality of this product."
105,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good amplification,"I am comparing to the $3000 pair from an ENT and I lost one and bought these. This set is easy to use, came set up to fit my ears. I have used 3 of the 4 programs. A little tunnel sound with traffic noise but for $2500 less, no problem. I have had them for a week and find I wear them more often than the previous, expensive set. Have rarely gotten feedback sounds. I just remembered I have to go put them on!"
105,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Defective product,I bought Otofonix Helix hearing aid. Open the box and put both hearing aid for charge. The right side would not charge or show the charging light indicator. Called customer service but could not resolve problem. I return the item.
105,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not what I expected,"The hearing aids fit well and the charging is efficient and convenient.  The problem for me has been feedback, high pitched squealing when listening to live music and in a loud environment. Okay for TV but adjustment for volume level does not have much range."
105,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Customer service stinks,"Lost my hearing aid when I took of my mask, my fault. Didn’t notice because they are very comfortable, good for Otofonix. When I called to see if I could buy another one, I was told they only sell them as a sets. Don’t understand why they sell so many of these and don’t have a couple hanging around to help when something like this happens. I’m sure I’m not the only one who has had a similar problem. They are a nice hearing aid, but they have really bad after market support. Buyer Beware !!!!!!!!"
105,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Price is $150 cheaper today (one month after purchase),"Update. I purchased these one month ago and have been very pleased. Went to Amazon to order more tubes/earpieces and discovered that the price for the same set of aids has dropped $150. I'm returning mine and will reorder at the cheaper price.I hate to say that Otofonix is playing pricing games, but it sure looks like that to me - a 69 year-old senior on a fixed income.I have tried the cheap amplifiers and they were a waste of time and money. Was tested by an audiologist who recommended $5,000 hearing aids. I couldn't afford those, although they worked amazingly well. Found the otofonix website searching for a reasonable solution. At 1/10th of the price of the best aids (I would rate a 10+), I received these yesterday and have been wearing them all day. They may not have all of the features of the expensive brand, but at just $549, they work great (I would rate them a 9 1/2). Highly recommended since I have moderate to severe hearing loss, but can hear clearly again with the otofonix helix aids."
105,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Not true hearing aids...,"Compared to most of the budget earbud-type hearing amplifiers I've tried - these work great. But these are still just hearing amplifiers. I'm not actually sure why they are calling them hearing aids, because hearing aids require custom fitting and fine tuning of frequencies to match your specific hearing loss.These have 4 different preset modes, and 10 volume levels. That's not much different from what your typical hearing amplifier offers. But I will say that the amplification and audio quality is a lot cleaner and less distorted than the cheap amplifiers I've tried in the past.  But these have a lot of noise feedback issues for me. I'll be just sitting and watching tv and suddenly have to endure loud squealing. I also find that if I touch the amplifiers or scratch my ears it can trigger loud feedback noises.Overall - they're good amplifiers, but not sure they are really that much better than other less costly amplifiers. These offer excellent sound quality, but still have occasional feedback issues like my other amplifiers."
105,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Good not great,I was hoping they would be better about the feedback but it’s still pretty bad.
105,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent Value, Game Changer","Love these, including an old pair from a few years ago, and got these new rechargeable. Also got a pair for a friend who could not afford regular hearing aids. Although he has severe hearing loss, these are rated for low to medium hearing loss but have greatly changed his quality of life. I don’t need to ask people to repeat, and like that I don't need multiple trips to an audiologist for adjustments, these can be adjusted easily. Customer service is amazing. They sent me not one, but 2 sets of sound tubes when I contacted them that size 3 was missing in package. Excellent products and excellent company.  Note: They might be a little itchy the first 15-20 minutes in your ear. They were never itchy after that for me after my ears were accustomed to the silicone."
105,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not as advertised,The #1 quiet at home setting results in sounds that are too ‘bright’ and slightly distorted. My $60 Britzgos sound better.The #2 noise reduction setting has a slight effect and removes the distortion present with the #1 setting; but the piddling improvement isn’t worth the $700+ I paid for these devices so I returned them.I am beginning to see why high end hearing aids cost thousands.

105,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,They work great and are easy to setup.,"Bought these for my dad.  They were easy to setup, and he’s really happy with the fit and all of the details he can hear now."
105,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Item was not useful for me,Had to return this item & seek other sources to meet my needs.
105,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best hearing aid, by far, of the 4 I have tried so far","Pros:Super comfortable to wearEasiest controls of all the models I have triedBarely noticeableNo feedbackCons:Need to be cleaned of wax regularlyCan't be used as earbuds for musicI bought 4 hearing aids recently. These were the most expensive, by far. But these are also my favorite. I don't even consider any of the others anymore. All my other models are more like Apple airpods. Those fit tighter in my ear and create an airtight seal that aggravates my ears enough that the pressure causes pain. To be fair I suffer from a nearly collapsed eustachian tube on my left ear. I can rarely pop that ear, so it is very sensitive to air pressure changes and those airpod like hearing aids just makes things worse. These hearing aids come with a bunch of different in ear adapters that allow a variable amount of air and sound into your ear. They have one that blocks everything and multiple levels of unblocked all the way down to almost no blockage. I love that I can pick and choose how much of a seal I want for each ear individually, since my hearing is better in my right ear and that ear also deals with pressure differences better.All of my other hearing aids have the weirdest ways to control them. Most have a single touch pad that with no physical feedback to whether you are increasing or decreasing the amplification. You have to move your finger in the correct pattern and then listen for a tone to confirm you did it correctly. I am practically tone deaf so that method of adjustment is absurd. These Otofonix controls have physical buttons for increasing and decreasing the amplification and they have a double chirp to tell you when you have hit the maximum or minimum amplification. That is perfect.There are four different modes to choose from, Conversation, Restaurant, TV and Outdoors. I have trouble remembering how many beeps each one is. But it's easy enough to cycle through the options and find the one that works best in any situation. Generally, I leave them on Conversation mode.The main downside is that this type of hearing aid sits deeper in your ear than others. So, they will end up with wax on them. Luckily Otofonix thought of everything, they included tiny tools to help you clean the wax off them.I have been wearing these for a couple of months now and only people with the same design of hearing aids notice. I'm not sure my wife even noticed until I told her. They are super small and stay pretty hidden.These are so comfortable I have no problem wearing them all day long.These can't be used as ear buds for music. Not a deal breaker, but other cheaper models that aren't nearly as comfortable and don't work nearly as well have that feature."
105,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Got this for Dad. He has right ear major hearing loss. He says it's better than his old $1800 set.,"I got these for my Father who has major hearing loss on his right ear and has been purchasing amplifiers since that event happened almost 15 years ago.He's got another brand of those recommended by the Doctor and as they break he had been replacing them with similar models and this is the 4th set he's had in 15 years, and even then the first set he purchased were $950 which was a lot more money than what it is now.I asked him to describe what would be the feature he liked the most before he described the rest of them and he said that these were a lot more directional way than his previous set, which helped a lot to position the direction of there the sounds were coming from his right ear, he said that while the previous would amplify based on direction, these felt significantly much more fine tuned to do that in a way that he didn't feel he had to switch to his other ear to position sounds or do several passes with the right ear (and the amplifier, of course) to position, he said it was so much different that he felt confused after 15 years of being unable to position, but that once he got accustomed to it is was much, much better than his previous set.He says amplification in both volume and clarity is excellent, no distortion or volume level fluctuations, also he says the volume steps are finer and he can match his nominal hearing levels of his left ear much better than his previous set.- The fact that these are USB rechargeable means they can be charged ANYWHERE. Car, Hotel Room, Friend's house without having to carry either a proprietary charging block or batteries. Yes, you still need the dock, but before you needed the dock and the charging station.- Comfort level/weight is great, ""lighter than the old ones, yet feel secure"".Overall this felt like an upgrade for him for less money, more convenient and technologically advanced.While i can't offer medical advice , according to my Dad's experience these compete with the brands the Doctors and while he hasn't purchased those $3000+ nowadays, he sure feels these are a huge upgrade from his last $1800 ones he purchased 4 years ago and had just broken from regular use."
105,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Sound Amplifier Works Well for Price,"These are not the hearing aids that my 93-year-old mother was used to wearing. Rather, they are more of sound amplifiers. They have preset options. However, they seem to work well for her during the day when she is watching TV."
105,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Affordable professional quality option vs the ones that cost thousands...,"THE GOOD:---------------* Not the cheapest on the market, but a great alternative to the ones your doctors will recommend that will cost in the thousands.* Otofonix is a reputable brand located in Texas, USA with an online presence for over a decade now. So in terms of tech support and customer service, you can rest assure this is not a fly by night overseas company.* The Helix is rechargeable, and has four listening programs and ten volume levels.* It is as unobtrusive as hearing aids can be.* It is lightweight as well, so it's easy on the ears.* Charging base is a nice looking half-dome unit that can sit on your nightstand.THE BAD:------------* Nothing so far. My dad has been using it, and has no complaints. He's not tech savvy, but he doesn't have to be once I set everything up for him. So far, this is 5-Stars! Will update as he gets more mileage on them and gives me more feedback."
105,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Hearing aids,"Great quality sound, works very nicely very comfortable to have on a lil on the expensive side but are the best ones i have had so far"
105,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very happy with my Helix Hearing Aids,Mom tried them today and she said these were some of the best hearing aids she has every used. She is even able to hear in her ear that normally can't hear even with a hearing aid in. Very impressed!
105,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works amazing forget they are in,Have the lower level ones from them. An liked. Bought these an OMG massive diff. I can hear. GREAT!! after wk or so left decided not to charge. Went on website filled out forms (around 2am)  got up an had email with rma 2nd day Air. Today is 2nd day so hoping get back maybe by Saturday.
94,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Won't last a year. Not durable with occasional use.,"This Personal Sound Amplifier is a reasonably useful device when it is new. (Keep in mind that all similar products claim to remove background noise to hear more clearly. NONE OF THEM DO THAT. This product is no better in that regard.) I did find it useful as a hearing supplement in many situations. I also found it useful as a Bluetooth communications device when connected to my phone.On the downside, the batteries lose the ability to fully recharge after several months. And yes, I'm a technical person and was very careful with their care and maintenance. Once the first battery quit working, it was not possible to tell if the batteries or the charger was defective. In less than 1 year of occasional use, the main unit itself fell apart while I was driving. I found the pieces on the seat, but the unit never worked again. I will not be buying a replacement from Sound World Solutions."
94,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,it performed better than the much more expensive,"So far, this has been a total success!  From the moment it was first used, it performed better than the much more expensive, in the ear hearing aid.  The normal conversational hearing and phone interaction has been superior.  The favorable phone performance has been both with cellular phone via the bluetooth pairing, and with standard desk phones.  Playing the pure sound of music from the bluetooth connection makes enjoying songs and recorded voice much more enjoyable.  Another advantage is with bluetooth pairing during a Skype connection; better than a headphone connection,  and much better than listening to the phone, computer, or tablet speakersThe only reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars is the size of the device.  Although it fits well and is easily adjustable,  the appearance surprises people when told it is a ""hearing device"".  To me it looks much better than most bluetooth devices.Thanks for this product!"
94,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"not invisible , but good !","I havce tried a nbumber of over the counter aids to reduce the WHAT'S in my house . This is thewinner . I have not bothered to use the bluetooth link bcause it comes with three audio profilesbuilt in and aconvenient volume button on the earpiece . It is big and ugly , but so am I at 94so I just want function , and it delivers . If your friends know you can't hear why pretend ?It has good audio tone and volume and battery last all day . Clever design too ."
94,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Works Well For Me,"It would be hard to give any hearing amplifier 5 stars.  There is still work to be done filtering out unwanted background noise.  But with a little practice this absolutely improved my ability to hear conversations in restaurants.  If I look directly at someone when they talk I can hear them well and the background noise is filtered out by my brain, I had almost quit going out for dinner.  Using a cell phone one can take a hearing test and modify the ""single conversation"" amplification curve.  Really made a difference in a fairly quiet environment with only a couple people.  For noisy environments have to use the unmodified ""restaurant"" mode.  And the blue-tooth connection to my phone is a nice added feature. For me the rechargeable batteries is huge.  I find I am not saying ""What!"" near as much which my friends appreciate."
94,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,I can hear again!,"My son convinced me to order these since I was very hesitant with spending over $4,000 on a pair of hearing aids because I am 91 years old. My hearing test showed that I had a 60%% lose in my right ear and 40% in my left, so I purchased a right unit. I have now had them 5 days and can hear again. I am very impressed with the rechargeable battery system since most hearing aids come with batteries you need to replace weekly and this system also seems pretty well made. I can go about 2 days on a rechargeable and then I just swap out the dead battery for the second battery that is charged and on standby. My son mated my cell phone with this unit so now using my Jitterbug phone is even easier to use then before.  Its nice to hear my great grandchildren and not try to read their lips any more. I feel that $350.00 is a lot for such a small thing but compared to hearing aids, its a steal and other than an on/off switch, it does all that I could expect.  I will try music through my cell phone next."
94,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,It helps,"It does help me slightly, to hear conversation outdoors, in noisy kitchens, and in restaurants. But I was hoping for a bit more help. I still have to ask people to repeat themselves, and try as I might, I can't find a compromise setting that enables me to hear crisp speech without also hearing a terrible din of clattering dishes and utensils. Under those circumstances it's such a relief to take the thing off, but then I'm back to square one.---- Update on 2.7.2015 ----The tiny magnets that hold the batteries in place (both on the hearing aid and on the charger) are not very well held in place. I've now had three of them come out -- two on the batteries and one on the charger. The company has replaced one of the batteries, and the charger stand. Knowing what I know now, I would be unlikely to buy this device again. I hardly wear it anymore."
94,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very pleased since using this. My wife is also pleased with it.,"I have been looking at various hearing aids and sound amplifiers for months. This appeared to be a good possibility. When I received it there was a bit of an issue that the seller took care of immediately. I was very impressed that they would  respond so quickly.So far, on my second day with this I am very happy. Exactly what I’m looking for. This does not have that screeching high frequency sound that so many have. With the free iPhone app I am able to tune this to a natural sound. That is the most important thing for me. I am a musician so music is top in my life."
94,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,What is no longer my most common use word,I purchased this about three weeks ago.  The the box put the battery in downloaded the app ran through the set up  and bam I can hear  people without saying what all the time.  I have a boss at work that I can almost never understand before you putting in this device.  Yesterday when I was talking with my wife she looks over at me and says put the damn hearing aid in I'm tired of  repeating myself.  The battery lasts for an entire day from 6 AM until 1030 when I go to bed.  The word I use most is no longer what.  It feels fine in my ear and it also looks like I'm wearing a Bluetooth speaker in fact I've had several people comment that I got a new Bluetooth.  The only thing I wish it had was the capabilities of being a Bluetooth speaker or I could make phone calls from that as well as receive them.
94,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great customer service!,"I ordered the Sound World Solutions amplifier CS50 off of Amazon from JM Sourcing.  I purchased it for my 90-year old mother, who had struggled with inserting replacement batteries in her smaller hearing aids.  This unit worked much better, and the rechargeable batteries are great!  After having the amplifier for several months, she somehow lost the small rubber tip that inserts in the ear.  I contacted JM Sourcing and Jacob was very accommodating by mailing me a few replacements.  I would highly recommend this sound amplifier, and also highly recommend JM Sourcing.  The personal customer service is appreciated!Daryl S."
94,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,works for me,"I bought a replacement silicone tip (inexpensive part that goes in the ear) separately from the manufacturer, so with a new tip it isn't really creepy to have a used hearing aid. This purchase let me find out if this model will work for me without having to spend a lot.  Item was clean and new looking, and sent promptly. Thanks vendor!"
94,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,It worked with one crucial defect,"My wife has been nagging me to get a hearing aid for years - but as an engineer, I am pretty tough to convince without proof it will work. The cost of ""real"" hearing aids seems outrageous given the lack of proven results; but I had to admit that I increasingly was having trouble hearing sound from TV shows and at gatherings (and of course pretty much anything from my wife). So with a little research I determined that maybe the hearing amplifier would do what I needed at an almost reasonable price.The unit, as you can see from the pictures, is by no means invisible - it basically looks like you are always connected to your iPhone - but that is becoming the new normal. With the iPhone app available on their web site I was able to adjust it to match my specific hearing loss (like every other 74 year old - mostly high frequencies). And I wore it almost full time for two weeks with pretty good results. I found it somewhat uncomfortable - but tolerable; and each battery (they give you two) lasted about 10 hours, so I didn't have to worry about running out of power all the time.But here is the crucial defect: last night when I removed the amplifier from my ear the plastic tip stayed behind - just far enough behind that I could not get it out. Nor could my wife when I asked her help when she woke up this morning. It wasn't hard for the ER doc to get it - but this is definitely not something I would like to repeat every two weeks.So were it not for this incident I would have continued trying it a little longer, and then maybe opted for a unit with the same capabilities but a little less obvious and with a little better fit for the ear. But with the incident, I have made a safe and good-fitting ear piece a very high priority.If and when I find one that works as well as the CS50 I will let you know."
94,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent product but could use a few tweaks,"My hearing aid broke and I demoed a $7000 set. Really didn’t feel like forking out that much money when hearing aids are about to become OTC. I bought this is a holdover until that happens. This is an interesting product. I would call it a hybrid earbuds/sound amplifier.I’m not that crazy about the quality of the air buds for music but the hearing aid side is really pretty doggone good. It’s better than the last hearing aid I had and it was the top-of-the-line product. This doesn’t squeal, you can change the polarity of the microphone for your environment easily. The only thing I’m not crazy about is the size of the earpiece. It’s huge. And it’s black. You can see it a mile away. But I guess that’s just vanity so, if you can get over that like I am this is a great product."
94,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Batteries die prematurely,"First writeup (gave 2 stars)  I purchased right-ear (only) in Feb 2018.  Came with two batteries.  Battery life-between-recharges was OK, though well short of a full day.  But after six months, both would not recharge.  I contacted Sound World, and they mailed me two new batteries at no charge.  Great, eh?  But those lasted about six months as well.  My bad thereafter, I got frustrated and did not follow up.  But I cannot recommend due to these batteries, which is a shame because the unit helped me.UPDATE 8/1/2020.  I emailed Sound World and they immediately sent me two new batteries, no charge, arrived in 48 hours!  Yes, this is a SECOND pair of replacement batteries for free!  The email said they have changed the battery design and hope these will last longer.  Finger crossed for that, but I added two stars for their exemplary customer service.  Wow.  And the device certainly works - it helps me."
94,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Pretty decent, but beware","Does a fair job amplifying. The built-in hearing test (in the app) makes for perfect custom adjustments. I have pretty poor hearing, and maybe because of the amplification needed, I get a decent amount of squealing/feedback. I will say that after trying a ""real"" hearing aid even briefly, the sound quality and comfort appeared to be much better, but that is also a much more expensive device.Biggest concern: after wearing this for a couple hours (and the time seems to be less and less over time), the silicone tips soften up and lose their ""grip"" on the earpiece. More than a couple times I have removed the earpiece and then had to get tweezers to fish the silicone tip out of my ear canal."
94,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound & electronics are great, but falls apart","Apparently the glues they use either aren't well applied or are bad. One set arrived in pieces out of the box, another set fell apart after a month. Luckily my wife is handy and can masterfully glue anything back together. It now is robustly put together and sounds great. The electronics seem to be quality. The battery died after three or so months, but that's a lot better than ""real"" hearing aids that need batteries to be replaced every week. These are for my 85 yo mom who really needs a hearing boost, but who hates all things gadget/electronics. It was a big fight to get her to try these. It took some time & repeated instruction, but she actually took to these and is fine with using them routinely. The TV is no longer blaring, which the neighbor is thrilled about! Fix the build/glue issues and it would be a 5 star product."
94,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Works well but not comfortable enough for full time use,"I would recommend this if you have hearing loss in one ear and don't want to wear something full time. It works well and the rechargeable batteries are convenient. The bluetooth feature wasn't interesting to me. Who want to listen to phone calls or music in their bad ear? Although it came in handy when, for example, I'd be out shopping and I DEFINITELY hear my text chime when I needed to.It's like wearing your phone earbuds all day. Not something I can do comfortably. It's fine for a few hours but I'd need to take it out. Wasn't comfortable for me to wear constantly. But if you just need something for working hours or certain situations it's fine. Otherwise, you should look into a hearing aid. I wasn't sure my insurance would cover one so I got this but they ended up being fine so I ended up returning this. It was definitely worth comparing, though, so I'm happy I tried it."
94,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Very Impressive,"This product is very nearly perfect for me. Because I no longer hear the higher frequencies well, speech and sounds are quite muffled. This lack of clarity means it is very hard to understand people speaking, specially in noisy situations. The CS50 has a very nice App for your phone which simply tests your hearing, and adjusts the CS50 to compensate. I have found it to be a great help, and I am now using it every day. It is a pleasure to be able to understand dialogue on the TV easily again. In social situations I can now understand people well. Because you can link it to your phone I even find I can get the Google maps navigation through the earpiece, direct from the phone. I would give it 5 stars, but the only downside I have found is slight peeps of feedback in some instances, if you are moving in confined spaces. That is only a slight irritation though, and I can certainly live with that, given the other benefits."
94,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love being able to hear dialogue on TV and at the movies,"I have a 30% hearing loss, and while I can usually hear well enough in one-on-one conversations (I sometimes have to ask the other person to speak up), I have an awful time understanding people in groups, and also understanding dialogue when watching TV or at the movies. I do use closed captioning, but that's annoying since I have to be watching the screen every second and while reading the dialogue, I'm not really watching the action. Since I got my first set of Sound World Solutions CS50+ hearing devices, that is no longer a problem.These devices are adjustable using buttons on the devices themselves, but if you have a smartphone and download the CS Customizer app you can really fine-tune them to work in different situations.All of us suffering from hearing loss know that medical hearing aids are very expensive, and are not covered by insurance. Since I'm just ""slightly"" hard of hearing, I could not justify spending thousands of dollars for hearing aids. I started to research the over-the-counter hearing devices and finally found the Sound World Solution devices. I'm so happy I did, and I would highly recommend them to anyone who needs to hear better."
94,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,better than my pair of $2400 hearing aids,"Works as promised. I have been wearing a pair of Costco hearing aids for 2 years. I can hear better with this CS50. The bluetooth streaming is so much better than my hearing aids. A good plus is I can adjust the profile myself with the iphone app, instead going to the audiologist, who may or may not do a good job. Love it.Thinking of buying another one for the other ear, but it is not clear to me how two CS50's connect to a smartphone. The user guide doesn't say anything about this.The changes I like to see are: 1) a way to switch it off without taking the battery off; 2) a tonal indication that the volume is at the mid level.I also wish it had anti-noise when doing bluetooth streaming.Updated 6/2/2014: When used as a bluetooth headset in phone conversation, the other side often complains the sound quality. I guess it is the problem of the microphone. I have downgraded it to 4 stars."
94,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good solution…,"We purchased these for our mother as she was getting very frustrated with the $4,000 ones from her Audiologist. Seemed like whatever they tried to do did not help her hearing and she was so frustrated.Faced with another significant outlay of $ we decided to see if these would work for her.  Mom placed them in her ears and then we had her complete the app based hearing test. Once that was done, we started speaking in our normal tone and she just started to smile.  She could hear us clearly for the first time in months.Because Mom’s hearing loss was more a need to amplify instead of compensating for a more severe hearing defect, these aids seem to be doing the job for us.So nice that we can control them with the simple iPhone app. They cost less than the annual maintenance fee on the $4,000 ones. So it’s a win-win for us."
94,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Works well, and affordable","I found this because it was a top hearing aid for the money rated by Wirecutter and it's great. There is nothing that is going to replace the way my hearing used to be, but this unit is easy to use, adapts to different areas, is easy to adjust the volume, and has Bluetooth. There is a bit of feedback but I have noticed that once the unit is settled, it does not return. It's made it so that I do not miss conversation when there are multiple voices, and I can hear low tones. I am very happy with the unit."
94,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,Sound is good but Charge Design and Case needs Improvement,"The sound quality is good, but the clunky configuration on placing the batteries on the charger that doesn't lay flat anywhere takes up unnecessary space.  The design should be a hard case where the batteries could be safely enclosed while charging.  Additionally, support is eastern time and don't respond to voice mails or tickets created on their own site."
94,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Really works well, now I don't need an expensive medical hearing aid","I've had this a few months now, and it's wonderful.  I hate having anything in my ears, so it took me a while to get used to the amplifier, but I'm used to it now and it's great.  I got this one because of the Johns Hopkins medical study that said this amplifier worked as well as medical hearing aids for most people.  I highly recommend doing the tuning with the app when you first get it; it helps.The only problem, I can hear my kids whining.  And the fan is SO loud.  ;)"
94,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,New product,Just received so far so good works as a hearing aid and Bluetooth nice app to download I'm a nurse by professional works great will have to see battery life
94,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Sound and Incredible Battery Life!,"I have had this Sound Amplifier for about a week now, and I am extremely impressed with both the sound quality and the battery life.  I am profoundly deaf in one ear and have a mild loss in the other.  The sound amplification is powerful enough to give me much better clarity as to what is being said.  As far as the battery life is concerned, it lasted 14 hours yesterday, and still had some battery life left when I turned it off for the day.  Excellent product."
94,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,A handy tool for making working under current circumstances more bearable.,"Purchased for hubby to use in his office.  Due to people wearing masks and speaking on the other side of a plexiglass barrier, he needed a tool so he was not asking people to repeat themselves.  He reports that these work well especially with softer speaking clients.  He does warn that certain sounds, like a printer that is right by his side, can be very loud if one doesn’t adjust the volume before using that type of machinery.Glad we took the chance and we are well satisfied!"
94,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Could be better,Would like to be able to turn off the blue tooth feature when my phone rings. What I do to get a clear call is to remove the unit from my ear and disconnect the battery. It is not easy to use in a noisy restaurant as it picks up too much noise. Have found that often when I use the program to change settings it defaults to 'music volume' which prevents me from making the settings changes. Another problem is when driving it amplifies 'road/tire noise'. Bottom line I find myself not using it as often as I would like.
94,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works like a charm!,"These adjustable hearing aids do everything the $2,000 hearing aids do.  You can select treble, midrange and bass decibel and loudness levels. It’s also directional: setting for restaurant, entertainment and everyday."
94,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,feed back and background isssues,"I knew the unit would not be the same quality of the expensive aids that are out there but for $350 I expected something I could use.  I thought I would acclimate to the amplified peripheral sounds and gave it a couple of months.  It didn't happen.  I then realized that the outside noise was intefering with the ability to hear voices in normal situations.  Even a small fan across the room would be distracting. The feedback was another thing I thought I would get used to it also but changed my mind when friends would tell me they could hear it.  I kept my ears and earpiece clean, so that was not a factor.I've had no issues with magnets or charge time. However, one battery is not accepting a charge anymore.  It's been ninety days since my purchase.  I have cleaned  contacts on the battery  and the charging unit.  I do not think it's worth $30 to replace the battery.  Disappointed with the product to say the least."
94,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,better than hearing aids,bought this for my dad. he has 0% hearing in 1 ear and really bad hearing in the other. he has done hearing tests and tried on several hearing aids that cost > 1000 which he refused due to getting background sounds.this device works for him better than anything else. setup was super easy and < 15 minutes. first thing he hear was his infant grand daughters hiccups. this made a huge differnece in him.
94,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,This device is amazing and has changed my enjoyment of life,"This device is amazing and has changed my enjoyment of life.  Yes, I look like ""that guy"" wearing his Bluetooth headset and checking his phone--when I'm really using my device and following the conversation, using my iPhone to adjust the sound.  NOBODY has suspected any kind of sound device, they all think it's my bb earpiece."
94,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Clarity of sounds,Does a great job of amplifying just eough with different settings to make words easier to understand.
94,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Broke After 9 Months,"Don't do business with this company. The back of the device fell off after 9 months. Sound World never responded to e-mail nor phone requests for assistance.Also, the batteries lasted for a full day at first. Within a month they were down to 8 hours. After 3 months, I had to replace them. And had to replace those 3 months later."
94,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Product for the Money,If your looking for a hearing aide that will also connect to you phone this is a great product..
94,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Three Stars,Could use few improvments  but ok over all ok
94,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,Picked up too much background noise,"Real simple, it seemed to pick up everything except people talking, I tried every setting. If you had four people having dinner with NO background noise ( TV, Radio) it was great, any backgroung and it was worthless. I returned it."
94,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,A true hearing aid,"For help in movie theaters, restaurants and some home theater sound problems, this devices is great. No learning curve to setup or use. The recharge aspect is a bonus especially with the 2 batteries. Very comfortable and most people think it is just a Bluetooth device for my phone."
94,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,OK,OK but insufficient amplification.
94,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,The best,Out of all the hearing aids I bought this is the best I've ever had
94,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,great,"For the price, I am very happy.  Customizing frequencies through the phone is a great plus.  But what really struck me is the great design for the battery - battery connections; way better than the button batteries."
94,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,It Fell Apart ON DAY ONE,"It fell apart as soon as I tried pressing the environment button a few times to test out the different modes. The entire side covering fell off, exposing the little green electronics board inside. REALLY BAD BUILD QUALITY or bad QA or both. Highly disappointed with this product. I know it's not very expensive, but I figured it should last at least a couple of years before starting to fall apart..."
94,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,The product from sound world solutions is easy to use and program using my Android smart phone,Liberty delivered CS50 in 2 days without shipping charge. The product from sound world solutions is easy to use and program using my Android smart phone. It helps my hearing with more clarity.
94,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Life saver!,"Easy to set up and use, amazing sound quality and will change the life of my mother in law!!"
94,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Poor construction,"the hearing aid works very well.  The body, however is falling apart after 2.5 months.  The back is popped open and the adjustment tab on top fell off.  the unit still functions but soon will be in pieces.  I do not care to have to scotch tape it together and cannot find the adjustment tab.  This is a real shame."
94,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,price for new model was reduced $50.00,I have now used it for almost 2 weeks and it has been flawless.  Thanks for new model!!Thanks for a better product!David from Southern Illinois
94,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Zero Stars - Item broke in less than 60 days,"Parts broke off and battery life deteriorated in less than 60 days.  JM Sourcing ny inc, the company that sold my ""Sound World Solutions""  Hearing device, has no contact information available to reach them about returning the faulty product they sold me.  Be careful about buying products off Amazon with Companies that have no contact information!!!"
94,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,not as expected,phone blue tooth is sooo intermittent
94,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Well worth the price,Works better than my expensive hearing aids in some situations. I pared it with my iPhone for best results. Good to have as alternative to hearing aids. Highly recommended.
94,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,No Bluetooth,"Free app which looks very helpful is not available to computer unless you have Bluetooth connection. This is ridiculous! The unit does magnify sound ok, but I could not tell any difference between Every Day Setting and Restaurant Setting. Seems like there should be a big difference. Warranty & return policy says ""45-Day Money Back Guarantee"" on their website but their User Guide seems to imply they'll only take it back if defective. Fortunately the Amazon guarantee overrides this."
94,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,Poor Quality product,Cheaply Made product- breaks apart easily.
94,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very good product,My doctor recommended these. They help me hear the tv and understand what people are saying.
94,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth it,This prouduct was great until the dog ate it 😂 much better than paying thousands for hearing aids.
94,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,"In restaurants, makes things worse",Poor performance in restaurants. Amplifies noise more than the voices in front of you.
94,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointment,"I purchased this unit just over a year ago.  Have used it only a few tmes.Now the battery lasts only 3 to 4 hours, instead of 18 hours as advertised.I requested a replacement, but was denied.  Once a year has passed,customer is out of luck.  I expect better service for $350 price."
94,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,battery last no more than 6 months,short battery life and low volume sound
94,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Just what I needed.,"I have some hearing loss that is especially troublesome in large meetings.  This definitely did the trick for me at a far more reasonable cost that a full blown and much more expensive hearing aid, just what I needed."
94,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Defective,"The ear piece started making crackling noise, .i sent it back, after a week received anew one with the same defect."
94,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,where is my refund,Returned for being defective. Refunded but never received payment for over 2 months.
94,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Worked very well, the whole family is very happy","Well worth the money, my mom can finally hear what's being said to her."
94,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Easily breaks,"Good electronic sound quality and function with iPhone, but poorly made plastic body. Comes apart and breaks with the slightest impact. Have gone through two for the right ear. The left ear body is still intact but I do not use it as much. I am a surgeon and work with delicate equipment all the time."
94,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Does the job,"It did basically do what I needed it to do which was to hear my grandchildren better. I do like that it is rechargeable and that you can control it from your smartphone. My biggest issue is that the ""box"" part is too big for my smallish ear shell and it hurts to wear it since it presses against the shell. It actually made a callus where it pressed."
94,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Hearing Aid Alternative works for me.,"The app has 3 different pages for settings, but the manual doesn’t describe how these settings interact, or if they interact at all.I have used a Bose Hearphones for several years, but Bose has discontinued making them.  The Sound World device's sound quality isn’t as good as the Bose unit, but adequate for my needs.There are two changes I'd like to see made to the Sound World Hearing Aid alternative:1. Allow the user to turn off the microphone while listening to programs via Bluetooth.2. Allow the user to turn off the voice announcing ""Connected "" and ""Connection lost"".  I leave my phone in a room, and it is annoying having these announcements playing repeatedly as I move around the house."
94,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,I can hear better,"I bought one to see if I liked it.  I did, because the ability to hear computer videos through blue tooth connection was my main interest.  That worked great, although I did have some trouble pairing it on all my computers and tablets.  I bought a second for the other ear.  The drawback is that only one of these can be paired at a time so listening in both ears simultaneously is not possible."
94,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works well,"I am a teacher and just use this in the classroom. I had bought a $1000 hearing aid and it just stopped working. It would be cool to buy a real hearing aid that is fitted but this one is fine except you need to take precautions. The back fell off and I luckily found it and I keep tape on it. The battery fell off, so I bought a leash and put the band around the battery to secure it, and clipedp the line  onto my collar. It does not fit well. I had to buy those little wrap around things, which work ok, and still, for the price, I am happy with it. The best part is I don't have to find batteries for it. There is a self charger and they give you two batteries. I am happy with this product. It does improve hearing!"
94,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,I can hear!  What a gift!,"I am in my mid 70's.  Hearing has been declining for several years.  In January 2020 I purchased a CS50+ for my left ear.  Improvement was immediate and dramatic.  Recently I purchased an amplifier for the right side.  Now my hearing is more balanced and better overall.  The sound quality is outstanding and the devices could not be more comfortable.  Occasionally I find myself checking to be sure they are still in place, since I can not feel them at all.  Not surprisingly, the only person who appreciates them as much or even more than I do is my wife!"
94,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Second set,Purchased for 89 y.o. with dementia. Using as a hearing aid to cut costs. These are durable. The most challenging part is tuning it with the phone app. But was easy for my mom to use. It works for her when in public settings such as a restaurant. Helps amplify most all sound.
94,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Superior sound, rechargeable batteries work perfectly","This hearing aid has been a life changer ! The quality is amazing and it is easy to use. The ability to easily recharge the batteries is a huge plus too. I recommended to a friend and she loves them too. This product is much better than ones you pay over $1,000 for."
94,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Somewhat helpful,"After learning the ropes of how to adjust the settings in my CS50 wireless, I find that I am actually using it less and less. Where I need help in hearing is in restaurants at large tables. However in precisely that situation, it is impossible to hear the slight beeping of the CS50; the background sound way overpowers the hearing device. In pairing it with the iPhone I find also that it uses up battery power very quickly--in a couple of hours. Perhaps its time for me to graduate to a real hearing aid after all. The Customer service is excellent and quite helpful."
94,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,No better for streaming than earbuds.,I cannot rate it on its usefulness as a hearing aid.  I wanted something with clarity as a streaming receiver to fall asleep with while my regular hearing aids were charging.  I found the aid comfortable and the sound streamed well.  However it was no better than some earbuds I was using before.
94,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,falls apart,"I like the product but have two of them now and both  have literally fallen apart. Only my latest one is still working. The one before that cuts out because the wire is not secure. I got smart on the last one  and taped it together when it first started falling apart.  The cover on the ear piece falls off, the wires disconnect, and the cover on the battery falls off as well. Another of the batteries has just quit working.  Unfortunately, I didn't turn in the problem with the first one and now it is out of warranty.  If they would stay working and stay in one piece I would certainly like it much better. I would like help with the last one that I purchased as it is ugly to have it all taped up."
94,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not great for me.,"What I really wanted this for was movie theater, but not great for that.  I do like it for blue tooth for phone directions when I drive."
94,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product for my aging Mom,"My mother is 90 and will not wear her hearing aid because they fall out.  This product is a fraction of the cost, and she likes it better.  In fact, she even wears it -- so, a big win."
94,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,‘I can hear you now!’,"Received the PSAP 2 weeks ago, changed my life completely, especially in church, restaurants, visiting with others. What a difference, connected to my iphone, app is free, works as advertised, sound is probably better.  Highly recommend this to anybody with partial hearing loss."
94,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,"It's a good concept, but they have not mastered it yet","It's a good concept, but they have not mastered it yet. I'll give them another try in the next year or so. I hope they get it right. A very tinny sound, but that wasn't the reason I returned it. Just didn't get the job done. I probably could have lived with the tinny sound. Depending on your hearing problem it might be worth a try. It may work well for you."
94,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best sound amplifier I've tried,"If you want to hear, buy the Sound World amplifier; if you want to disguise the fact that you are wearing an amplifier, don't buy it.  The device is comfortable, efficient, and admirably adjustable."
94,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Unit works great, love the longer life batteries","Unit works great, love the longer life batteries.  However, app to personalize the unit sound does not download!  Wrote company, still waiting to get this problem resolved."
94,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Don't Buy, It's Junk.",Had it for three months.  I hate it.  Feedback noise is so loud every one in the room hears it.  It comes on if you turn your head or lift you arm or come close to any object.  I wish I coud return it but I guess I waited too long.  I am evaluating everything Amazon.  It seems like the only sell crap.
94,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Easy Configuration,Easy to configure and use.  Provided spare battery avoid non-use time while waiting for battery recharge.  Multiple ear piece tips provide for better fit and comfort.
94,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good Product, Not Exactly for Me","I'm going to return, only because it doesn't make enough difference for me.  It is made very well, and does exactly as advertised."
94,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,CS50,"I love it! Just hated my hearing aids, uncomfortable & almost useless but with CS50 & left hearing aid in place I can actually hear conversation with adjustment of CS50. A real bargain but I need extra batteries"
94,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Meh  Get a real hearing aid,"sound quality...meh.  Can't be paired, so streaming music through device is a no-go.  After a week, went and got real hearing aids....like night and day.  Save your money and get what you need, skip this."
94,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,You can answer the phone by touching a button. The price is right. Good unit for the price.,Lots of advantages over more expensive models.
94,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,My Girl is happy now...,"I bought one 11 months ago, to hear TV dialogue and my wife's comments, and save big $$$$.Well, it's all worked out as planned.  I put this on for TV and I can hear most all the dialog.  I fiddled for months with fine-tuning the frequency amplifications, but found that for me there was a broad ""ok"" area, so no need to obsess.  I'll turn the volume up or down a few steps and life is good.We watch TV 2-3 hours a night and the battery lasts over a week.  Just takes a minute to swap a new battery with the charger.Overall this has been a life-saver for me.  12 stars!!"
94,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great instrument and a good value.,I really like this hearing amplifier. It provides as much sound enhancement as I need and the quality of the sound is good.
94,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works as advertised,"I have been using this hearing aid for several years. My experience is that the inexpensive ones work just as well as the expensive ones, rechargeable is better than batteries and Bluetooth is a nice feature. I just bought another one because the recharge dock failed after several. The Sound World product does everything I need it to do."
94,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,... about every thing on Amazon and this is the best. I use this in my best ear and ...,I have tried about every thing on Amazon and this is the best.  I use this in my  best ear and a easyuslife in product in my  ear that is bad for ear for balance.  This unit not just a hearing unit the Bluetooth is excellent.  I listen to podcasts that I had given up on.  The entertainment mode on bluetooth is excellent...I am watching shows that I had giving up on.  Worth the price which is very low.
94,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Next best thing to a hearing aid.,Large button for volume. Easy to use and charge for an elderly parent.  Next best thing to a hearing aid.
94,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very satisfied with new CS50,"I am very satisfied with the new CS50. It gives you unique insights into hearing enhancements. I hear sounds I haven't heard for years. The volume is easy to adjust. Battery recharge is quick. I used the website to adjust the pattern of sounds. It is most helpful in gatherings with speakers I would otherwise not be able to hear. I use the supplied small carrying case to switch batteries or remove the unit when not in use publically.  Even if I buy a $5,000-$7,000 hearing aid later, this was a very useful purchase.  A positive learning experience."
94,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Yes this helped,"I bought both left and right sound amplifiers. I use the right one the most, especially for phone calls, and it really helps. Occasionally I use both but not often. They are easy to use, pretty comfortable and they do increase the volume of sound, which is helpful."
94,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Not perfect but it is wonderful, life changing.","Very well designed.  They get nearly every detail right.  Now, finally I have a way to hear the presenters in seminars where the acoustics are weak or the presenter does not speak with authority.  I love the interaction with the iPhone app.  The treble does sound a bit tinny but not as bad as other ear pieces.  Do not expect to enjoy music via this piece.  Be sure to get the cs50, not cs10, as the cs50 incorporates bluetooth 4.0 for extended battery savings and also this is the model that works with iPhone app."
94,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Too Soon to Say, but...","I’ll be back to update this in a few weeks, but here’s the first impression: My hearing aids died and I didn’t want to replace them just yet for reasons I won’t go into, but I had to do something. My hearing loss is minimal in my left hear, but kind of poor on the right. With the hearing aids, I still had problems hearing TV dialog and restaurant conversation, though it was better than with nothing. I decided I had little to lose by trying out the Sound World Solutions thingy.If I’d had this in the first place, I doubt I’d have gotten hearing aids. It’s such an improvement over nothing. I put it on out of the box, and it was so sensitive, I could hear the pages turning in the owner’s manual. That was really something. I still can’t get TV dialog as well as I‘d hoped, but it’s better than the hearing aids were for that.That said, it’s still not a hearing aid, and it’s not as good for general hearing (though almost). If I talk with it on, it sounds as though I’m talking to myself from about an inch away. It also has an echo chamber effect, where you feel as though you’re in a cave. And it’s been staticky a couple of times.You have the option of using presets or customizing reception, and as the manual suggested, I tried re-doing the custom settings a few times. That worked pretty well, and all of the little things I complained about above improved. Because of that, I’m sticking with it for a few weeks and will probably use it even if I replace the hearing aids.My own view is that the hearing aid industry is kind of a racket. When you think of the technology in a $500 smart phone, you wonder why hearing aids are three to six times that much. Hearing aid companies advertise heavily , offer *free* hearing tests, and multi-year warranty work. That has to be paid for somehow. On top of that, “You don’t need hearing aids, you just need an a hearing amplifier,” said no hearing aid store, ever.This product will be as good as a hearing aid for a lot of people. So far, it’s good for me, though they could change up or down in a few weeks. I should say I haven’t used the Bluetooth feature or phone answering part yet, but still.UPDATE 6/7/2021: Increasing to five stars. After setting and resetting the customization features, the sound quality is really good, not just for everyday, but for listening to television dialogue. The Bluetooth and phone-answering is good, and so far, the battery life is just fine."
94,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,No Firmware update ability..but it works as advertised.,"At the time of this review (and probably forever) it is not mentioned anywhere as for having ability to update the firmware.  That should be fine as long as there are no bugs and the software has no room for improvement.I see it has ability to stream music with it's a2dp mode, (unlike it's predecessor) but it's not listed anywhere if using 2 of them will allow stereo streaming - in which it might be interesting for some to know if using 2 of them would be a true left/right sound separation that you would get with standard headphones. Doubtful.  I'm thinking dual headset usage and stereo streaming is an insignificant factor for most, myself included, but wanted to add to this review.It's not advertised as being able to pair with a computer, but I tried it anyway.  It was a little tricky to get them to pair, and once paired it still wouldn't communicate further other than simply acknowledging that they were paired.  The laptops I tried it on were both requesting a software update which doesn't appear to be available anywhere.  Perhaps even a firmware update might be needed.  Definitely not a problem for me, just wanted to see what it's capable of doing beyond the description.It's written in the manual that it automatically opens BlueTooth pairing mode for 3 minutes immediately starting from connecting the battery.  That may or may not be true, but what worked for me in getting the laptops to see them was essentially clapping the battery on and back off of the unit at 3 second intervals. After the 3rd attempt it picked it up.Pairing code is the standard ""0000""It works as advertised and the sounds are indeed amplified.  It truly takes some getting accustomed to wearing and if you haven't tried hearing devices before then you may or may not have your expectations set right.  I haven't tried other units of any kind but figured I'd start with this one as it's predecessor ""CS10"" had good reviews and this one is likely the same thing but with an updated BlueTooth chip which allows for the better power consumption and a2dp audio streaming.It amplifies all things - from clicks to clanks to water running to coughing, scratching, rustling...you'll see!or eh hear! Voice does come in amplified as well, but it's not much more amplified than all the other noises.  Wouldn't expect a miracle, but it seems some are claiming it's better than their multi-thousand dollar prescription units.I snipped this from an article:""Directionality is the only way to improve intelligibility in noisy environments,"" said Dr. Stavros Basseas, co-founder and president of Sound World Solutions. ""We are very pleased with how much background noise the algorithms of the CS50 can attenuate. It is dramatically better than even our previous product.""It comes in a small box, easy to return if you don't like it. I'd say go ahead and get it, but don't be afraid to wear it. People will be glad if you are no longer making up things when you mishear them. :)"
94,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Worked well but stopped working in 120 days.,"The item worked well and helped me to hear better. However, I gave it a one-star rating because it stopped working 120 days after I received it. Since the warranty was only for 90 days, I now have a product I can't use and am out the full purchase price."
94,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Thank you Soundworld,"I am older (refuse to admit being elderly) with almost total hearing loss in my left ear due to an injury, mild-moderate in my right ear. So keeping what I have is important to me. I had an expensive aid that crapped out after about 2 years and have looked for an alternative to $1600 every two years. Bought this as a second replacement after another brand began wearing out after 3-4 years. Honestly bought this aid because of the Bluetooth function and rechargeable batteries as well as because of the BAD reviews-figured I’d see for myself. Well I saw and have been blown away. I’ve used this aid everyday, morning to night for 2 weeks and found it easily programmable, comfortable, very well made and totally dependable. I paired it with my phone once and never had to do it again. When I connect the battery it tells me the mode that it is in and verbally confirms connection. I have intentionally gone to the limits of the BT range and gotten verbal notification when connection is lost and when it’s regained. The sound is a little tinny to my ear but very clear and acceptable. Final pro is that when battery level is low I am alerted well before power is lost and have not experienced any reduction of sound volume or quality before changing the battery. The only problem I have had is initial fit because of me, not the product. I have a bony ridge just at the entrance to my ear canal that has always been a problem. The shelf domes with this aid didn’t fit of course. But I found that I could trim the end of the done that connects to the aid and use the small dome, or do the same with a slight trim of the dome itself and also use the medium dome. I love this product and plan to buy it again if it lasts long term. $300 every two to three years is way better than $1600."
94,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Deliberated and pondered,"I knew I was saying, ""what"" too often and pondered the need for a ""real"" hearing aid. I began my research and discovered that hearing aid place want to you make an appointment, show up with your spouse, and participate in a long testing process - covertly designed to convince you that there's hearing loss and that a professional hearing aid will solve your problems.I also discovered that hearing aid prices can range from a thousand dollars to well over $10,000 and that the differences are, for the most part, based in the perception that higher cost means higher quality. This is not the case for these products.I'm of an age where many friends and acquaintances have hearing aids. I polled many and didn't find one who is happy with the purchase. Most tell stories of repeat visits for fitting and tuning - which they pay for after the first few that had been included in the original purchase.I did not want to devote the time to the process - and the sellers (some call themselves DOCTOR) were only interested in the way they do things. I was also peeved by the insistence that my wife attend. I often see this tactic used when a sales person is working to make a sale and fears being put off when the buyer says he/she needs to go home and check with the spouse. They know that once the person leaves the scene the chance for a sale drops a lot.I just could not see myself dropping thousands of dollars for something that would take time to fit and tune and which probably wouldn't meet my needs in the end. I remain put off by the fact that prices vary so much for no recognizable differences.The CS50 is NOT a hearing aid. The FDA won't let it be referred to as such. It is, officially, a Personal Sound Amplification Device (PSAD) - and a very good one at that.  In addition to assisting my hearing (very well) it is also a Bluetooth headset for my iPhone and I can listen to music - wirelessly.To make it all come together, the CS50 also has an app that allows me to customize and fine tune the device - without the need to visit anyone or spend any money.I bought my CS50 from Amazon in spite of the fact that it is sold from a company right here in Illinois. My Amazon Prime afforded my the chance to get it shipped free - and next day for only $7 more.It arrived as promised, well packed, and not even a hint of package damage. It worked right out of the box. After about a week of wear I hardly notice it. However, I do notice it when I'm not wearing it. The battery is rechargeable and lasts for a full day for me - well over 12 hours. It came with 2 batteries and everything I need to wear it comfortably all day.It looks like a standard Bluetooth device. I would certainly recommend anyone worried about hearing to try this amplifier. It has a 30-day no question warranty, which helped close the sale for me - and which I don't think I'll use.I have it in one ear only. Two may be next."
94,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Helps, not magic. Reasonable cost/benefit.","It helps, but it's not magic. I have moderate high-freq sensorineural loss (and tinnitus), so I'm missing what my wife says when she's facing away, losing dialog on TV, etc - classic stuff. With this on, I do noticeably better. The Customizer app is useful for setting up a personal profile. Comfort so far is just ""OK"" - it's secure if I use the small eartip and doesn't hurt, but I definitely know I'm wearing it and after a few hours I'm happy to take it off ... my ear canal gets slightly tender! If I use the medium eartip it doesn't hurt, but it doesn't seat well, and I get a lot more feedback squeal and such.Some cons: More background noise than I expected (particularly annoying in wind or when it amplifies my car's environmental noise, so this is really a living room/restaurant aid); and, sudden noises (dropped keys, etc) are a painful blast. Putting it on/off gets me a brief and mildly annoying feedback squeal, there's no way turn it on/off while on the ear to avoid that. The Customizer app UI is somewhat confusing and it only works when it's actually connected to the unit - you can't see your settings if you've turned off the CS50. There's no way to know how much battery is left (including, no indication in the Android app). Mono, not stereo, of course. The ear tip has come off a couple times, staying stuck in my ear canal, and is easily lose-able (and $15 + $3 shipping to get three replacement eartips!)I'm considering ""real"" hearing aids, but this seemed like a good (and fairly inexpensive) way to learn how much I'm missing. So, I bought one of the used ones here: the unit unit is complete and appears perfectly fine. This was a good way to save $75 :) but it turns out I use it fairly rarely ... if I decide I want this help all day long I'll go and get something from an audiologist."
94,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent value for the money,"The quality of the sound surpassed my expectations.  The app makes it very easy to create a personal hearing profile that for me was superior to the preprogrammed profiles.  However, I did find the built-in Restaurant profile to be superior at helping to block out background noises.  I had to do a second personal profile, as I rushed through the first.  You must listen very carefully, in a space with little or no noise, to hear all the signals that are necessary to create an accurate profile.  The instructions are very clear, but you need to get the app to really get the most out this device.  This seems to be an excellent choice for those of us with mild to moderate hearing loss.  It's not promoted as a hearing aid, but is a very sophisticated sound amplifier.  One caution, turn the volume down before placing it in your ear to avoidfeedback noise, as the transition from open space to your ear can create a sharp whistling noise.I would definitely recommend this to a friend with moderate hearing loss.  I primarily use it for TV.This model does have Blue Tooth.  I have only used it with the Windows App to configure my personal profile.  I assume the Blue Tooth will work with other sound sources, but haven't used it in that fashion."
94,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,He can hear clearly!,"This is the second hearing appliance I purchased for my husband.  The first one was cheaper and kept popping out of his ear. It also made a whistling sound whenever he touched his ear, which was embarrassing when we were in church.  One Sunday we were in a small room and they were live streaming the session.  The instructor had a soft voice and my husband couldn't hear her.  He kept adjusting the sound which made a loud whistling sound.  I don't know who was more embarrassed us or the instructor.He said the older hearing appliance also picked up sounds he didn't want to hear, like high-pitch, sharp notes.  My voice is low and soft pitch so my husband constantly asked me 'What did you say?'  Additionally, I had to purchase the batteries from an online industrial business because the recommended batteries were smaller and didn't last long,The CS50 Wireless Bluetooth Sound Amplifier is a God-send.  We have yet to pare the amplifier with his cell phone because he is so fully satisfied with how well he hears as is.  As soon as my husband clamped the amplifier to his ear he started smiling.  He kept asking me to say something, anything.  The CS50 is smaller, has a better plug to the ear which does not pop out at will.  And, it looks just like a Bluetooth appliance.Great product.  I truly recommend the CS50 to anyone who has trouble distinguishing low pitch, soft sounds."
94,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Really helps me.,"I have 30% hearing loss in one ear and didn't want to pay for a hearing aid. I'm glad I bought this, as it helps me substantially. It does amplify all sounds, such as the rustling of paper, but I got used to that and soon tuned those sounds out. But, yay, I hear my TV, music and -- most importantly -- people talking much better. I like the easy-to-use environment settings (normal life, restaurant, etc) and volume options. It also adjusts for fit in a couple of ways. This is very easy to use. I don't mind the visibility of the device, as so many people are running around with earbuds and the like these days. One thing I learned early with this: at first I didn't know whether to focus on listening to the person/TV/radio/whatever or focus on listening through this device; I soon learned to just ignore the device and listen to the person/TV/radio/whatever like I did before. For the cost as opposed to a hearing aid, this amplifier was a smart purchase for me."
94,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Early review - positive,"I bought this for my mother, who is reluctant about wearing a hearing device but needs one!  I liked that it can be paired using Bluetooth to work with her phone.They're sold separately (L/R), and I wasn't certain if one of her ears was worse than the other (which turns out to be the case), so I had to exchange for the other side.  So do be aware of that.The one in the picture arrived slightly damage, in that the plastic housing around the electronics wouldn't stay snapped in place.  But it was functioning, and she was able to try it out. It seemed to improve what she could hear, so I will try to order a replacement (and addend review after some time using)."
160,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,This hearing aid competes with the muli-thousand dollar hearing aids.,"rather than fullness or thickness for advanced adjustments, I would like to see labels for base and treble adjustments"
160,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,GREAT sound & EASY to optimize,"Pristinely clear, personalized audio makes my hearing as sharp as it was 10 or 15 years ago.WOW! What an amazing difference they make!!"
160,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent hearing enhancement but relatively short battery life,"I have worn prescription hearing aids for a long time.  Now that Over The Counter (OTC) hearing aids are available I wanted to see if they could be as good as my prescription hearing aids and perhaps save some money.The Linner Mars OTC hearing aids remind me more of earbuds than hearing aids.  My first impression was that they were similar to Apple AirPods.  I found that these hearing aids worked well right out of the box.  Installing the app allows for more control of the hearing aids.  I especially liked the app's simple hearing test. Once you complete the test, the hearing aids are more tuned into the sound frequencies that you have the most hearing loss.  It was easy to do and seems to work quite well.As with many hearing aids that use closed silicone domes, it takes time to get used to hearing the sounds of your own body like your voice, walking, chewing, etc.  Since I have worn hearings aids with closed domes for years, I adjusted quickly.  The manual that accompanies the hearing aids suggests that you acclimate yourself to the hearing aides by wearing them for a few hours in the beginning, and build up to longer wearing times.  Being a long term hearing aid wearer, I felt comfortable wearing them as long as the battery lasted.  The battery never gave me the full 8 hours since I stream audiobooks frequently.I found that they stayed in my ears well, even when I was physically active.  They come with various sizes of silicone domes, that you can fit to your comfort.  The hearing aids only occasionally emit a high pitched squeal, as all hearing aids will do when you cover your ear or otherwise for feedback.  In a moderate wind there is only slight wind noise.Pros:- easy to use app to customize a simple audiogram- Small, easy to carry recharging case with built-in battery- Pairs easily with iPhone and iPad to listen to music, audiobooks, YouTube, etc.  I am sure it works equally well with Android devices.- Reasonably comfortable to wear- High quality build and reasonably pricedCons:- The controls for tapping the hearing aids to control volume and answer calls confuses me and I have to rely on the app for volume control and the phone for answering and hanging up.- Switching from one Bluetooth device to another requires you disconnect from one to connect to the other.  It's awkward but doable. Would be nice if they could figure out how seamlessly switch like AirPods and my prescription hearing aids do.- Battery life is not long enough for a full 16 hour day, but at this price you could buy two pair for less than half the price of a set of inexpensive prescription hearing aids.  This won't be a problem if you only link the hearing aids to one device, e.g.,your phone.- No noise cancellation mode- Many prescription hearing aids and some OTC hearing aids are hard for anyone to see so they don't know you're even wearing hearing aids.  The Linner Mars hearings look like earbuds so some people may think you can't hear them or don't want to talk to them, as they think you are listening to music, etc.SummaryI think these hearing aids are a good choice for someone who doesn't need to wear hearing aids all day long.  The charging case is small, and easily fits in a pocket to hold and charge the hearing aids when they are not in"
160,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,Too large,The earpiece kept falling out.
160,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Linner quality is superb,Easy to use & connect! Attractive & functionality is A+. Customer support is excellent! Just wish the batteries would last longer!
160,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect as a backup pair of hearing aids,"My mother-in-law is always misplacing her hearing aids. Sometimes we find them quickly, but other times we don’t find them for days. Without them, she can’t hear a thing. We looked into buying an exact duplicate pair of her primary hearing aids, but they were very expensive, so we settled on these as a suitable backup.They are packaged really nicely and easy for an elderly person to open. The instructions are very clear and simple. There is a wrapper on the case that has a QR code that’s supposed to take you to their website. We couldn’t get that QR code to work, but the one on the box worked. There is an app to download and they work with iPhone or android. They also come with a few different types of tips, so you can figure out which ones are most comfortable for you. The hearing aids look a lot like AirPods or wireless Bluetooth earbuds. They can be used without the app, however there are a lot of additional settings you can adjust with the app as seen in the pics I’ve attached.I really like that the user manual and customer support are built into the app. There are 5 icons across the bottom of the app homepage (which defaults to the control page).  Each hearing aid can be adjusted independently, so if hearing loss is worse in one ear, you can customize them for individualized sound.If the individual using these has never used hearing aids, the last icon is a hearing test that can help adjust the hearing aids to their needs.I also love that these also serve as Bluetooth headphones. There’s no switching back and forth, if a call comes in, it goes straight to the hearing aids, but you can also still hear your surroundings if needed.And one of the best features is how easy it is to get support/help. There’s an icon at the bottom of the homepage or it can be accessed through the profile page. This has saved us when my mother-in-law forgets how to use them (every time she goes to use them).If you are in a similar situation, these things will save you from a lot of frustration and headaches."
160,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,No what we hoped for,"Got these for my wife, as she obviously listened to her music way too loud as a kid 50+ years ago. If she isn't able to see lips moving, there's a good chance you are going to have to repeat yourself.Neither of us has ever even tried hearing aids before, so we weren't sure what to expect. I also realize that many of the hearing aid products available are very expensive (>$1000) so given the  price of these, we're likely in the ""No Frills Car"" vs ""Tesla"" comparison world.With respect to size and appearance, these are more like wireless earphones than what you typically would consider traditional hearing aids. And that is a downside to me, because I don't know if my ear holes are just mis-shaped ... but nothing stays in there, constantly pushing back into to stay in place. Wife has the same experience. Spend more time trying to make sure they aren't falling out than anything else.  Guaranteed that we lose at least one of them if we take these out of the house.Naively I thought you'd just hear things better. I wasn't expecting that the amplification would be bringing  other so much extra noise. Using the phone's keyboard, putting silverware away ... every click / pop / ding is more prominent.Your own voice / clearing your throat can cause all sorts of shocking noise in your ears.Sit near a window, and the birds chirping will be delightful to hear, but that's not really what I wanted to get out of these.  I simply find that they are more distracting than actually helpful, it's just added too much noise, and not enough clarity.The App has several modes (Dialogue, Restaurant, Commute, Outdoors) as well as advanced settings for setting attributes about the tone ... but fiddling with the slider bars really doesn't seem to tune the results of them enough to change the value of using them.I think we will stick with using closed captioning on the TV and repeating ourselves during conversations."
160,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,The best hearing aids I've had!,"I am reviewing these after trying many different types of hearing aids, even professional ones ordered by a specialist (over $3k).  These are very comfortable and I like the way that they stay in your ear.  Very natural sound and no squeeling.  You can set them up to your phone and if you need to adjust the sound, you can do it with an app on your phone.  Charges quickly and holds a charge well.  I can watch TV now without having to read the captions, even while kids are screaming in the same room.  These are a life changer for me!"
160,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,Poor,Sound quality for hearing people was poor
160,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice option for budget-conscious needs, but falls short against pricier competition","In-the-Ear Hearing Amplifier: $399.99 at the time of reviewI'm not the kind of person who needs to hide the fact that he's aging from anybody. I'll be the first person to admit when I can't do something as well as I used to in my youth. I'm not exactly old as I write this review, but I'm no spring chicken either. One of those things that slowly has been getting worse over time is my hearing. Now, my hearing isn't so bad that I feel that I need to go in for an official exam and start looking at the multi thousand dollar hearing aids. But I'm also not above self diagnosing and self treating some beginning level hearing loss. So when I saw these Bluetooth headset looking hearing aids I figured they'd be a good middle ground.*What I liked*:I'll start by mentioning the fact that these really are designed to look and behave like a Bluetooth headset (right down to the charging case). Now, I'd like to point out that my basis for comparison for a device like this is the Apple AirPods Pro 2. Those have been my favorite headset for a very long time (well, AirPods in one form or another). I recognize that they aren't hearing aids (but as I write this rumors are floating around about Apple adding a hearing aid mode). But they are the next closest thing in my life. I mention all of this because these are clearly designed to look like a Bluetooth headset to fit in. To that end they work.As far as non-hearing performance goes, these are pretty easy to use. They work much like any other wireless earbuds with a charging case. The case itself gets plugged into charge and the earbuds get charged via contact inside the case. Like Apple AirPods, they're easy to just toss in your pocket and take out and use when you need them (crowded restaurant, public spaces, etc.). As someone who's not afraid of a smartphone, I also really appreciate the app. It gives you individual stats such as battery charge, volume, and hearing mode settings, and lets you change all of those things with a touch of a screen.As far as hearing performance goes, I found these to be decent. now that I don't have a basis of comparison for one of the pricier multi thousand dollar doctor prescribed hearing aids. So that considered, I found them to be pretty good. They definitely improve my ability to understand conversations in a crowded place. And, like my AirPods, I can use them as a Bluetooth headset to listen to music or podcasts on my phone.*What I didn't like*:You know, I don't really have any specific complaints here. Understanding that the competition in the space is also quite expensive, I won't consider the price in my review (even though $400 is quite a bit more than even Apple’s expensive AirPod Pros). That being said, for someone who doesn't have a prescription hearing aid (and so doesn't have doctors orders to use something like this) I find it hard to justify the high price tag even though they are somewhat useful in a crowded space.*The Bottom Line:*Ultimately I think this is a good option for somebody looking for a hearing aid that can double as a Bluetooth headset, at least until Apple releases a hearing aid mode for their AirPod Pros. The price is high to me, but in the hearing aid market it's actually pretty reasonable. The performance is decent enough in a crowded space that I think this could be useful for a good number of people looking for better hearing. The added bonus of being able to pair it with a phone or TV is also nice. I feel pretty comfortable giving this headset four stars out of five. I think it accomplishes most of what it sets out to do. Honestly though, I probably wouldn't order this over again and just hold out to see how good the hearing aid mode is in Apple’s headset (which I already own)."

160,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Reliable and Comfortable Hearing Aid for Seniors,"The LINNER Mars Hearing Aids have greatly improved my quality of life. As a senior with mild hearing loss, I was hesitant to try hearing aids, but these have exceeded my expectations. The in-the-ear design is discreet and comfortable to wear for extended periods. The noise-canceling feature effectively reduces background noise, allowing me to focus on conversations more easily. Additionally, the rechargeable battery eliminates the hassle of constantly replacing batteries. With adjustable volume control, I can customize the sound to my preference in different environments. Overall, these hearing aids have been a valuable assistive device for me, enhancing my ability to communicate and participate in daily activities."
160,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Better Quality Than Others,"These hearing aids/hearing amplifiers are a step above others I've tried.  They are quite a bit more expensive but offer better sound quality and added features that meet my needs. The app makes adjusting the settings easy.  I really like that the amplifiers connect to my phone and TV.  Another feature I read on LINNER Mars website, is that these are IPX5 water and sweat-proof."
160,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Premium set of hearing aids,"The Linner Mars hearing aid excels in its adjustability and customization options, making it ideal for both hearing assistance and enjoying music or streaming services like Netflix. Its sleek design ensures it blends seamlessly, often going unnoticed as a hearing aid. I particularly appreciate its long-lasting battery life and premium case. The earpieces, made of rubber-like material and available in various sizes, ensure a perfect fit for my ears. Additionally, its noise-canceling feature enhances clarity, and the ability to adjust settings via a phone app adds convenience. Look no further in your search for your next exceptional set of hearing aids"
160,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Comfortable and good sound quality,"These hearing amplifiers are designed for people who have minor to moderate hearing loss. Although these are smaller and more comfortable to wear, I do prefer the ones that look like AirPods better. The hearing amplifier is Bluetooth enabled and you can adjust the features on your cellphone after downloading the APP. The sound quality is superb with much less background noises.  I wear these at home only for basic needs such as watching TV. It has worked very well for me so far."
160,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,I can watch tv without excess volume bothering others,The aids are relatively small and they are working well when I’m watching tv. I no longer have the volume at a level that annoys others. I’m also able to hear more when I’m interacting with others I notice I’m not saying “what” whenever I’m spoken to. I’m wearing them a bit more each day getting used to them in my ears is taking about a week. Nobody has even noticed them in my ears I’m thinking they think it’s from my phone as most friends have EarPods in all the time. I’m still partially deaf but I can hear more a big improvement
160,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth the Money - This Sound Amplifier Works Great and Comes with an Awesome App,"For the money you get much better circuitry then the less expensive ones. This is very noticeable - as soon as I put them on I was impressed with the sound and I have ones that are 25% of this price.And out of the box - zero feedback issues so no squealing as you are setting them up.This comes with a very sophisticated app that allows many different modes ""like restaurant"" and these actually do work well.It also has a feature so you can use it to hear outside sounds and Bluetooth streaming at the same time.So these are small, comfortable and feature filled with great sound."
160,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,The best OTC hearing aid I've seen/used,"Easy app download for my Android Phone.  Works without the app but works much better with it and there are advantages to controlling the hearing aids from your phone.  With the hearing aids in while using the music player on my phone, the hearing aids work as high end ear buds for playing music.  If using the app and you go out of range of your phone's bluetooth, the disconnect and reconnect is seamless, a quick message plays telling you the status and that's it.  If going out of range, the volume control reverts to using the controls on the aids themselves.  Offered in white or black I chose the white.  Unless you have long hair these are very noticeable, there's no hiding 'em.  I have hearing aids, ordered through a VA audiologist, that cost over three grand.  These are much better as far as comfort, ease of use, versatility than my VA aids.  If you don't mind people seeing 'em these are a much better option, IMHO."

160,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,EXPENSIVE JUNK,"As my wife and I are both getting older and our hearing are on different levels. So I  thought these newer type hearing aids might be the answer, since they work with both Bluetooth for your phone or music and a amplifier for TV watching or general use.. At this point I  have tried 3 different makes and these have been the worst and most expensive of them. First problem is that it is almost impossible to adjust the volume.  The next problem is once you get them working is the sound quality is extremely poor. So basically there are a worthless piece of junk. Others we have tried worked quite a bit better and were hundreds of dollars less money. I would definitely recommend staying away from this product."

My only problem is that they are really big outside of the ear. I don't think I would wear them outside of the house.
160,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Quite nice,"These aids are pretty nice. I got these mainly because they look almost like regular in ear headphones, so I could have them at times to not look like I am wearing aids. The battery life is definately more in line with typical headphones rather than aids, so they are not really to wear all day long. I think the look of them works for me and the charging case is nice. The sound quality is pretty good, nothing I have really noticed wrong there. It does do well at boosting the frequencies of people talking which is great. There is a bunch of configuration in the app too. Overall a great set that doesn't look like aids, but also doesn't have the battery life of aids."
160,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Comfortable,I got these hearing aids for my husband hence he had lost his old ones. This design is very comfortable for ears and fits like a charm.

160,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Just the boost I need, and so many features.","These earbud hearing aids are amazing. They have so many features.  First, they fit so nicely, without a bunch of adjusting. They connected quickly. The app is required but is actually pleasant to use. There are modes to isolate sound, and they also function as regular earbuds. They don’t have the longest battery life but there’s a sufficient amount for my needs. This is saving me from a more expensive way to assist my hearing. The sounds are crisp. Don’t have the volume up too much, it can rather jolting. Absolutely recommend. After giving here a good test I’m thrilled with  my choice.  I don’t need the boost hearing all the time, more in certain situations so these are exactly what I needed."

The first (Nova version) sounded severely tinny and despite long effort and moderate knowledge of hearing loss (physician, internal medicine and geriatrics) and audio technology (Amateur Extra Ham radio) I could not get them adjusted. This version, Mars, is delightfully better and genuinely helps my understanding of both voices and the TV.Phone app is convenient, and intuitive, makes adjusting the earbuds much easier than tapping codes on the buds themselves.Appearance? Compared with the Nova version, the Mars is smaller but still obvious in the ear. To me, the Nova version looks like Apple  ear buds, the Mars version like the hearing aids they actually are.Pairs with my phone or media center computer easily and effectively. When paired with an audio source (phone calls, music on the phone or computer) does limit some environmental sound, but not so much as to loose situational awareness.Package note: The black inner section of the box does not slide out; see the picture. The side of the box with the big MARS letters lifts up, has a magnetic catch.Overall, I find them useful, comfortable and surely worth their cost.."
160,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing,"these hearing aids are very cost friendly for what they provide. They have a lot of features on them as compared to other brands for the price. They fit great into the ears.

I have been fighting against getting hearing aids for awhile now, but with these I don’t think I’ll need them.  They have greatly improved my hearing.  While they are somewhat comfortable, I’ve found I need to get used to having something in my ears, so I’m wearing them a little each day & building up to all day usage.  They certainly seem a bit pricey, but I find the sound quality to be really good, and they’re way less expensive than hearing aids from an audiologist.  I’m happy with this product."
160,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,LINNER mars hearing aids,"This is a excellent set of hearing aids. You have to install the app on your phone to take the test and the app will adjust the hearing aids when finished. The sound quality is like my prescription set, I can't tell the difference. The case can be charged by wire or wireless. They are comfortable to wear and easy to use. They have Bluetooth so you can use them with your cell phone. You can adjust everything right from the app so you don't have to touch them at all. I also suggest you get a hearing aid dryer and dehumidifier to keep them in tip top shape, you can get that here on Amazon. I also encourage people to try these first before you go spend $5,000.00 to $6,000.00 on a prescription set because these may be all you need. If you buy any hearing device, I recommend using them 2 hours a day for the first week and increase 2 hours each additional week till you are comfortable with them. It can take up to two months so please be patient. Also they are eligible for a refund or replacement within 30 days so there is nothing to lose but a little time."

33,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great first time set,"My wife was tested five years ago and was found to have some hearing loss which we knew on our own. She test drove a set of (at the time) 7K dollar hearing aids and they were inside the ear canal hearing aids. It was not a good match for her so we decided to postpone that for the time being. Now she has noticed more loss and a friend allowed her to try his set on for just a short while at a dinner party and that was a great help. These are behind the ear and have a better sound than the 7K dollar set. So much so that I ordered this set for her right away and she has been using them for a month now and she likes using them, the charging case is convenient and the charge seems to last her almost all day at work.Wearing hearing aids for the first time is no cake walk and it does take some getting used to and this set has helped her to acclimate herself to just Using hearing aids that it gives us time to consult a audiologist and get better info on new sets as the technology gets better all the time. Most likely we will keep these in the top drawer for the backup set because as we all learn...two is one and one is none. 😉"
33,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,"So far, so good","These are the first hearing aids I have owned, and this is day one of using them. The information, ordering, shipping all went well.  The instructions are clear and the initial first impressions are positive.  4 stars only because the ""hearing part"" of my experience is obviously limited."
33,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Do not fit,"They might be great hearing aids for someone with a smaller head may be a woman, but I’m not trying to say one thing or another. They just do not fit my father’s head and ears. It was very hard to get them set up in the first place to start. But the wire was not long enough to go into my dad’s air canal. So I have to give these a one star rating because they do not list fitting better in their description."
33,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product,One doesn’t have to spend thousands of dollars to get great hearing aids. I wished I had learned about these sooner.
33,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Work for my needs,"I need BTE hearing aids because they are stronger than the smaller in-ear ones. I was worried that these would be uncomfortable, they're not bulky or cumbersome."
33,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Came out best from 4 tested,"I bought 4 different OTC hearing aids, and this one came out best. Audian BTA came out best, but it is rather expensive. It was closely followed by the Lentorgi rechargeble which was almost 1/3 of the price after coupon. As my hearing is not all that bad, I chose the latter. Earcentric and a no-name very similar one followed after that which was OK but the Lentorgi was better in noise suppression. Moreover, the Lentorgi has 4 environmental modes, as opposed the Earcentric and no-name have only 2 modes, which really is not enough for all conditions."
33,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Useless customer support,"Best hearing aids I have ever had. The product serves me well as an associate in a loud home improvement store. However, the standard domes were worthless and kept following out. Customer service has been totally irresponsive. I asked on three occasions for them to answer on how to order more of the grey RIE domes. . They sent me some in the original package but I could never find out how to get more. My own research and thanks to Amazon I found them on their site. Fit perfect and the sound is right on."
33,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,One aid didn’t chargeI returned the hearing aids 9/23/2023 and have not been refunded,"One aid would not hold a charge for greater than 15 minutes. Returned aids Sept 23, still waiting for refund on Oct 30Nov 19th still awaiting $412 refund. 😳😳"
33,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Works really well.,"I’ve purchased custom hearing aids from audiologists in the past. These work nearly as well for a fraction of the cost. While the Audien hearing aids aren’t custom programmed to my hearing defects, these do work well in amplifying the sounds around me and really improves my ability to hear conversations and details I might miss. These are pretty comfortable and fairly light weight. I didn’t know what to expect when I got these but I’m pretty satisfied."
33,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,for the price an excellent value,Got caught out in the rain and 1 hearing aid stop working.  They are susceptible to getting wet.  Got it replaced with no problem.
33,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perform well,"I'm thrilled with the performance of these things, especially considering their affordable price. It holds its ground against expensive options and feels comfortable even sitting on the ear."
33,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,No customer service,The BTE aides worked as stated with no noise filtering. My right ear unit stopped working 40days into the 45 day return offer. Ias not offered a repair or replacement just pushing to sell an extended warranty. Upon requesting a return authorization several times and they finally relented. I just received authorization of my refund but minus $25 for a discount coupon used at time of ordering. This is NOT a 100% refund as stated. Also  never received any customer service follow up after my initial order.
33,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Volume easily adjusted!,"I'm loving the ease of use  of these aids, they have simple buttons that make adjusting the volume really easy while you're wearing them."
33,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Go for it,Don't underestimate the power of this hearing aid! It competes with expensive alternatives in terms of sound precision and amplification.
33,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fit secure,"I'm loving the fit of them, they stay in place no matter what I'm doing."
33,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Rechargeable, Convenient n easy to use","Love my Audien hearing aides.  This is second pair as I was in icu hospital n one got lost. Audien is very responsive. These are great!  Sound quality is excellent!  Easy to work with.I recommend Audion OTC rechargeable hearing aides who's looking for good value n purchase price.No more having to buy batteries; charge overnight; choice of dome sizes to fit the ears correctly; having 4 different modes for to fit ones needs -outside, restaurant setting; tv; music; or simple conversation in the house/car w/husband - all works. Convenient charging case can travel w/you if needed. Customer service support is great-texting or email or even by phone.  The BTEs are new to Audien system but they understand ones needs. Would recommend the BTE hearing aids for those who can't use the in/ear style."
33,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Better than my $$ pair.,"I've tried high-end hearing aids before, but this BTE model matches their quality at a fraction of the cost. Feels good in the ear, not plugged up."
33,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth it.,"This BTE hearing aid is a hidden gem! It rivals the performance of much pricier models, providing clear and natural sound without breaking the bank."
33,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works for me,"These hearing aids are great, I had no trouble figuring out how to adjust the volume to my needs. It only took me a couple of tries to get hem set right."
33,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,It works.,"This BTE hearing aid works. The sound quality is remarkable, and it even outperforms most of the more expensive models I've tried."
33,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,4.5 and rising,"Bought these to replace the Atom. Immediately noticed better clarity,sound direction and differences when using the 4 modes. I’m still working on when to use the modes. But, so far it seems like an excellent product."
33,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,No itching,"I'm really happy with the feel of these aids, they sit comfortably in my ears and I can wear them all day without any itching."
33,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Surprised but happy,I was surprised this actually worked for me. it gives good sound clarity and a comfortable design that doesn't sacrifice sound quality.
33,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,they are worth every dollar you pay for them,They perform as good or better in some cases as the one the hearing aid company showed me that cost with my insurance 4500
33,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Price and fit are perfect,"The fit of these aids is just right, they don't feel to tight or loose. The price is right too!"
33,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Satisfied,I can't believe the quality of this hearing aid for the price. It performs just as well as the expensive ones I've tried.
33,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,product produces feedback and doesn't work for tv,returned product as it didn't work for tv and produced significant background noise.  Had trouble getting reimbursed for purchase even though it said it could be returned.  Not happy with this product.
33,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Hard to use - works fair,"I have arthritis in my fingers and find it impossible to repute wax filter. Audie doesn't sell and ear pod with pre-instead filters. So once I run out of the original ear pods and the filter can no longer be cleaned, the hearing aids will wind up in the trash. A waste of $s."
33,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Poor quality,JunkSave your moneyHorrible customer service

167,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Just as advertised. Looks Great!,"They haven’t been used yet, but I checked them out well, and it looks of good quality. Charging now. Will update after the month has passed. The battery packs  were easily taken out and replaced, the hearing tubes and domes were also easy on and off. So don’t expect it to be too complicated. The instructions are well written and came well packaged."
167,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Priced right.  Very servicable hearing device for those with moderate to severe hearing loss.,I like the availability of service this company provides.  Accessories and replacement parts should be easily available if needed.  The sound quality isn't the best but once I got them adjusted to the right loudness they worked fine.
167,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very impressed,"Purchased these for my mother and after finally getting her to try them, she loves them.  They work really well and help her hear conversations, and TV with volume in a normal level.  I am so grateful for this product.  Just ordered replacement tubes and people were so helpful with the purchase.  Would recommend these to anyone needing help with hearing."
167,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great replacements at an affordable price,"I was tired of losing expensive hearing aids and replacing batteries.  These are the perfect size and ample volume, well worth the money!William Silknitter"
167,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best hearing aids l have had,I bought these for.r my husband and he has had other aids but these are better than all of others. He likes because of the ease of use and the clear sounds.
167,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"very is to set up fits really nice,","i' ve had these for 6 days now, wearing them 6 to 7 hours a day, so far, they have been working great very pleased with everything about them. Good value for money.one note i did not get the carrying case with the purchase. I would still rate everything as a 5 plus, shipping was fast and well packed"
167,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Comfortable and I can hear again,Very reasonably priced and is helping me hear again.  I have never worn a hearing aid before but was glad I chose EarCentric for my first hearing aid.
167,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,how you set them up,i think they are great and would tell others about them
167,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works better than expensive prescription aids,"I was skeptical, but after putting them on and trying them out for the first time, they work MUCH better than the expensive prescription hearing aids.  They work very well and the cost of replacement tubes/domes is very reasonable."
167,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Satisfied,So far these hearing aids are working well.As far as longevity will have to wait and see.
167,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,Only a sound amplifier,One became hard to activate until it became impossible to turn on. There is a delicate balance between adequate volume and too much which distorts everything. I wouldn't recommend these to my worst enemy.
167,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Ist day Great Product!,The hearing aids are easy to use and work as good or better than other models I have used.
167,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Working good so far,"Seem to be fine, helped with hearing loss,"
167,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,good for you,"Before these hearing aids, my relative was constantly struggling to catch every word in conversations, often leading to misunderstandings and frustration. People had to raise their voices for him to hear, which, as you can imagine, was not a pleasant situation for anyone. Now, he gleefully tells me how clear and crisp every word sounds, thanks to these devices. He's rejoined conversations and is enjoying social gatherings without missing a beat."
167,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best I have used,"By far bestI have had other hearing aid more expensive than these but these are the best hearing aids that I have used. I used the other ear centric hearing aid before,but these are even better."
167,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,If I could give 6 out of 5 stars. Great idea to lower ownership cost,"One of our friends recommended these hearing aid to us. I have placed an order for my husband and  another one for my sister-in-law. They are both satisfied and grateful with their units. They can now hear the TV clearly at normal level, and glad that we can now talk to them without yelling. What differentiates this hearing instrument from others: Removable rechargeable batteries.  My husband's old hearing aids refuse to hold a charge for more than 30 minutes after 2 years of normal use. It's a pity to say goodbye to a pair of $3000 hearing aids just because of bad batteries inside. DiscoPlus' removable design means we can easily swap out batteries — that means no time lost charging, and we can quickly ditch degraded batteries.  Definitely a life changing decision we've ever made. We are so satisfied and will recommend these to others also because of it's quality and affordability."
167,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent Technology that cost less,"I am satisfied with this hearing aid. This is my second pair from this company. The first pair is still working but I lost one taking motorcycle on and off that's why I purchased another one. The sound quality is clear and it's comfortable to wear. The product was packed properly when I received them. This pair cost a little bit more than my other pair but it comes with 4 removable batteries and a 4-port charger. I can charge 2 devices + 2 backup batteries at the same time. In the long run, I feel it will cost less because I just need to replace the battery to keep it fresh. I highly entrust Earcentric for the quality."
167,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent product. Highly Recommend,"Bought these to replace MD hearing aids I had for 2 years. These are a step up! They are slightly longer than the MD rechargables, but very comfortable. I have 60% loss in right ear, 30% loss in left ear. Using the medium ear domes fit great with no feedback or whistling. I have been wearing aids for 8 years and these outperform the expensive ones at a faction of the cost."
167,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,My 92 year old mom can hear me now!,"These hearing aids really work at high quality. I bought these for my 92 year old mom. My mother never had a difficult time using it. She has different hearing loss on each ear. This hearing aid has on-body volume control so that she can adjust the amplification individually. She can easily adjust it on her own and she said that the manual is super easy to understand, especially on how to charge them. She did not know how to replace the removable battery so she called customer service for help. Mary was nice and knowledgeable to help us out. We are so happy that we don't have to repeat ourselves when talking to her."
167,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,I can swap batteries when they are low on juice,"The product arrived quickly, the manual was very very easy to follow, and the charging time is so fast. So far they have been working well for me. Because of the price, I wasn’t sure what to expect, but the sound is crystal clear. It is aso good as the prescription hearing aids I had before that cost 5 times as much. I lost my medical insurance and so prescription hearing aids were no longer available to me. The sound is amazing. These proved to be louder and clearer than my expensive hearing aid. This is barely noticeable, they are hidden behind my ears. And also the rechargeable batteries means no more expense of purchasing regular batteries. And yes, the removable nature of the battery means I can swap batteries when they are low on juice. 4 battery modules come with the package as a bonus! I am very pleased with this product."

167,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works much better than expected,"I have normal age-related mild hearing loss. These hearing aids seem to be made exactly for my degree of loss as soft voices once again are clear and understandable. For the price, these just can’t be beat! I also like the detachable rechargeable batteries that make these hearing aids last when other rechargeables have lost their recharging capabilities. There is also a second set of rechargeable batteries included and new ones can be ordered on the Ear Centric website. Thanks Ear Centric for a really great product!"
167,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Product Cheap Price !,My father in law's unable to hear for more than 5 years. We're so happy that this hearing aid available to purchase on Amazon. It is easy to use and work good better that the $3K hearing aid. Great EARCentric
167,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,These are a decent set of amplifiers,"My mom is 92 and was noticeably losing her hearing due to her asking to repeat ourselves and other people during conversations. She had gotten an ear exam by an ENT and audiologist. The results were that her hearing was of a moderate to severe loss in both ears. I spoke to her primary care physician, and he recommended to seek a reasonably priced, basic pair of amplifiers that could be purchased via Amazon. And so I did, and came across these and it's reviews and quickly realized which was going to be my next decision and decided on these. My mom has been wearing them for a few days so far and is saying that she does hear better now and I confirm that she isn't asking to repeat ourselves much since. These are a decent set of amplifiers that pretty much do the same thing those really e4xpensive ones do, minus some key features and obvious better clarity."
167,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,"They keep failing. I keep returning them to get fixed. Now, no more contact","It's too bad both hearing aids failed several times. They worked the best of the 3 brands I tried if I kept the volume at 2 or below (screeching feedback). I returned them each time at my cost, and with a few calls and emails, they would eventually return working ones to me, only to fail again. DON'T WAST YOUR MONEY. I bought excellent prescription hearing aids on a payment plan that doesn't charge interest for 6 months and it has made all the difference!  I wish Amazon wouldn't sell OTC aids!"
167,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best set for the price,"They work exceptionally well. I purchased the set with extra batteries. I had a technical question on day two, called them and the solved a small issue. The best set for the money I've ever purchased."
167,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,first day...,"I just opened the box and looked at my new pair of hearing aids...my very first ones! I take them out of the case and can figure them out easily without reading the manual on how to turn them on, and how to place them in my ears. YES, THIS EASY! And now I smile...I hear sounds again, I have not heard for years...went outside and the birds have so much more to say compared to without hearing aids in my ears. If you have like me severe hearing loss confirmed by a medical professional, but you are low-income, then I do highly recommend these hearing aids from EarCentric. They do have some futures, but what is more important than futures is how they work, and what they do deliver to you...and I am amazed by the sounds I do hear again...sounds I was forgotten that did exist..."
167,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Working good so far,"I got these for my dad, and so far he seems to really like and enjoy them…He says he can hear very well now, and there hasn’t been any issues with this product at all so far"
167,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Happy so far.,My 94 year old mother broke her expensive hearing aid. She wanted to try this one because it was reasonably priced and had great reviews. So far she can hear better than with the old one. It's a little different so she needs to learn how it works. So far so good.
167,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love the rechargeable and replaceable battery packs,Only brand I found that has the rechargeable and replaceable battery packs. My previous hearing aids from a different manufacturer died due to the rechargeable battery failing. My old ones died after 14 months. Looking forward to these lasting a while.
167,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Review for earcentric replaceable batteries hearing aids,I like the overall performance of this product.  We ordered this unit about 9 months ago and the right ear just totally stopped working recently.  We decided to stay withThis model so that I did not have to go through a whole new learning curve.  They are for my 95yo aunt who has lived with us since January of this year.  These have beenVery helpful for her
169,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great deal!,"Earcentric offered this bundle and I had to take advantage. I travel frequently and the travel charger is perfect for on the go. I already had a pair of Earcentric hearing aids that my family gave me over a year ago, but it never hurts to have a backup pair. The travel charger is normally $80 so for me it was worth purchasing the bundle. The hearing aids work great. My quality of life has improved 99% since I've been using them. Also  customer service is excellent. I've always been very satisfied with their responses in resolving any issues I've had. I highly recommend Earcentric. (J.F.)"
169,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing Difference In Hearing,"Why I Got The Hearing aids in the first place, I was in a car accident when I was 20 yrs old(48 now) and had Belle's Palsy on the right side of my face. Which led to hearing loss in my right ear.  Since then my Hearing has always sounded muffled and got worse over time. Now my hearing loss was mild to moderate, if someone has more severe hearing loss I'm not sure these would help. For Me They Work Perfectly! No they are not high tech like most hearing aids,but they are an absolute great value for the price. Best Decision I made in a long timeAfter charging the hearing aids over night before using them to make sure they have a complete charge. I put just the one in my right ear and I can tell you how much of a difference it made, I was able to hear my girlfriend in another room. Also was able to hear her with her back turned to me. Before I knew she was talking I couldn't make out the words that she was saying.  Another thing I was Able to turn the TV to half (From20-10) of what I had it on before.Just make sure you read the instruction book before you do anything.  The instructions are pretty simple to understand.  Make sure you use the ear piece that fits in your ear comfortably,I had to change the one that it came on the hearing aid to a smaller one.Be prepared to hear the smallest noises that you didn't hear before. It can be a bit over whelming at first , but you get use to it pretty quick. It almost trains your brain to process these noises again.Extremely Happy with These Hearing Aids!"
169,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Good hearing, noise with wind",They did a decent job for the price. We returned because his ins would cover a better product. On a windy day the noise was tough on the ears and if you reached up to adjust a hat or glasses the backfired was nit so great.
169,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice Bundle,Bundle for the BTE and portable charger great value for the price. Hearing aids are easy to apply and fit comfortably over ear for a discreet look. Good quality casing on both the aids and charger.  I do not wear these full time but the batteries are lasting me a good couple days usage between charges.  I must add that while wearing it does not cancel out the room dehumidifier in the background. But the volume of voices and tv do come through clearly. I’ve only been using for a couple of weeks but it is a big improvement and not having to say “what?” all the time.
169,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works great,I’m happy with my purchase
169,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Better than anticipated,"I do like this product; its battery lasts longer than anticipated; it is very comfortable to wear. I am struggling with volume control… but I think that is a me thing, not the products. It does take time to acclimate to this product.  I am still trying to adjust to background noise issues. But again, I think I have become adapted to honing in on what I could hear not what I needed to hear as an alibi.  The volume is easy to control, sound is better than good most of the time; sometimes too good for me😂  For the price, it is outstanding!"

That is definitely a huge plus! And they are small enough for a comfortable fit."

180,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,It really works!!,"My father has hard time with hearing, and as he gets older getting worse. Looked up the hearing aid and price range was huge. Found this one with Prime deal. One of the nice thing was it has black color option, cause beige color looks too much hearing aid look :) As soon as he got it, he tried. With volume control button, he could adjust easily and right away he could feel big difference of hearing our voice. He was saying ‘Oh I can hear ppl are talking over there!’ With minimum invest, maximum result came out!"
180,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound quality,"My dad with time have been hearing issues, not to the point where he needs to wear it full time but when we visit and kids talking to him or when we watch movie I know he doesn’t get things all the way. This is perfect solution, that way we don’t have to turn tv volume higher for him and he can understand kids fully. It fits perfectly and he said sound is pretty clear. I think eventually he will wear it full time but for now it’s nice that he have that option when we coming over. It also barely noticeable as I know he might feel uncomfortable if people see it. It’s seems like a great option for now as he primarily just using it at home."

180,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great quality,"These hearing aids work beyond my expection and I am pleasantly suprised. Rather than spending hundreds on prescribed hearing aids, I came on Amazon to find something that would work but wouldn't make a dent in my bank account. This model jumped out at me and I have not been dissappointed. These hearing aids provides great sound amplification and noise reduction allowing you to clearly hear and focus on a conversation. The design is sleek and able to be camoflauged. They are so comfortable; I barely experience any irritation even after using it all day. Love them!"
180,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,It really works!!,"my dad uses hearing aids to help his hearing and he happened to have an Earrck model that was compatible with them, so I ordered them because his old tubes were getting dirty.

He was able to hear other people and the sounds around him clearly without stressing or missing any words."
180,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,A Game-Changer for My Hearing!,"I was skeptical at first, but these LINNER Saturn OTC Hearing Aids have truly been a lifesaver for me! As a 65-year-old retiree, I've struggled with hearing loss for years, and it's been getting worse over time. I've tried different types of hearing aids in the past, but they were either too bulky, uncomfortable, or didn't seem to make a significant difference"
180,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,very good,"Sound Quality: A good hearing aid should provide clear, natural sound without distortion or feedback.Comfort: Comfort is crucial, especially for long-term wear. Look for reviews that mention how comfortable the hearing aids are to wear for extended periods.Noise Cancellation: Effective noise cancellation can help improve speech clarity in noisy environments. Reviews may comment on how well the hearing aids block out background noise.Battery Life/Rechargeability: If the hearing aids are rechargeable, reviews might discuss battery life and how convenient it is to charge them.Design and Discretion: Many users prefer discreet hearing aids that are nearly invisible when worn. Reviews may mention how discreet the design is and whether it meets expectations in terms of appearance."

When you take them out of the box, they turn on automatically, and there is a button that indicates red and blue to identify the right and left earbud. You can increase the volume with a button located on the top, and there is a special pin that can be used to remove the earbuds. The most important thing to check is the fit, but overall, the product is amazing."

180,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Incredible Hearing Amplifiers for Enhanced Clarity and Comfort,"I am absolutely thrilled with my purchase of the LINNER Saturn OTC Hearing Aids! As someone who has struggled with hearing loss for years, I was skeptical about trying over-the-counter (OTC) hearing aids, but I'm so glad I took the plunge. These devices have been a lifesaver!First of all, the design is incredibly discreet and comfortable. The in-ear device is barely noticeable, and I've received countless compliments from friends and family who have no idea I'm wearing them. The earbuds are also very lightweight, which was a major concern for me since I have sensitive ears.But what really sets these apart is the sound quality. The noise cancellation feature is amazing - I can finally hear conversations in noisy environments without straining to hear every word. And the amplification is crystal clear, with no distortion or echo. It's like having my own personal sound engineer in my ear!I've noticed a significant improvement in my daily life since using the LINNER Saturn OTC Hearing Aids. I can now participate in group conversations without feeling left out, and I no longer struggle to hear my grandkids when they're playing in the background. It's been a game-changer for my social life and overall well-being.The rechargeable batteries are also a huge plus - no more worrying about finding spare batteries or dealing with annoyingly short battery life. And the charging case is compact and easy to use."
180,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,These are a really good buy!,"I bought these for my dad. He had some very expensive hearing aids but the batteries were too small for him to manage and required frequent changes. He stopped using them 10 years ago, but it was becoming obvious he needed some new ones. He didn’t want to go to the doctor again so I took a chance buying these. He immediately noticed a difference! We had him use them in church and he could hear the sermon! He was so impressed (which is hard to do) he told his best friend about them and he got a pair too! Hopefully he will also be impressed. My only reason for withholding a star is you have to be very precise putting them back in the case or the leads on the earbuds won’t connect with the ones in the case for recharging. They could have done a better job with that. I have to put them back in the case for my dad and I struggle a bit. Other than that, these are an excellent purchase for the price!"

20,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wonderful Sound Wonderful Product!,"I've had the CRE-E10s for one week and I'm still learning their capabilities...previously and for about two years I had worn Kirkland Phonak 9.0s which I'd purchased from CostCo...they were fine, but I eventually started looking for an OTC pair of hearing aids to help me with my moderate-to-slightly severe hearing loss.I researched OTC hearing aids for a few months and began focusing on the Sony CRE-E10s...I have been a long time Sony customer, having enjoyed everything from their high-end minidisc recorders to TVs to Sony's component stereo systems and headphones....so I was familiar with Sony's high audio standardsThese CRE-E10s may seem slightly high-priced for OTC  ($1300) but my Kirkland 9.0s were $1400, so I knew these Sony OTCs were in fact reasonable in price...on arrival and unboxing I examined the CRE-E10s and they are substantial in weight, but not too heavy and with a nice, luxurious feel and surface...With the CLICK SLEEVES on each hearing aid, the long, audio ""output"" part of the hearing aids fit right in the ear canal...(so far I'm using the medium-size click sleeves)...with a slight twist forward and a little wiggling, they sit safely and securely at the base of the ear, resting in front of the ear lobe area...they do not feel like they will fall out...BTW: I was in the exam chair on my back at the dentist yesterday and the hearing aids felt very secure in my earsAfter reading the little manual (there really aren't a lot of instructions) operation of these hearing aids was easy and intuitive to me, plus some trial and error. I found a quiet spot in my house and proceeded with the Sony hearing test to determine the state of my hearingThe test was essentially listening for 0-3 beeps and indicating how many beeps I heard...I passed my left ear test then completed the test for my right ear...everything was good to go...the next step was to set a proper volume level manually for both ears...I set my overall volume at about 75...loud, but not harsh or overloaded. I would say this step is the most important...make sure you carefully adjust this ""post-hearing test"" volume level to your liking, because this level is the actual overall operating level of the devicesBy the way, I took the hearing test once, but the hearing aid sound seemed very unbalanced with feedback...I decided to take the hearing test again and the sound I heard was beautiful and near-perfect. I would suggest taking the hearing test honestly, don't try and cheat the test...if you hear or don't hear beeps just be honest and indicate which beeps you really hear. The hearing test seems to be the process with which the devices are calibrated for one's ears (it's not really a ""pass/fail"" test...but I could be wrong)My hearing aids were set up, but I waited until the next morning to explore their functions and to try them while watching TV, driving my car, walking outside ...the HEARING CONTROL app (for iOS only) is very simple...VOLUME on one screen and TREBLE/BASS on the next screen...the third screen shows a DIRECTIONAL HEARING control and a AUTO buttonI have my hearing aids set quite loud, and have been experimenting between AUTO setting and DIRECTIONAL setting...as mentioned above, yesterday I had a dentist visit (root canal!) and used the directional setting for ""forward"" - I could hear everyone in the office fine - I like to listen to music in my car and have been experimenting with the settings...AUTO can often be too loud with too much audio coming into my ears...BUT in general, music listening via hearing aids with my car speakers playing is amazing...high-end treble is clear, with good mid-range and solid bass. These hearing aids pick up even tiny sounds in my car, so I keep them set at about ""5"" - I love music and haven't heard music like this in years...the hearing aids are clear-sounding, and bring out audio details in albums and songs I forgot existedStreaming SPOTIFY directly through these CRE-E10s is easy and satisfying...there's a little icon near any Spotify app music stream that says ""AIRPLAY OR BLUETOOTH""...click on that icon and the music flows into the Sony hearing aids...simple! The streaming sound is very high end, clear stereo and rich, good treble and bass...the hearing aids act like real super high-end ear buds...the music streaming alone is worth the cost of these hearing aids...streaming YouTube and Internet or podcasts audio work well, too...I have a slightly older iPhone and the connection between them and these hearing aids is greatOVERALL I give these Sony hearing aids a ""9"" or a ""10"" - I would like to see a couple of new functions on the HEARING CONTROL APP (maybe there's some way to open up the clarity of one's speaking voice while wearing the hearing aids, as my own voice seems muffled in my own head when I speak...though this is a minor quibble)I knew Sony would come through with these hearing aids and I'm very, very happy with them...my research payed off!...they've already made me a little more confident and willing to interact with people without saying ""WHAT?"" or ""HUH?""In short, Sony did a great thing by developing and putting these CRE-E10 hearing aids on the market...very much recommended!"
20,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Difficult to set up, impossible to charge consistently","Just when I got these dialed in, they started to recharge inconsistently.  Yes, I carefully cleaned them and the charger connections and the lights showed charging, but when removed, one or the other or both plugs showed low charge remaining.  Too expensive to chance the return window closing—any number of reviewers got caught short and therefore burned on this item. 30 days is a very short time for this product and of course, SONY is not of much help you during warranty (if reviews are to be believed).  Anyway, aside from the recharge situation, I was just getting these dialed in and they proved somewhat useful, but never ideal.  If it were not for the charging failure/difficulty, I’d have accepted them for what they were with my needs. I’m convinced you’d benefit from a fitting with a professional audiologist, which I suspect could be helpful with these ear aids as well as the more professional models.  As other reviewers stated, these ear buds have unique problems. 1) They tend to amplify all sound.  Specific frequencies can broadly be tuned, but the general effect is simply a raising of the ambient sound level. 2) Even more annoying is they amplify the sound of your own voice—regardless of “fine tuning”, which is helpful, but insufficient for me. 3) When set acceptably for conversation and TV, they amplify for other tasks as well, like handling objects close up—counting change, opening bags, etc.  Annoying at best.I do understand that all settings are personal as to one’s particular hearing loss.  Your mileage and therefore enjoyment may vary. I’m really gonna miss them, but can’t afford to chance a defectively designed product (charger)."
20,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are NOT hearing aids but hearing amplifiers,"I purchased the Sony rechargeable for a number of reasons. Generally, Sony makes a high quality product and second Amazon is the best place to purchase b/c if you don't like them you can return them. I tried traditional hearing aids going through the tests and a high pressure sale. I tried the expensive pair and returned them. They fit well and had good integration with my iPhone. However, they were very difficult to put on even with several appointments, videos and the like. They were just not convenient so I returned them during the trial period. I researched all the brands and they had their plusses and minuses. The Sony's had the best hearing quality with the easiest to put on- almost like iPhone air pods but with a little extra push.They are comfortable for all day use and the battery lasts the full day.For face to face conversations whether in a quiet environment or a noisy restaurant- I could hear!But, keep in mind these are not air pods. You can stream music but the quality is like the 1960s.The biggest downside is the integration with phone calls. You cannot use them to make a phone call as they do not have a microphone. To make a call you have to be like one of those people who walk around doing a FaceTime call on the speaker. Everyone will hear your call and your responses. I recently retired as an attorney and if I was still practicing these would not work as I was always on the phone- in public or private. Again, these are hearing amplifiers. I hear conversations unlike any other device I tried.For me, the downside of the phone integration (which is probably to keep them small and longer battery life) is outweighed by the ampliphication. I love the recharging case- holds a charge to recharge them without needing a power source. They come with very easy to replace sizes for tips that go into your ears. And the Sony iPhone app is easy to work but not overly complicated. I look forward to upgrades which allow more customization - like one touch TV, noisy restaurants, or quiet encounters.I am a fan! But again, know what you are buying and what it doesn't do. Best of all- my wife loves that I wear them as I don't have to turn up the TV as loud. Honestly, I think she needs a pair but wont admit it!"
20,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not for me but maybe you - LONG time for refund,"I don't like these but I think hearing aids are a very personal choice so I figured I'd give them a try. I like the bluetooth as you can listen to your music, books, get phone calls, etc. I don't like that you can't just tap them - like the AirPods - to turn off or pause or whatever. I never got the sound to sound normal but they tell me that that's almost impossible because if you are not hearing a lot of low sounds, you will now. No, I don't like that. BUT it's a personal choice. I am in the mild range of hearing loss so maybe a person with a high loss would benefit more. I am irritated that I dropped these off at UPS on May 17 and they tell me to expect a ""refund credited"" on June15. Sitting on my credit card, that draws interest."
20,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Satisfied mother -  setup is not ideal,"I got these for my 80+ y/o mother and helped her set them up to use with her iPhone. She's pretty tech savvy, but there's no way that she could have done this by herself. The printed manual uses a very small font and was out-of-date compared to the software (I mean, come on Sony, don't you know the customer here? It doesn't cost much to provide a large-print user manual and I think it is your ethical obligation to do so for the mostly older customers who will use these - this isn't rocket science).Fitting the devices into the ear was not intuitive. I let my mom put them in herself, but they wouldn't stay in. There was also a whistling noise when she put her hand near her ears to adjust them (a familiar sound with other hearing aid exposure I've had). I read the confusing instructions about the various rubber earpiece sizes and it sounded as if we changed from the default one to one of the 3 other options, it would destroy the default one. I don't know that this is correct, but that was what I decided. Not being willing to possibly destroy the default earpiece that actually might be the correct fit, I fussed with this for a while.I finally figured out that she had been inserting them in her ear upside down. LOL. They fit much better after rotating them. Now that she's worn them for a week she said the default size is probably the best. She has noted that they sometimes fall out when she chews. TMI, perhaps.After figuring out the fit, the setup process on the iPhone worked rather well, especially once I stopped relying on the printed instructions. There is an audio test process that requires the user to count the number of signals they hear, and the process wanders through both low and high pitched frequencies and different volumes to come up with a profile - for each ear. I think my mom might have been able to do this herself, but it was definitely easier for me to hold her iPhone and ask her to count how many sounds she heard. That took a while, but we didn't have any problems.And voila! She's got hearing aids that do help. She's commented that she can hear bird sounds better. She also says they help her hear the ""t"" and ""s"" sounds at the beginning of spoken words, which affected her ability to hear conversations before. She did have an issue where one hearing aid battery died during the day, but we believe at this point that she might not have seated that one in the recharger carefully enough overnight. I will update this review if we later determine there's a problem with the battery life.BTW: the reason we didn't do a prescription style hearing aids is that a big box retailer that sells them wanted her to essentially certify that her hearing difficulties were not due to some underlying physical condition - and she didn't want to go through that hassle. So we waited a few months for these OTC choices to be available and vetted by others.Everyone's hearing issues will be different, but overall I can say we are pleased with the end results. I do think more care should go into the setup process considering the target customer base.Update: This morning my mother informed me that the right earpiece did not charge fully last night. She said the lights indicated it was charging, but when she began using it she got a message that the one earpiece was 40% charged. I am going to reach out to Sony to see if they have suggestions. The Amazon window for returns closed yesterday (of course)."
20,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Better than most prescription hearing aids,"The media could not be loaded.
                



Pros: Rechargeable, comfortable, IOS-Android Compatible, stylish, affordable, over-the-counterCons: There should only be one way to insert and charge the left vs right side hearing aid. Unfortunately it can fit both ways and not charge properly. This will be an issue for elderlyAnother great product by Sony! This truly is an amazing product and I really want to help the public to overcome hearing difficulties. It's a long review but it's because I care and I want you to share my insights.Compared to prescription hearing aids $2000-$3000, these CRE-E10 are much more superior in every way. I have used several prescription hearing aids from Costco and MD offices and they are uncomfortable and difficult to use. Prescription hearing aid batteries don't last very long and to complicate matters are very difficult to install. Understand this product is for mild-moderate only, hopefully this Sony CRE-E10 will work for you.At Sony, listen up, make a stronger product line for moderate-severe hearing loss. This is a great medical product that will help the public!Note: For all those negative and low reviews, it is most likely user error. It may also be likely that the user has severe hearing loss such that the app hearing aid test setup prompts cannot be heard due to deafness.1.) Patience is KEY!2.) Own a smartphone!I was able to setup Sony CRE-E10s on both my Android Phone and Apple SE phone. There were no issues with Bluetooth and App synchronization3.) Check Fit! Fit matters! Try using the different sized silicone ear pieces. Improper fit inside the ear canal can result in not hearing the Sony app guide instructions and failing the hearing aid test. It was too loose the first time and ended up failing the test.4.) You can do it!If you have slight hearing loss - AND-  Technology Savvy with app installations on IOS or Android then this will be easy peasy.5.) Ask a Friend! After setup take them to lunch.I highly highly recommend asking a family, son, daughter, friend, or a neighbor that can help you set it up on your smart phone. Total time for setup ~15 minutes maybe up to 30 minutes, but remember it would take much longer driving to the doctor's office and having them test and configure your hearing aid.Urgent: Put contact name, phone number on the case. Elderly are very forgetful and will lose or drop it. Those are very expensive medical devices you might have a greater chance of them being returned"
20,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great hearing aids for a mild hearing loss,"The setup was easy as I use an iPhone.  It was a little louder than I wanted after the first initial setup/creating a profile via the Sony App.  (The profile creation goes through the hearing check and it customizes the setting for you). After that, I further adjusted the two areas, my voice being too loud, and another area where I wanted to reduce the volume a bit down.  I used the amplifier before. I can't compare it with other hearing aids.  It works flawlessly with the iPhone.  You can answer calls and it is just like the AirPod PRO.  The sound quality is great!  I can also listen to music from my iPhone/Apple Music.  It's like having a high-end wireless headphone with a hearing aid.  It's too new to comment on lithium batteries but I think it will be fine.  Before, I used it for the first time.  I charged it first until all three lights were turned green.  I strongly recommend this product!"
20,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Are you sure it’s working!?,"I unpacked it. As a technology lover person, never like Sony software so I’m fully right, it is not a user friendly products first of all. Installation is so hard. Because of have some trouble, call the customer service (Friday evening at 8.13 pm) but they are not working, today Friday and after 8 pm, plus they are not working on the weekend :( They after spend 2-3 hours for installation and configuration, it looks it doesn’t work, nothing changed in my right ear, just a digital very very week sound which is not understandable. After paying $1.300, it was so so so disappointment and return the product. When you check the Sony product web site, even you can’t find any details on the web for further infos etc. it’s very very bad product, software and support. Do not loose your money such as very very expensive earbuds, because it may not a hearing aid but can be $30 earbuds."
20,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great for hearing, but not great for streaming.","I've had these less than 24 hours.  I purchased them to compare to my current hearing aids that cost more than twice as much (and that I rarely wear).  This is a preliminary review and I'll update it when I've run these things through there paces.1. Fit - great.  My current CIC aids constantly work themselves out of my ears - I've tried every type and size of sleeve available, but it happens; eating, running, talking.  Anything that moves my jaw or bounces it around works them out.  The Sony CRE-E10s stay comfortable and firmly in place regardless of what I'm doing.  I usually have trouble with ear bud style devices due to surgery on my right ear - they tend to fall out, but these Sony aids stay.  Very happy about that.2. Setup - RTFI!  If you follow the instructions carefully, you'll get these things setup fairly easily.  Important - the app doesn't use Bluetooth to send instructions to the hearing aids; it uses high frequency sound from your phone speaker.3. Sound - good.  As good as my more expensive hearing aids and as good as the Eargo aids that I had a couple of years ago.  Music from our house speaker system sounds good.  I often get distortion from my CIC aids when listening to music or TV.  Doesn't seem to be a problem with the Sonys.  There is more mid-frequency boost (2k hz) than I need, but will be playing with the fine tuning for that.  The aids come with six pre-programmed sound profiles (pg 77 of the user guide), but they are apparently not selectable by the user.  I'm guessing the setup process selects the profile for you based on your response to the setup hearing test.  I'd really like to try profile three, but not sure how to get there.  The frequency response range is good 125 - 8000 hz (Eargo aids are only 250- 5500).  12 ms of latency though (vs 5.6 ms for Eargo) - guess I wasn't wrong last night when I perceived words lagging lips while watching those Law and Order reruns last night.  To be fair, there is some latency built into the TV audio processing as well so I was likely dealing with layered latency.3. Streaming.  These are not go-to devices for streaming music.  Okay for phone conversations, but bass response is missing when streaming music.  That's weird, because bass comes through okay when listening to external speakers.  Clearly the devices can produce bass sounds - so perhaps a software update can fix the lack of bass while streaming.  Listening to music reminds of listening to music on those small hand-held transistor radios that were so ubiquitous in the 1960s.4. The app.  I see a universal program but no ability to select or create other programs?  Maybe I'm missing something.  The app is almost identical to other hearing aid apps with regard to the user interface.  An ability to select or create other listening profiles in the app would be good.  How about a graphic equalizer for music.  I believe these hearing aids have more capability than the app is allowing me to squeeze out of them."
20,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Real OTC Hearing Aids,"I purchased the Sony CRE-E10 hearing aids from Amazon and have been using them for about a month. This is my first hearing aid. Because they are listed as a “FDA-Registered medical device”, I figured that Sony would not risk its reputation making a false claim. As far as I could determine online, there is no FDA registration database open to the public. I personally believe that these are actually FDA-compliant hearing aids and not simply an amplifier.Because tiny buttons on in-ear hearing aids are so small, I felt that a cell phone app would be more functional. As a 79-year-old, I’m not technologically out of it (yet) - though some senior people might be. I have an Android cell phone and the Sony app installed and connected to the hearing aids. To setup the hearing aids, there is a hearing test much like you would take at an audiologist - 0, 1, 2, or 3 beeps testing various hearing frequencies. When done, the hearing aids are programmed accordingly. The app does not display any results from the test which is missing functionality. I think my hearing loss is primarily in my right ear, but it would be nice to know and whether or not my loss in high or low frequencies.After setting up the hearing aids, you’ll need to experiment with some of the adjustments that are programmed into the app. Initially, I was driven crazy by extraneous noise that was being picked up. I was able to mute that. I still don’t like hearing my flip-flops, but I may experiment some more. At a bar, I found I couldn’t understand people across the table, so I adjusted the settings. The app merely presents one or more “solutions” (in sequence) so you’re not sure what is being changed. Sony might want to consider equipping the app with “help” or “information” functionality so users could understand what’s happening. I don’t think it’s rocket science. As a fall back, a more robust manual could be published online for download. At this point, I’m not sure what adjustments are actually in the hearing aids so I will probably re-execute the hearing test to reset them and go from there based on my experiences. Assuming the app keeps all of this information, a restore function might useful to return to a baseline. Knowing what had been adjusted (and how to back it out) would also be useful. I suppose having full Bluetooth connectivity to play music would be useful, but I wanted primarily hearing aids that worked.Physically, these ship with small sleeves. I am a 180-pound man so I found the medium sleeve worked best to fit the ear canal. They don’t go in too far. There was never any feedback. They “tickled” periodically initially, but I think that’s me and it disappeared with use. The charging box is somewhat of a joke. When plugged in, all 3 lights light and when fully charged they all remain steady green. I guess it’s Sony’s idea of a light show! Why when plugged in, the lights don’t go off is a mystery. I have to unplug and then plug in the USB cable. A green light running 24/7 for 365 days bugs me (as does things that are “off” but not really “off”). The small connectors between the hearing aids and the charging box are much too small and/or badly engineered. When you put the hearing aids in, you have to make sure that the orange light comes on and that you close the charging box carefully so as not to move the hearing aids. I cannot feel when the hearing aid is properly seated and in contact, but maybe I'll learn with use.I’m a real customer. These are my experiences. Yours may be different."
20,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Nice but looking for the next iteration,"I've had my Sony CRE-E10 rechargeable hearing aids for about 8 months now, so feel like I can write an honest review. I'll start by saying I mostly like them, while also acknowledging I'm on my 3rd set of them within the timeframe. What I like is that they are rechargeable, but still fit in the ear and not behind with the wire leads. I switched from the Bose OTC hearing aides because the behind the ears devices made it hard to wear glasses of any type and wires wouldn't stay in my ear and I was constantly having to push them in (after going through all the various sizes, sleeves, etc.). These Sony earbuds fixed that problem and once the sound is dialed in, they definitely help my hearing. The first issue I had with them is that they are very hard to get charging in the case. You have to ""fiddle"" with them to sit JUST right on the charging contacts. I originally thought my first pair was just problematic, but after receiving the 2nd set, I could tell it's just a design flaw. The 2nd issue I had with them was after trying to ""reset"" the sound profile, they wouldn't be recognized correctly in the app and after calling support, they sent me another set. I'll also point out that for the first problem set, they made me return the hearding aids BEFORE they would send me another set and didn't like that at all since you get somewhat dependent on having working hearing aids. The 2nd set, they sent the replacement and had me return the old set after receiving the new ones, which was much better. Another issue I have is with the app itself. The app takes you down some vey specific paths that you can't get back from. The profile setup takes about 30 minutes. I like that it does a test, but very hard to get back to these settings easily. I also don't like that it comes with only the ""closed"" sleeves as after switching to the ""vented"" sleeves I found the sound quality to be drastically more natural. Another minor complaint is that they only allow audio streaming from an iPhone. I realize that this is because iPhone created a special setting just for hearing aids that Google hasn't, but it would be really great to have that capability with these and Sony hasn't indicated at all that they are pursuing this with Google to make it available at some point. So, in summary, because they are in-ear and rechargeable, they are providing a workable solution for me, BUT if they could resolve some of the issues here, I think it would be a truly fantastic product. Looking forward to seeing a 2.0 version of this."
20,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Charging case problems.,I used this product off and on for a year. The charging case was always an issue.  They have stopped charging completely. Can I replace the case?
20,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent OTC Hearing Aids,"While I ended up purchasing mine directly from Sony, these are fantastic hearing aids, especially at the now lower price. They are well constructed and feel good in the ear. The set up to get a hearing profile was difficult and took me several hours, and I wasn’t sure I would be able to keep them. Eventually I got a profile to work and figured out how to get them to default on my iPhone for streaming and answering calls. Having online tech support was crucial for this (at least for me). Now that they are set up and I found the right size tips to use, they’ve been great! I am retired military and am waiting for a set of VA prescription aids and wanted a second pair to use now and when the prescription ones may need sent in for adjustments. They have good battery life for all day use at work, streaming games and music, and for tinnitus programs from Spotify or You Tube. The sound is good even though the program has limited features (the small sized tips seem to provide the best sound and still remain firmly seated). There is some noise in the Kansas wind, but it isn’t bad and hasn’t bothered me. Overall for an OTC hearing aid for under $1K, they are outstanding and I highly recommend them. Thank you Sony!!!"
20,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Better than RIC for me,"Bought these when they first came out more than a year ago.  I have mild to moderate hearing loss. I returned a pair of brand name expensive RIC hearing aids as they weren't being adjusted to my satisfaction. The Sony's are better for me in nearly every respect. They are easy to install and easy to self adjust and very comfortable.  The sound and speech perception is very good but the bluTooth steaming is mediocre like all other hearing aids I’ve tried. The only issue I’ve had is with the fiddly charging case. It takes a bit of fiddling to get the charging started, but once started they work fine. It greatly helps to wipe contacts after every use.  I wear them all day and they still have plenty of charge left by the end of the day.  I’m very pleased with this purchase."
20,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great for listning sounds directly not no great for iphone connectivity,"I waited for almost 6 months for FSA eligibility to purchase these OTC hearing aid devices and am very happy with the devices for non streaming sounds.  Listening in general incl sounds from TV etc works perfectly. Setting these devices with an iPhone was easy, once you download the SONY hearing aid app and create an account.  Default settings for Loudness & Volume were very high and I could hear myself breathing as well as every keyboard click.  Once I reduced loudness to minimum and volume to 4 in the app, it started sounding very natural and comfortable.  I did change the click sleeves to smallest and ear buds are comfortable enough to wear 12+ hours everyday.  Feel lot more comfortable than wearing any ear buds incl Apple Air pods. Charging using the case is very similar to other devices and air buds and battery life is excellent.If you are purchasing these devices for Bluetooth streaming with iPhone, I suggest to do more research.  The Bluetooth streaming connection is very fragile – one bud or the other constantly blanks out while I walk around with iPhone in my hand or in my pant pocket. I have not worn these on a subway ride yet but streaming music or podcasts is not same as other Bluetooth wireless headsets.  While the E10 are ""Bluetooth compatible for audio streaming,"" it's not the same. The E10 use the Apple proprietary MFi hearing aid protocol, and this audio version of MFi includes Sony's own proprietary audio codec, not AAC or Bluetooth's built-in SBC audio codec. Audio is transmitted from your iPhone to the E10 via a Bluetooth Low Energy link, which explains the lower fidelity and less reliable wireless connection. This affects music streaming as well as phone calls from the iPhone.  I need to hold the iPhone in front and close to my chest for streaming to work properly. Hopefully these issues can be resolved with future software updates.These reasonably priced OTC devices are usually not covered by insurance. However, I found an available benefit thru my vision plan (VSP) - TruHearing provides substantial discounted prices on such devices.Thanks,"
20,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,best for mild hearing loss; bluetooth only functional for i0S; charging is delicate,"I had mixed feelings about these OTC hearing aids. I do like the earbud like design. There are different tips to suit different ear shapes. They are light and pretty comfortable when wearing but by the end of the day not so much. The app works well, and I like that you can make customizations to them to better suit the user. These are rechargeable which I appreciated. I have had other OTC aids where I had to replace batteries every day which wasn't ideal. Unfortunately, the charging is a bit iffy on these. The earbuds don't seem to seat properly in the case so you may or may not be successful in charging them if you aren't careful. Even if you knock the case its best to check them and make sure they are seated properly. I do feel these are better for mild hearing loss rather than moderate because they seem to amplify more than anything else. I was also disappointing that they Bluetooth feature only works with iOS. Overall, these OTC hearing aids have potential, but they could use several improvements."
20,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Results may vary- find out what caused hearing loss before buying,"Good for some who do not have moderate to severe hearing loss. My husband has severe loss in one ear and these just don’t work as well if hearing is not similar in both ears. He was disappointed. Set up was harder than it should be, people who are not tech savvy will need assistance.Now- these are going to work for some people but here’s the thing. Find out before you invest in something like this what is causing your hearing loss- without a chat with an audiologist, it's like taking a wild guess at what your ears need. Meeting with the pros helps figure out the real cause of your hearing loss, and then you can decide if prescription or OTC hearing aids are right for you. Some private practice doctors with audiologist on staff will be hard selling their hearing aids as it is how they make most of their money and will veto the idea. Get a few opinions."
20,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,I lost one of my hearing aids and I got these as a replacement.,"These worked really well most of the time.  Every once in a while they would cut out and I never could figure out what was causing it.  For the most part, they were a decent replacement.  They fit in my ear and were comfortable.  The sound quality was good (when it wasn't cutting out) and they would stay charged all day.  I think the price tag on these is too high.  I would have never paid that much for them.  I know that good hearing aids aren't cheap, but I think there was a lot of room for improvement with these."
20,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Helps immensely,These Sony CRE-E10 Self-Fitting OTC Hearing Aid help me hear so much better. I didn't realize how much hearing I had lost until I tried these out. I'm only 55 years old and wasn't ready to go to the audiologist just yet. These are a great beginner set.
20,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,converted a stubborn old man!,"my parents live with us (generational household) and my dad has been slowly losing his hearing for years. Keeps the tv at insane volumes, you have to scream for him to hear you when talking. It was becoming a problem. He would often misunderstand things. He always refused that it was that bad and did not want hearing aids. Well, I had finally had enough. I ordered these and told him had to wear them!He said that those type of things hurt his ears and were very uncomfortable for him. I said that he hasn't tried something in years and technology has improved vastly and he needs to just try them!! So he gave it a shot. We can't be more grateful that he did. It was good that they came with different size ear buds. I think his problem was that ones he tried in the past were too big for his ears and he couldn't wear them for more than an hour. I said he could start slow- with and hour or two a day, but he has been wearing them almost all day with no complaints!! We set them up on the iPhone pretty easily. The app is simple enough for him to understand.  He can hear! The TV is no longer blaring and we can have normal conversations.He loves that they connect to his phone and he can take calls and hear audio through them. The battery life is great.Now, they are not perfect and he does have some interference or noise in the background. I honestly think we just need to make some adjustments- we'll get to that soon. But this has been a game changer for him and whole our family. I feel like he is more included because he can actually hear what is going on and be part of our conversations without everyone having to yell.They are pricey for non-prescription hearing aids, but still much less than going to the doctor to get custom ones. We also didn't want to go through the trouble and expense of the prescription ones if he was not going to wear them! This gives me hope that he would be willing to try that next. If you can afford these and need hearing aids I think they are a great option."
20,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Little Pricy,…… But Work!","Not cheap by any means, but comfortable and work! Ability to adjust through online app is awesome!"
20,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,WOW,I slowly lost partial hearing and it upset my family. I bought NuHeara IQbuds2 Max but they really only amplified sound. At a restaurant I could hear the guys in the kitchen as well as friends at the table. I read about Sony OTC aids and decided to try the Bluetooth E10. They are so much better than expected and easy to set up. These are worth the money.
20,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Broken set-up process,"The set up process worked in only the left ear but not the right. Since the set up process insists on you setting up both devices as a pair and always the left first, I had to set up the left three times before I gave up on the right. How stupid!Sony PLEASE have these hearing aids be able to be set up independently of each other and then AT LEAST you could use ONE while the other is being troubleshot.AND NOW both sides won't connect to do setup. Meanwhile the default profile is so off that speech that I need to hear boosted is not at all boosted, but all the high frequency sounds I don't need are boosted to the max. This is great if you want to be distracted by breathing, house flies and spiders stomping around the room and fabric swishing any time you move.And of course customer support is closed until my work day starts."
20,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Poor sound quality.,"I really wanted these hearing aids to work.  I did a lot of research and read many wonderful reviews of these.  The reality has been very disappointing!  They charged effortlessly, they connected with my cell phone instantly and the software app worked well.  However, the sound quality is extremely poor.  I tried endless tweeks with the software and even purchased alternate sleeves for the ear pieces.  Nothing improved the weird robotic tone of voices and the over emphasis of very high frequencies.  I found the unnatural sound quality a deal breaker.  They are promoted as having sound quality comparable to prescription hearing aids.  If this is as good as it gets, then all who have some level of hearing loss are out of luck."
20,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Amazon is keeping my money from me.,DO NOT BUY THESE. They stopped working a week in. And Amazon has made me wait 3 weeks so far and still hasn’t issued my refund. Trust me it’s not worth it. I’m canceling prime and never buying anything from Amazon ever again. You’ve been warned
20,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These OTC hearing aids are Sony, and work great.","These Sony OTC hearing aids are expensive, but.  They are easy to set up, hearing test is easy, App works great, and getting used to wearing them.  There are some situations where I need them, and some times it's best not to wear them."
20,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,50/50 keep vs return!!!!,Very slow imperfect charging system
20,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,The product works better than expected.,I liked everything. There are no dislikes.
20,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Charing Station Failed Twice - Good Service, but Bad Quality","I bought my CRE-E10 hearing aides in October 2023 and the charging station died within a month or so. It took until February of 2024 to get a replacement. That replacement charging station died within 30 days as well. I really like the hearing aides, but this is an unforgivable techcnical issue."
20,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,DO NOT BUY - Cannot complete setup process,I cannot get these hearing aids setup on an iPhone.  They are totally useless without a smartphone.
20,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Gift,"Bought for my sister, her expensive pair were chewed up by her dog.The aids have made a BIG difference in her ability to hear…"
20,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Finally found something that works,"I've been trying different devices for that past few years and up until now they were all miserable failures.  I tried several cheap ones, a few expensive ones (e.g.: eargo) and a smattering in between.  I've learned to be really careful about unpacking because up until this one, I'd sent them all back.  These actually work and I have to say they're pretty amazing.  Before these, everything else I tried either didn't work at all in helping me hear, or they amplified the sounds I didn't want or any number of other issues that made them untenable.  Great product.  I'm really happy with them."
20,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Sony hearing aid,"Set up this gadget is the nightmare i never seen anything like this in my life,after 2days of trying i got nowhere,high pitch voice you can’t adjust sound like amplifying sounds,sorry this is my opinion"
20,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,I Love These  Sony Hearing Aids!,"I have never needed hearing aids before. They are rechargeable, look like ear buds for music, and have a small carry case that is also where you recharge them. One can aim the optimal direction via the phone app. The volume is in the phone app. All kinds of good things are in the app. The charge lasts longer than I expected. A great value for the money."
20,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Poor quality,"I have it for a few months. It never worked: the reason is it never charged properly. On one or two occasion I could use it and the earbuds function, but I can’t tell if it is useful. It took me a while to realize that 1) the earbuds rarely chargee both (see picture). The contact with the hub is very unstable. 2) the hub discharge quickly. So don’t count on it if you haven’t charged the hub and verify that both earbuds are charged. Of course no guaranty past 30 days.Lesson learned: Sony can sell crap."
20,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Hearing Aids,Great product! Excellent for people with mild hearing loss.
20,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Right ear hearing aid problem in charging,Right ear hearing aid that I recently purchased often does not charge even when placed in the case. The left ear hearing aid charges without any issues. I would like to request a replacement. Please provide detailed instructions on how to proceed. I checked Amazon and Sony’s apps and websites but couldn’t find clear information.
20,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Newly received, but so far it performs as advertised.",The setup is simple and the self hearing test does it all. One recommendation for the Sony App though. Please update the app to allow the use of the left and right ear balance adjustment in the remote control.  Otherwise the user has to go through the setup again to get to it. My ear balance can change from day to day.
20,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Loud and clear,Amplifies the sounds and also works as earbuds!
20,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"At last, hearing device that works great","I have tried multiple ways to improve my hearing but nothing has worked like these. Clear conversations but little background noise. Dialogue on TV is perfect, much less dependent on subtitles. They are comfortable for all day wear and charge overnight wirelessly. A great product, not cheap but you get what you pay for."
20,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Work well,Positive step in Design
20,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Difficult to set-up.,"Sony CRE-E10 Seem like they will help. The problem is the set-up. I spent more time than is reasonable trying to get the Sony App to function. Going through all the online support and calling Customer Service.I finally have to return the Hearing Aids because the return time is running out and I've been unable to try them, and can't reach anyone to extend the trial time. Perhaps I'll try a different retailer."
20,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,These are a total scam,"You can’t get these paired, set-up, or in to a usable format until you contact them and they’re only open m-f for help.  They don’t work and they are a waste of money."
20,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Definitely don’t buy!!,"These are cheaply made, you’re only paying for the name. They are no better than cheap amplifying hearing aids. You can hear well in them they have a lot of static and noise. Also BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU BUY, they charged me almost $300 when I returned these. Terrible seller 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻"
20,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Bluetooth connection,"Would not connect to my android phone. Even after an hour with customer service, it was a no go....I have owned several hearing aids, some much less than 1400.00 and had no problems connecting. Maybe Sony puts more effort into their friends at Apple."
20,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Bogus,"Worked for one day, then would not charge, turn on/off or pair.  Returning"
20,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Irritating noise,Junk. Don't waste your money.Irritating squeaky sound sounds.  Amazon may. Not give u a refund. A partial refund at best.Horrible product. Amazon service stinks now a days.Lucky u will ever get your money back. They say 1 month from the day u dropped off. Keep waiting. Addendum. I don't think you will get your money EVER  BAD IDEAi just got an email from Amazon. they gave me the full refund.
20,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Terrible. Don't waste you time.,I'd rather not hear then wear these. The sound was terrible. Expected more from Sony.
20,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Better than most but not perfect,"Although I did not by these from Amazon I do own a pair which cost me about $200 more. The set up is easy to get through if you have a mild to moderate loss of hearing but for profound loss see a doctor or audiologist. Be advised these are NOT compatible with Android for Bluetooth and not sure why Sony did that.My biggest issue with these is the charger. Once placed in the charger one has to ""adjust"" and fiddle around with the aids to get a solid charging connection. It is most annoying! I've pointed this out to the company I bought these from in the hopes they would consult with Sony but to no avail. It is definitely  a design flaw as I've had two sets that do the same thing. The programs are not great as you just get directional hearing at adjustment but should suffice for moderate loss.All is all Ill give them a 7.Good luck!!"
20,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Unreliable charging fixed.,"Purchased these from Sony. Charging the first pair was unreliable. Getting each of them to settle into the case in just the right position to have charging start took increasing amounts of repositioning, despite to built-in magnets that are supposed to make that easy. Wiping contacts with microfiber cloth did not help. After long session with tech support, they had me exchange for an entirely new set. When the second set began to do the same thing, I wondered if the connection could be improved. I tried cleaning the contacts (on hearing aid body and in the charging case) with electrical contact cleaning solution. After that, charging starting working on first or second placement into the case. I switched to using individually packaged alcohol wipes, which worked just as well (and are cheaper as well as easier to travel with). Typically need to use the wipes several times per week. Big relief to find this works.The units fit my ears very well and are comfortable all day long. That is remarkable since most smart phone earbuds simply fall out of my ears. The hearing improvement matches what I had in the past with $6k prescription hearing aids. Glad to have these, especially after figuring out the charging issue."
20,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,I hadn't realized how bad my hearing had gotten until I could hear,"I am amazed at how well these work. And I hadn't realized how much I was missing. I do a lot of events with huge crowds of 10,000 people or more. There is always background noise you get with so many people. The noise cancelling function brought it down to something bearable that allowed me to hear conversations. And I could! I was able to have conversations , even when there was someone else having a conversation next to me. These are kind of life changing. I can actually participate, rather than sit in an auditory well where it is just too much effort to keep up. I do wish they were also available in a lighter color, but they really aren't very visible. They don't fall out, and they are very comfortable. The charge lasts a very long day - over 12 hours. You can control and fine tune settings with the app, but after I did the hearing test I haven't had to change a thing. Worth every penny."
20,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,FINALLY!!! A hearing aid with noise cancellation that works! Love them,These are a real game changer for noisy environments. I no longer have to struggle to hear a dinner conversation in a restaurant with background noise. No more feeling left out of conversations because I just couldn't quite make out the words. These Sony CRE-E10 Self-Fitting OTC Hearing Aids are easily 10 times more effective a hearing conversations in noisy environments than my previous professionally fitted Costco hearing aids. Night and day - no comparison.The only downside is streaming music from Pandora on my IPhone could have a little fuller sound.
20,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,Hard to customize to individual needs,"Manual in tiny print, vague instructions for us who are not totally comfortable with iPhone features. I eventually got to the ""fine tune"" app only to it locking up the next day. Sadly, and surprisingly, Sony help line was hopeless unless you are a tech whiz. Doesn't  Sony realize  that their customers are primarily older adults? Who knows, maybe it's a good hearing aid.Now the return: due to batteries, can't use the local Kohl's. So now more vague instruction from Amazon to ship via UPS. WTF?"
20,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Life changing!,"I have Ménières disease! These are by far the best hearing aids I have used so far. I have tried just about all of them. Bose comes close, but these are truly life changing. If you suffer from normal hearing loss, you will really love these. They are easy to set up and are amazing with your I-phone. The adjust-ability of these hearing aids are incredible. these hearing aids actually give you a self hearing test and adjust to your needs automatically, then you can fine tune any way you want from then on. (I know I sound like I'm being paid for this review. The simple fact is, I've never wrote a review before. I'm doing this for hearing loss sufferers out there. The general public has no idea how disabling hearing loss can be.)"
20,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent hearing aids,"These hearing aids easily compete and even exceed my expectations compared to hearing aids that cost as much as $6000. The noise cancellation actually seems superior, and the hearing test via app while wearing the aids is outrageously simple and effective. They are comfortable to wear, even while driving or walking in wind or on gravel. And the cost is actually realistic for many more people than what is available through audiologists and hearing centers. Until the USA healthcare system ever responds adequately to people with sensory and dental issues, this looks like the way to go. I think they will only get better with more people providing feedback and validating the commercial investment by Sony. Way to go and thanks for these awesome aids!"
20,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing,I have moderate hearing loss and have used Lively behind the ear hearing aids for 3 years. They really did not perform well especially in noisy environments. I decided to give the Sony CRE-E10 a try with the understanding I could return them if not impressed.  I am very impressed. The full range of audio and background noise cancelation are fantastic. The fit is ideal. Streaming works well and you can adjust the mix of live and streamed audio.If you have or think you have a hearing loss I strongly recommend you try the Sony CRE-E10 OTC hearing aids. If they don’t impress you just return them. I’m keeping mine and will probably get a backup pair in case I lose one. Nice one Sony.
20,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Better than nothing…,Bought for my husband as a backup to his Beltone “real” hearing aids. They are just ok as a backup but definitely not a replacement for ones which you get tested and fitted.
20,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,As good as prescription,I’ve had Phonak and these are just as good for a fraction of the cost. Only issue is they are sometimes a hassle to fit in the charger.
20,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Nice,So I purchased them and returned them. I’m hoping there might be a rebate. So I may purchase again and keep this time out.
20,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,My main problem is my itchy ear canal.,I do get some improvement in my hearing when there's other noises around and I'm listening to a friend speaking especially a woman. So it seems to have been able to do its job. Finally I figured out some of that anti-itch cream that I buy in the grocery store for $3 on the end of a q-tip in my ear canal solves the itching problem. I just have to remember to carry extra q-tips and a tube of anti-itch cream around with me.
20,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Works for some,"Helped in some aspects, but would get echoing while talking, unless it was turned down or focus was greatly narrowed. Returned for refund and will try other OTC aids."
20,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are great!,"The first set of hearing aids I bought were the ""very cheap"" ones for about $120. They worked well enough I thought and made it so I could hear things and basically left it at that. For Xmas this year my family bought me a nicer pair than what I had for $500. I noticed right away a difference but they weren't really loud enough and would squeal easily. Then my dog ate one of them forcing me to have to get another set. I decided to do more research and ended up deciding to spend the money, $1300, on these hearing aids. They are just fantastic. The noise cancelling is really smart and doesn't get rid of sounds I want to hear and amplifies perfectly what I do want to hear. The hearing test it gives you really seems to fine tune them exactly to what works best for me. I can't recommend these enough."
20,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Returning item is a problem.,"I ordered these $998.00 hearing aid devices because they were made by Sony. They worked for a few days and then quit. Batteries did not hold a charge. 5 to 6 hours instead of 24.  Occasionally one would not charge at all. I contacted the Sony customer service and after going through the complete trouble shooting process with an automated system. Was transferred to human customer service individual, after their apparent review of the automated transcript, decided they needed to be returned. They required a lot of information to get the return authorized and issued me a Sony CASE #09699831. A lot of information was  required in  order to get them returned. There was to be replacement devices sent  and a return authorization and Prepaid return shipping label supplied. Hasn't happened yet, that was to be here by Friday 6/28/24. They were very adamant that if I did not return the replacement item promptly there would be another $998.00 charged to my account.  If there is not a satisfactory process happening soon I am going to be forced to contact my credit card company and let them address the existing charge which they do quite well."
20,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Beyond happy,"I started using hearing aids 3 years ago, that’s when I finally accepted I had hearing loss. I went to get a hearing test and OMG I had lost 50% on one ear and 60% on the other. When I heard this, I thought I was going to end up deaf. I was prescribed some hearing aids which did help a little until one damaged and I didn’t have the money to fix it since they’re supper expensive. I finally decided to buy an OTC Hearing aids and oh boy, I will never regret choosing these. I have a big head ache right now because I hear so many noises I wouldn’t listen to before not even with the expensive Hearing AidsThe awesome part is that they come with a hearing test as you activate them on your phone, and wow, i have to lower tv, radio and my phone because of how clear and loud all sounds.I couldn’t wait to write this review so I can tell everyone how great these are and to help them make up there mind on these. You won’t regret it.The only bad thing is that the app will not work on an old iPhone. I have I phone 11 and there’s no app for this phone. I had to set them up on my husbands phone."
20,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for mild hearing loss,"I have issues in places with a lot of ambient noise especially in trying to carry on a conversation (crowds, restaurants, etc…).These are perfect, set up was easy on my iPhone, they are comfortable and customizable.  I own a dog grooming business and the back round noise can be overwhelming between barking dogs, multiple commercial blow dryers and ringing phones, these aids have made a significant difference in my ability to hear conversations. They can be customized to prioritize direction so that it’s easier to hear the person speaking from in front of you, and back round noise behind you is less intrusive.  I noted on one review that someone stated that the hearing aids do not work for phone calls because they do not have microphones, this is not true. I take calls on them all the time, they work great. The sound quality for streaming music is not good, but I don’t see that as being important."
20,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sony Hearing Aids,"These Sony hearing aids are by far the best out there when it comes to otc hearing devices .  I bought 4 or 4 cheaper brands and they were all a little help but just didn’t deliver good quality sound . I can wear the Sony buds and hear what everyone in the lunch room at work is saying .The fit is outstanding ? These will not fall out , they give you a pack of cones so you will find what fits your ears no problem .They may seem expensive to you but if you get regular hearing aids you’ll spend 3 or 4 ,000.00 dollers which make the Sony hearing aids a great deal and you can return them if your not happy . But I’m sure you will be very happy with them .I can turn the tv volume way way down . Comfort is amazing , I can’t tell I’m wearing them except for the fact I can hear . My hearing is really bad and and with the Sony hearing aids I hear everything , woo hoo , thank you Sony !"
20,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works Well with good iPhone Bluetooth Features,"I have been experiencing hearing loss and decided to give OTC hearing aids a try.  I purchased what seemed to be a popular quality pair for about $200, but they didn't seem to help that much and were complicated to adjust.  After reading all the reviews I decided to go for the Sony E10 hearing aids.  On first try, I immediately noticed an improvement in hearing without any issues of noise, echos or popping.  What really rounds out the product is the Bluetooth connection to the iPhone.  The Sony app gives the ability to adjust the hearing aids to best meet your needs.  But what was great was how the control of the hearing aids are integrated into the iPhone control panel and even home screen, for easy adjustment of microphone volume on the fly.  The sound quality for listening to music is not as good as quality ear buds.  But these will be a life-saver that I can rely on when really needed."
20,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,The most confusing review you'll likely read,"I love these hearing aids!  I hate these hearing aids!Why are both of those statements true?  The performance of these hearing aids is perfect when they have had a full charge the night before and they are in your ears.  However, getting a full perfect charge is almost impossible because they have not chosen to use magnetism to secure the hearing aids in the charger.  You have to fiddle with the hearing aids when putting them in the charger ad infinitum until they both finally show that they are charging.  Even after you do that, however, doesn't mean that they will maintain that status all night while they charge.  I have had them show fully charged green and yet, when I put them in my ears one or the other are not fully charged and they actually fail to initialize.  At that point, they are essentially ear plugs!These hearing aids would be a five star if Sony used magnetism to seat the hearing aids in the charger like 95% of ear buds do."
20,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very glad I purchased these,"I have had resound hearing aids for four years. They were very, very good because they were $4000 a pair; however, the last pair, when I wore my glasses or even had my hair cut short, produced an enormous amount of scratchy sound from the earpieces of my glasses and just my hair. So I thought hey, over-the-counter hearing aids oh my God Sony make some. All of my audio gear has been Sony for 40 years. I can tell you these are terrific. They work just as well as my 4 X cost resound. Plus, the audio of the Bluetooth playing books or music is 10 times better. Go for it."
20,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,These really work !,"Although not perfect, these over-the-counter hearing aides are pretty good. The customer service from Sony was excellent, and although these are expensive, they work much better than other lower cost ones that I have had to return."
20,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,"sound quality (discrimination ), poor",poor sound quality
20,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth the money,"These are absolute nightmare. They barely work, I always have to revise the settings and they are uncomfortable. Do not purchase."
20,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,These really work for me,"I had tried cheap amplifiers before, to no real benefit. These Sony's have markedly improved my life.I wish the smaller version had rechargeable batteries, but I am more than happy to deal with these."
20,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Beta?  Not ready for commercial distribution,"Like – out of the box, they had a nice sound.Dislike – after several days, many hours, and two Contacts with customer support, I am giving up. The specific symptom is that I could only get one earbud to connect Bluetooth at a time. Customer support did give me some good information that, I think, should’ve been on a “getting started” page or in the small manual. But about all they could suggest is reboot, or uninstall and reinstall.  so I was never able to connect the Sony software.these hearing aids are recommended by several sources, so I am very disappointed. If you decide to give them a try I hope you have better luck."
20,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Failed after 6 months,"Thinking that Sony's reputation for excellent audio equipment would extend to the CRE-E10 Self-Fitting OTC Hearing Aid.They lasted just six months before one suddenly failed. The left earpiece is still working but the right ear just stopped working.  I don't know why. I wear them during the day, clean and charge them every night, when one ear piece failed. It was acting strange for a few days, you could not hear and then the sound would pop back. Now it is useless.What an expensive disappointment.Richard Borreca"
20,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice hearing aid.,I like how they fit into my ears.
20,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Life changing,"Very pleased with the quality, look and comfort of the ear buds. Hearing things clearly for the first time in years."
20,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Easy to insert; quality sound,Stays in place;Adjusts easily with android;Directional sound pick up;Overpriced??Good reviews;Long lasting???time will tell;
20,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,,Mi mamá ya casi no escucha pero con estos audífonos alcanza a escuchar algo
20,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Right earbud was defective,"For 1200 dollars, my expectations for a Sony product were high. unfortunately, the right earbud took an excessive time to charge and once in, did not react to the hearing test.  Just annoying static.  The left bud was great and could see the benefit.  For the expense, Probably not best to buy this online.  I have never had an issue with Sony products in 30 years so who knows where these came from or if they were a prior issue.  Going back immediately."
20,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,AMAZING QUALITY SOUND,"The Sony CRE-E10 Self-Fitting OTC Hearing Aids are perfect for individuals experiencing mild to moderate hearing loss, allowing them to enhance their hearing without the need for a visit to an audiologist. These hearing aids are crafted to empower users with the ability to fine-tune their hearing experience on their own, providing both convenience and confidence in their daily interactions."
20,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Pretty good, not great. Will not charge!","Sound quality is pretty good unless you want to listen to music, then they are definitely lacking. The aids will not connect to the charging case most of the time. When I wake up the right one is constantly dead even though it’s been in the case and plugged in all night. The app resets the remote settings every time you charge the aids. Constantly having to reset the directional sound, volume, and treble/bass is annoying. May have to exchange them and see if the next pair connects to the charger better."
20,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,these HA's are weak amplifiers,I had to return these hearing aids because they were not strong enough to amplify sounds for me.I consider myself to be mild to moderate hearing impairment. to give you an idea where am I hearing deficit is I can usually speak to people without hearing aids if they're looking directly at me and they're speaking at a decent tone of volume not raise volume.oddly the smaller hearing aid completely in canal Sony work better for me and amplify more than these do.
20,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent hearing aid, but it doesn't stream from Android phone or Windows computer","The initial calibration hearing test was easy to do and produced a very good match to my hearing needs: I liked the sound. Not too tiny, not annoying wrapping or clicking sounds, not too loud, not too soft. Very natural sound, even in noisy environments. It was easy to insert in my ears, and they stayed in place easily, without discomfort. They look very natural, like a pair of earbuds. In many ways it was the perfect hearing aids for me. BUT I found to my surprise after buying that they only stream from iPhones or other Apple devices. I use Android phone and Windows computer, like 75% of phone/computer users. That was a deal breaker for me, unfortunately. I will have to continue looking and will now be sure to not be fooled by the description ""iPhone and Android"" compatible, when what is meant is that the app for managing the hearing aids can be installed in both systems. I think the listing should state more clearly that these hearing aids don't stream from Android or non-Apple devices."
20,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sony CRE-E10 Hearing Aid - WORKS EXTREMELY WELL - I JUST ORDERED ONE FOR MY WIFE!,"I have been looking for a hearing aid for a couple of years. Not wanting to pay $3,000 to $5,000+ for a hearing aid, I tried three that cost less than $100. They worked - as AMPLIFIERS. ALL of the noise, along with other sounds, were amplified to the same level, making them completely useless. The sounds were loud, but I could not understand what was being said. This didn't surprise me, because I knew enough from previous electronics audio design work, along with my ham radio experience, to understand what was needed. I can picture the engineers at many companies, that can design an amplifier, but not understand the compression, quieting, and band shaping required to design a good hearing aid. The engineers at the high-end hearing aid companies certainly know what to do, but I didn't want to pay the money asked for their fine products. Who else could understand the requirements? An audio-video company. I started searching, and found Sony, one of the world leaders in fine audio equipment.I would only buy the streaming version -E10 for a few hundred dollars more. We have so many products, primarily Apple, that I could not function well without automatic streaming from my iPhone, iPads, TVs, computers, and other devices. These hearing aids work flawlessly. I was supposed to take a hearing test using Sony's app, but I didn't bother. I use my iPhone's Settings, Accessibility, etc. and control all functions with my iPhone. If you don't take the hearing test, you are limited to the ""Universal"" band-shaping, but it works well for me. What would I improve? I listen to music and video most of the day using my Apple AirPods Pro, and Bose 700 headphones - both active noise cancelling. I can stream to the Sony CRE-E10, but (Duh!) there isn't much bass, not needed in a hearing aid."
20,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,App  Apocalypse,Sony is more interested in getting information about you than supporting their own product. The CRE-E10 hearing aids work right out of the box. The app or the Sony web site however do not work.  Unless of course you are a masochist and enjoy being tortured by links that go where and a website that seems to be designed to be non functional. Five Stars for the hardware and One Star for the pathetic app and website.
20,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Easy start up, high quality","I have tried the 5k, 6k and 7k hearing aids through an audiologist, including both in-ear and over-the-ear styles.  They were all excellent, but I didn't feel they were great enough to justify the cost.  Still needing hearing aids, I went with two over-the-counter aids over the course of four years.  Both sets died after two years.  Both were basically the same, volume control and four pre-programmed modes.  They were OK enough to justify $300/set, but I was always worried about one falling out (they were over the ear), and the vendors wanted ridiculous money to replace the ear cups ($30).  The second pair stopped working this week, so I ordered the Sony hearing aids.  These aids are a terrific product.  I don't even know I'm wearing them because they are so comfortable.  Setup took a few minutes to test each ear and program them via the Sony app.  For the initial charge, buyers should be aware that there are three yellow/green charging lights on the front of the storage case, one for each aid, and one for the case itself.  Initially I thought there was only one light, so they were undercharged when I used them the first time.  The storage case can act as a charger, even without a connection, and that's the purpose of the center yellow/green light, to let you know when the case has enough juice to charge the hearing aids.  Each aid has its own light to let you know when they're fully charged.  I have an android phone, so the iOS streaming doesn't matter in my situation."
20,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Bluetooth enabled hearing aids I’ve had,"I have tinnitus and mild hearing loss and these have been the most comfortable and reliable I have had so far (only had a month or so, so will update if any issues). The app works great and the Bluetooth connection is the most reliable and stable I’ve had yet. I typically use my iPhone to stream masking noises which work so great and is automatic with putting them on. Only bad thing there is that I do not believe they can stream music/white noise/etc… with android phones (at least at the time I am writing this Apr 2024). Battery lasts all day even with using streaming feature for tinnitus masking sounds all day. Happy I purchased these."
20,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,They are ok if you just want to amplify sounds,"I received these as a gift and after trying hard for about six weeks I had to go back to my traditional hearing aids. These seem to be more about amplifying all sounds which really doesn't help - for example: when we are in the car with AC turned on, the sound of air coming out of the vents is louder and makes it difficult to hear the person I'm sitting right next to. Same thing in restaurants. My traditional hearing aids filter that kind of noise out so is not an issue.Battery life - it is challenging to get them to charge. Too many times I put them in the charging case only to find them both dead the next morning. Putting them in and getting the indicator lights to come on is like Rubik's cube and it just isn't worth the gamble when I need to have them ready to go for work the next day."
20,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Charging finicky,"Love the sound quality, but I keep having issues where one aid will not charge,  thinking of returning."
20,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not Quite There Yet,"I bought the Sony CRE-E10 because I fit the profile (slight to moderate hearing loss, confirmed by an audiologist). Previously I'd had several versions of Eargos, which generally worked well. However, the latest Eargos, version 7, were slightly smaller than previous versions and ""floated"" in the ear canal causing extreme itching, so I returned them. They also seemed quite expensive at well over $2k -- far more than other OTC aids.My experience with the Sony CRE-E10 was generally good. Setup was easy (although I'm 80 I'm pretty good with technology) and I especially liked the ""fine tune"" option following app setup. They were comfortable to wear, and I bought a set of vented ""click sleeves"" which resolved the occlusion issue. I did  like the Sony hearing app, which let me set the directionality of the microphones among many other functions.The problem was that after about 10 days of use the right earbud stopped working. I followed all the trouble-shooting suggestions, made sure it was charged, etc, but nothing helped. I didn't want to start calling customer support and dealing with that so I took the easy way out. As I was well within the 30-day return window, I simply returned them for a refund. That said, I might give them another try at a later date, but if I do I will probably buy them direct from Sony who offer a longer return window.As an aside, I have the latest and greatest version of Apple Airpods Pro 2 and I have to say that at $199 they offer many of the same benefits of the Sony Sony CRE-E10 at $1200, such as far better streaming quality and hands free iPhone use (the Sonys stream from the iPhone but you must speak through the iPhone's microphone). I do wish that Apple had a dedicated Airpod app so all its many functions could be managed in one place. That said, I'll be using the Airpods for the foreseeable future."
20,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Ambivalent so I am sending back.,"Have had these a week and adjusted them innumerable times, but can’t say there was any eureka moment.I live on 82 acres and other than the occasional vehicle, not much sound other than the breeze in the trees and bird contact notes, although the latter are great after not hearing them for years.Found the aids are not for running in, although who needs them for that, as I was walking in the field and the right aid fell out into the grass. Had the wife out helping search, but the dogs came over and I said “find.” Ten seconds later the female picked it up and handed it to me. The moral is let your dogs sniff them lest you lose one.The downside to these is that while they have a web site and you can call Sony, the only instructions included are about pairing them and putting them in place. After that you are on your own. There really should be tips on how to achieve this level or that direction or that tone. After your test you are to balance the hearing. I could only find this by streaming some music, then going back to the balancing, then back and forth.As for the hearing they do bring in the pitches you are probably missing. Not as accurate as an audiologist test, but I am no where near an audiologist.I suffer from 32 years of tinnitus. Sony states these don’t deal with that, but all any hearing aid does is mask the sound with another. These can do that in a noisy environment or when downloading the OTO app from the Apple Store. You can stream any of about 25 sounds at a preferred level. I chose violet color.I see comments regarding these not giving a great streaming sound, but that is not what they are for, and then I wonder if the filtering for say high tones affects the treble sounds over the bass. Don’t know.All in all, I have four weeks. We shall see.Gave it a three week try. The chirping and clicking got tiring.  Does not help my hearing that much. The high notes I had lost come in with running water, walking on gravel and the like and are quite annoying.Sent it back. I do not recommend."
20,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Better than most OTC hearing aids - Better than behind the ear units by far.,"I have spent thousands on ""professional"" hearing aids. Every one of them had some major shortcoming.Behind the ear devices pick up more noise from behind than you want to listen to.  Been looking for a system that actually uses the ear for picking up sound and transferring it to the canal.  These Sony units certainly have fit the bill.  A bit pricey, but they seem to work very well.  I would have rated them higher, but the app could certainly be better.  Additionally, the app uses ultrasound to communicate with the devices so there is no Bluetooth connectivity. There is also no real phone connection, so transitioning from a BT device to these will take some getting used to.  You CANNOT answer your phone through these units, but you can hear the phone's speaker while putting it up against your ear.  Not terrible but it will take some getting used to.  All around, I am satisfied with these hearing aids even without the improvements that the devices could use."
20,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,They work - but could be better,"I’m a 34 year old male that woke up in the ER with multi major organ failure and “sudden deafness” in both ears. I was told I have profound hearing loss by the doctors in the hospital. As my hearing got slightly better and transitioned to mild/ moderately severe hearing loss, I decided to order these hearing aids. They were easy to set up as I’m tech savvy. But if you’re not then these headphones can be trying for you. The program/app from Sony is pretty seamless but extensive as they do a hearing test in the app. Once that was set up I was able to hear people speak but they sounded very tinny, kind of like chipmunks. This was the reason for my return. Everyone’s situation and hearing loss may be different. These hearing aids work well, but they weren’t for me. The quality of sound was too close to the live listen feature that I use on my AirPod Pro 2 headphones for me to keep such a large investment purchase. As my hearing returns with medication and procedures, I hope to fully regain and recover my hearing."
20,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,More Pros Than Cons,"I'm a long-time hearing aid user.  When my Widex aids failed after five-years, I purchased top-of-the-line OTC Eargo hearing aids which, despite great features, have proven to be unreliable.  When my Eargo 6 devices failed for the third time, I decided to try these Sony hearing aids.  So far so good.I've owned my Sony devices for three monthsProsVery good audio quality, as would be expected from SonyIn-the-ear earbud form factor is reasonably confortable to wearProgramed to match individual hearing lossSmartphone app works well to adjust for different environmentsFront and rear facing microphones can be adjusted to supress rear background noise.Good for carrying on a conversation with someone in a noisy environmentRechargable batteries with long battery life on a single chargeShort recharge timeGood value for the moneyReliable (so far)ConsNon-hear-thru design blocks off most natural hearingIn-the-ear earbud form factor is very visibleAudio/Call streaming only available with iPhoneOne year warrantyOne final thought.  I play classical guitar.  Many hearing impaired guitarists, myself included, find their hearing aids distort the sound of their instruments.  Removing our hearing aids while playing seems to be the most common solution.  By turning the volume down with the smartphone app, my Sonys introduce the least impact on the sound of my instruments of any hearing device I've owned."
20,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Uncomfortable for extended wear,"Sony CREE10I have moderate hearing loss and have used BTE hearing aids for 30 years. I bought these so I could periodically dry out my prescription hearing aids and thereby extend their life.My experience with these hearing aids is that the sound is different, but acceptable. My prescription hearing aids clarify speech without increasing background ambient noise. These hearing aids raise the level of the all sound both good and bad, without focusing specifically on speech. That said the noise reduction capability is good. My prescription hearing aids are better at pulling speech out of noisy environments while these hearing aids are better for situations like listening to nature.I found the set up instructions to be confusing. You are bounced between a paper start up card, two apps, and a website all which are somewhat contradictory. All of them fail to clearly explain that you need to connect the hearing aids to the iPhone IOS operating system via settings/accessibility. They should not be connected like a regular Bluetooth device or you shorten the battery life and lose capability. The iPhone accessibility/hearing aid function gives the hearing aids additional capability, such as tinnitus mediation. Because it uses a lower power version of Bluetooth it also lengthens battery life. The iPhone interface is identical to my prescription hearing aids.I use hearing aids for 16 hours a day, every day, and after a couple of days of accommodation I have never found it to be uncomfortable. However, even after two weeks, I could not wear these hearing aids for more than about four hours without them becoming annoying.  The problem is not the domes with are comfortable but rather the body of the hearing aids which are bulky and heavy. I returned the hearing aids because I found them uncomfortable to wear for long periods.I was very disappointed that the refund from Amazon took over two weeks from the time that I returned the hearing aids.."
20,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great, except the Charging Case.","When I was still working, I was an airline pilot for 38 years, flying long haul international routes. As a result of thousands of hours in a whistling aluminum tube I am unable to hear many of the higher frequencies. I finally broke down and got these as I was tired of saying “huh?” all the time. Setup is easy, fine tuning takes awhile as the changes are subtle, but worthwhile. Once I got them setup I was amazed at the number of birds I could hear in my backyard! They won’t turn back the clock 40 years, but they are a vast improvement. As others have noted, they are not AirPod Pros as as far as music is concerned, but they aren’t meant to be. I like the fact that they will play your phone calls in your ears. No microphone, so you talk into the bottom of the phone. That’s fine for me for the occasional call. If I’m making a lot of calls, or extended listening to music, I put in the AirPods. Battery life is as advertised, no problems there. Which brings me to my only point of contention.  The !#@$z% charging case! Some nights it takes 10 minutes to get the hearing aids correctly positioned in the case. The charging ports themselves are extremely small and must be matched up. If you don’t get a yellow flashing light you are not charging. Sometimes you’ll get one set, then putting in the other will bump the first one ever so slightly and you get to start over. Unusually poor design by Sony. I consider myself a patient man, but this sometimes frustrates the hell out of me. All in all, they work well, do what they’re supposed to do, if it wasn’t for that charging case.‘"
20,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Great in all respects except one.,There is no way that I have found that you can reset them unless you put the back in the charging ports. If you lose Bluetooth you cannot reset through the device itself or through the app so unless you carry the charger you are out of commission until you get back home. Serious design flaw.
20,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good Product,"Amazon page indicates in stock. Amazon would not ship to my address so had to use Amazon pick-up counter, some distance to drive. Would not allow my free shipping to Amazon pick-up counter. Shipping indicate $10.61 next day. Trick is, this is from when they are ready to ship. In stock, next day shipping took 8 days to be ready for me to pick-up at Amazon pick-up counter and shipping box was so badly damaged the Sony box practically fell out. Would have given a 5 star if not for all of this. Had them but a few days but I am pleased. Put them on out of the box for a day, worked well. Downloaded the app, tuned them and used them another day or so. Seemed nice but wanted a little more quality. Went back to the app and used the Fine Tune option. Really nice, they work well. Sound quality, noise suppression increased hearing ability is great. May go back and fine tune again as I get more use to wearing them I am catching some things I think the app will make even better. Overall a good buy for the quality. Easy to use right out of the box, easy download of the app and easy programing. Do really wish that more of the available feature worked with my android phone. It would complete the greatness."
20,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Work wonderful with an Iphone.,As hearing aids they are as good as my prescription ones that cost three times as much.They are MFI (Made For Iphone) which means the work perfect with an Iphone but do not connect to other BlueTooth devices.
9,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Don't waste your money,Don't waste your money on these. These are not designed for people with moderate hearing loss. Good luck with programming them. It keeps running into error after error when trying to program them. I'll stick with my behind the ear hearing aids.
9,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love my new Eargos!,"Easy ordering on Amazon, great live and online support, great fit and function... highly recommended."
9,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not for me,"My ear canals are narrow and these devices kept falling out. I would call them ""amplifiers"" not ""hearing aids"". There was no background noise cancellation or bluetooth. Returning them was a monumental hassle. First it's not the standard easy Amazon return - you need to go to the USPS, stand in line, insure it and pay for it. Then, when the refund doesn't come, you call them and the say ""You paid Amazon and you have to get your refund back when Amazon receives them."" Well, why did Eargo send me a return lable with their address? Bless Amazon - I got my money back within hours after I called them."
9,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,easy to use,price  was resonable
9,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Very POOR customer service from Eargo,"If you need to send these back, Eargo keeps your money for several weeks before refunding it, even though they have received the product."
9,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Not visible hearing aids,Excellent sound quality especially in the speech frequencies at a fairly reasonable cost.  The added benefit of no one knowing you are wearing hearing aids.
9,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Never got to use the aids, couldn't get help.","Very poor service , especially after expecting quality from the descriptions of the product."
9,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Eargo 7 - Very pleased,"Generally, the product itself (Eargo 7) has met or exceeded my expectations, I would rate it 8 or 9 on a scale of 10 on how well it helped my hearing, and how satisfied I am with the purchase, only refraining from a 10 because I've never used hearing aids until now, and I have no relative experience with anything else. However, this product seems to be high quality, and good at doing what it's supposed to do. One key thing to understand is that it takes a little bit of adjustment time to get used to 'hearing' again, and get the aids adjusted to your comfort. After a few weeks, I completely forget that they're in.- The customer support resources are really good, with many how-to videos for common questions, etc. I found these very valuable.- The customer service reps, both pre-sale and afterwards, were 'gold standard'. All communications were prompt, and exceeded my expectations. The insurance specialist was particularly persistent in dealing directly with my audiologist. She made numerous calls, and spent substantial time on hold, finally getting the information she needed from the health care provider to confirm and authorize my insurance coverage with my carrier. The customer service experience was a key factor in my decision to proceed with the purchase.- The in-house audiologist that I spoke with 1-on-1 after my purchase was also excellent. I had a problem transferring my 'Sound Match' settings to the charger initially, a Bluetooth issue. She knew of the problem and instructed me on resolving it. She also had a lot of answers to my initial questions about the operation; everything from itchy ears to how to adjust settings. She was excellent.- Perhaps the only very slight negative in my experience was with the Eargo phone app. I found that it wasn't as 'intuitive' as some apps, but as in most software products, once you become familiar with it, it does what it's supposed to do. I had no issues with the ultrasound control whatever. I also noticed recently that an update is coming, so I expect the App will be even better. My 1-on-1 meeting with the Eargo specialist post-purchase was invaluable in respect to this topic."
9,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good Quality for the money,Sound clarity is great. The Eargo7 has less feedback or chirping i call it than the Eargo 6 model. You can really notice the improvement when you are outdoors in the wind. I can honestly say that I forget I am wearing them because they are so comfortable. Thanks for such a great product!
9,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love a hearing ""helper"" to be discreet and Eargo fits the bill.","I am new to hearing ""helpers"" and resisted the over the ear concept as being aging,  I read an  endorsement of Eargos in Wirecutter which I have used for other products and trust them.  In the their review they said that their staff would choose Eargos if they wanted a discreet hearing helper. I ordered them and think that they are a great product. In fact, I was about to get in the shower to wash my hair last week and totally forgot they were in my ear.  The directions and staff are very helpful and supportive with answering any questions I have had. I have no complaints and am 100% satisfied. Patricia"
9,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Eargo,Small in size but great in sound
9,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good alternative,Not for me. Too big for my earholes
9,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Ego hearing aids,"Great sound adjustments, comfortable, don, T get caught in glasses or masks. Phone support and help the best of all. Have been getting traditional aides fr  ooo m VA but these worth paying for"
9,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great,These are better than other hearing aids I have tried before. I particularly like the fact that they are easy to wear and discreetly invisible.
9,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Return policy Eargo,"I bought an Eargo hearing aid  through Amazon. Eargo offers an 45 day trial period, you send it back at end of 45 days if doesn't work for you.  The end of the 45 days was coming up and I called Eargo to find out how to return it.  The representative said that because I had boughten it thiugh Ama zon I had to go with there return which had expired.  No where did amazon or Eargro make this clear. Eargo did not make it clear that if you DID NOT buy the hearing aid from the Eargo company the 45 day trial was void. Neither did Amazon.  Up to this point I had been happy with the customer service, they were very helpful with the hearing aid. One of the main features is having time to get use to the hearing aid and make sure it works for you. I was keeping very close eye on the days I had left.  I think it was very disingenuis of Eargo to  advertise this 45 day free trial and not tell consumers it is only available directly through Eargo. There was no notification to  consumer that if bought through Amazon etc. it's void.Maurine Egan"
9,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product!,The Eargo 7 is an amazing product. I never new how bad my hearing was until I purchased these. I love the fact that you can go into the mobile app and adjust each side separately to your specification. Anyone with hearing problems needs to purchase the Eargo 7. You won’t be disappointed.
9,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Eargo 7,"Bought a set a few weeks ago, I like the small size. So far they have exceeded my expectations, as good as ones by other manufacturers at many times more expensive."
9,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,No more head in a barrel sound,I love these. The speech and sound in the surrounding environment is very clear.  The best part is my voice doesn’t sound as if my hands are covering my ears or my head is stuck in a barrel or box.
9,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Sounds is great when they work,"The sound and clarity is good,When they work. I would return them except I am out of the window of time too. I recommend people not to buy them. one will charge one won't they won't turn on when you take him out of the case you have to put them in and out multiple times! sometimes you have to connect the charger to the case and then take them out for them to turn on multiple problems with them turning on and off paperweight at this point.disappointed."
9,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound quality and fit.,Tried these out to replace my behind the ear kind. Really enjoying them. Only been 2 1/2 weeks but big difference in wind noise and clarity. Love being able to adjust with my phone. Customer service has been awesome also.
9,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent OTC hearing aids,"Eargo 7 reviewI have been wearing the Eargo 7 hearing aids for just over 3 months and so far am very satisfied with the sound and quality of these OTC hearing aids. I have mild to moderate hearing loss and have worn prescribed CIC hearing aids for over 10 years, so I can offer a good comparison between the two options.Sound: The Eargos are my third pair of hearing aids and I find the sound to be as good as the sound from the hearing aids I bought from audiologists (both were high end Phonak brand). Adjusting to new hearing aids can take some time as the sound will seem a bit harsh and unnatural at first as your brain adapts to the sound. After I wore the Eargos for about a month I redid the Sound Match adjustment and have been very happy with the sound since. This is definitely one of the pluses of the Eargos as you can redo the basic Sound Match on your own and if you need help, it is just a phone call away. No need to run to the audiologist and you can repeat each test sound as often as you need to be sure you are hearing it.Comfort: The Eargos are easy to insert and remove. They are not as perfect a fit as my old hearing aids made from a custom mold for my exact ear shape, but they are comfortable and nearly invisible. I prefer the sound with the closed petals (fuller, richer sound) and have persevered through the itchiness (it does get better, but you really have to keep wearing them and deal with the itchiness for a while).Programs: I love that you can set up programs for a variety of hearing situations in these tiny hearing aids. Using ultrasound from your cell phone to do this is genius as most CIC hearing aids can’t be adjusted for different settings. I am using TV, Restaurant and Music and still playing around with the adjustments to find what I like best. At first, I would switch to the TV setting for watching television, but now I find the normal setting works fine for most shows and only switch when there is a lot of background music as in movies. The Restaurant setting is great and really does make conversations in noisy restaurants more enjoyable. I find the Music setting especially good for instrumentals. You can also adjust the volume, treble and base to your liking for each of these programs and enable Sound Adjust+ which I prefer.Care: I have waxy ears and that was a problem with my custom hearing aids as I needed to take them to the audiology office often for a thorough cleaning. The Eargos are so easy to keep clean. I follow the recommended schedule and I bought the deep cleaning kit to start. You can find more alcohol wipes on Amazon for a very reasonable price and you only need a tiny bit of the putty for each deep cleaning.Fit: It takes some experimenting with different sizes and style of petals to find the best fit, but they fit pretty well for something that isn’t customized for your ears. For my right ear, I wish there was a half size between the medium and large closed petals.Case and battery life: Excellent! My Eargos last all day and I can get two days of charging without having to plug the charging case back in for a charge.The one problem I have had with the Eargos is the pull thread and I see others have had the same experience. The pull thread for my right hearing aid has already come off. Fortunately, I can easily remove the hearing aid with out the pull thread (most likely because of the shape of my right ear canal). I will see about warrantee repair service for this when I am back in the US."
9,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Totally satisfied with my purchase,"I know the most helpful reviews here, for me, included the extent of heating loss, lifestyle and expectations. I’m a 66 years old retired farmer with moderate hearing loss (higher frequencies) brought on by heavy equipment use without hearing protection.  I am caretaker of my parents who both have differing levels of hearing loss as well.  I noticed my decline in hearing from having others to repeat themselves in meeting situations, restaurants as well as church settings.Since I have been self-employed my whole life, I have been totally responsible for my own health care and savings acutely aware of costs associated with my own needs.  I have had several appointments with audiologists to ascertain scope and degree of hearing loss over the past several years.  What I have found out is that most audiologists represent specific companies and when I was questioned about preferences as to “type” of hearing device, I was told I needed to make another appointment with that representative.  I have a healthy skepticism of the current corporate health care system we find ourselves in now.  My motto is to not be a “money conduit” and my brain still functions relatively well enough to filter out hype and sales promotions.When I looked around for hearing devices, I found Eargo.  I also found others that were online and direct to the consumer.  I study reviews to see if they “sound” plausible.  I want to hear from the actual purchaser of the product and their honest positives and negatives concerning their purchase.  In that vein, I will proceed.I initially made the purchase for several reasons.  #1 I could purchase on Amazon.  I like Amazon’s return policy, their reviews and the ability to purchase insurance of the product in one place.  #2 The warranty on the Eargo 7’s was 2 years.  #3 Lifetime support and #4 Return policy.I didn’t know if these would work in my situations.  The return policy took that fear out of the equation.After receiving the 7’s I found that the “Sound Match” was fairly simple to complete.  There is some understanding of exactly how the units work, what the Sound Match is calibrating and how the Bluetooth connection between the charger base works when downloading your specific programing for your units.  If you don’t have the technological skill set, they are fairly easy and it should not be a problem in finding someone to help.  Their customer service is VERY helpful in discussing how they work if you cannot understand from the many videos accessible through YouTube.  I had a hesitation in purchasing with the reviews I saw on the app.  I had no problem with it at all once I understood that the app “communicates” with the devices with ultrasound from your cell phone.  I have an iPhone 13.  The volume on the phone should be set at 75% or higher.  Sometimes, I have had to hold closer to one side or the other to get the audible settings right.  They have a “Chat” feature on their app.  I found that to be annoying since there is a delay in their responses.  I don’t have a lot of time to wait 5 min for them to respond so if I have a question, I just call in to support, which has been very helpful in resolving my problems which usually revolve around understand of how the devices work.  I’ll add that during the Sound Match process your hearing needs are transmitted to the company and in my case, it was suggested that I do the Sound Match a second time as the differences between ears was so different.  It turned out that I didn’t do the initial Sound Match correctly.  After the info was transmitted to the support person, she could see that I did it correctly and the devices were updated online.  Simply amazing!Tonal quality seems to be good and you just have to experiment in different setting to see how they will work for you.  My hearing loss is in the higher frequencies, so at first everything sounded “tinny” but as time has gone on, the sounds are more “normal” to me now.  I just seem to hear better which is the goal, isn’t it?  They are comfortable for me to wear but I do not like the solid petals.  They made my ears itch.  The open petals were a much better fit for meI know this is a long review, but I wanted to let you know my total experience so far as I have had them about 30 days now.  The price for them was a little less than ½ of what was attempting to be sold to me when I started this process and I feel like I am more control of the whole process not just the end user who does what they are told.  I hope this helps you make your own decision according to your own needs and comfort level."
9,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent Hearing Aids. Worth every penny,"I have been a fan of Eargo ever since the beginning and have had several pairs or versions as the company learned more about hearing and the technology developed.A month ago I lost my aids. Yikes. So I tried different hearing aids or gizmos from Amazon. Some were very good and inexpensive but were not as easy to operate nor did they have the staff to manage all the questions they got.It comes in a box and there you scan to register your warranty. I love companies that do this. There is a book, petals which is what they call the things on the aid a way to clean it and more.You need to charge for four hours. But then you need to program the aids to your cell phone. I have an iPhone so I can’t discuss androids. This takes about an hour or so there are several steps.I like that each step tells you how long it will last and there is a count down. The app also tells you things.I love how well I hear and how easy it is to connect to Bluetooth. This morning after doing all the steps I put them on. I have a Fire TV and had been watching it without aids. The volume was way up. Now the volume is at 31 and lower depending on what is on and noise in the neighborhood.These are comfortable to wear. They come with two different types of petals and sizes. Try them  Both.About the only thing I don’t like is that even tho I have had them a long time it is always difficult for me to change the petals. Don’t do this when you need them right away.Also note that the company does answer questions but there is often a long time to do this. Thus they put someone in charge for you to call from the company.If I can I will answer questions. But I can’t answer about costs etc."
9,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Eargo 7,"I needed to purchase a set of hearing aids based on my current assignment at my job. I was having trouble hearing people calling out their names and my supervisor was having trouble communicating with me and giving direction. I was reluctant at first based on my experience with prescription hearing aids. I had gone to a reputable audiologist and had an official hearing test performed. The diagnosis was made that I had moderate hearing loss and I was fitted for hearing aids. The hearing aids were behind the ear and were $5,000. I decided to spend the money and was excited about the results I was told to expect. The hearing aids were delivered roughly 14 days later and I was given 45 day no questions asked return. I gave those about 20 days and was very unhappy with them. The hearing part was okay. I did have some improvement but the cons outweighed the pros. $5,000 was just too much to pay for the poor battery life (6-7 hours) and the rustling noise from my hair brushing against them. I was also having issues with my reading glasses and sunglasses rubbing on them and even knocking them off my ears. Now to my dilemma. I need hearing aids but I know I had issues. I started the Google process which lead to Instagram. To be honest I watched so many videos it was beginning to make my head hurt. I narrowed it down to two. Eargo 7 and Sony E10. I chose the Eargo 7. There were a few reasons why the Eargo 7’s stood out to me and one my choice. First and foremost for ME was the in-ear design and NO behind the ear. I really liked the support given by Eargo and access to a person. One of the features that has really become one of my favorites is the charging case. I can wear the aids ALL day and then place them in the charging case to charge back up. I place the case in my pocket and go to work. Once at work I can place the hearing aids in my ears and use them that day. The next night I place them back into the charging case and plug that up to charge. I repeat this process every other day. Plus I have the case charged ready to go in case I need to remove the aids for some reason or they need charging. The need to charge has not happened yet. The need to remove them has happened twice. It did take me about a week to get use to them. I had a little more uncomfortableness in my right ear. I almost believed that my right ear canal was a little more narrow than my left. Now I barely know that they are in. I actually almost went to bed with them in one night. As far as hearing which is really the main reason for hearing aids I truly believe that I hear better with them in. I can sit on the couch and hear the TV with the volume at a non-grandpa level. I say huh a lot less and I can hear most conversations better. I still have to pay attention though. A trait that my wife wishes I did better. They say it’s a learning process. They being the staff at Eargo. The staff has been very helpful from the start. I received the hearing aids and set up the account and scheduled a orientation call. That call pointed me to the Sound Match. Once the Sound Match was done then the Eargo 7’s were matched to my hearing needs. This feature made a difference for me and my enjoyment over just the factory settings and basic volume control. I find myself using the normal setting mostly and TV secondly. Opinions are just that but for me I am very happy and satisfied with my decision and choice to go with Eargo 7. I waited several weeks intentionally before giving this review to try to give the best review as possible. I’m glad I did because if I had given it when my ears hurt during the first few days then the review would not have been fair. Robert P"
9,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Great hearing aids!,"For more than 30 days I have been using the latest version of Eargo - Eargo7.During this time, I have gained enough experience in using this device.Pro:1. Very comfortable and easy to use and maintain the device.2. Easy and simple to customize to the user's requirements via the phone.3. No need to go to an audiologist for customization.4. Virtually no irritation in the ear canal.Cons:1. Closed petals cause irritation in the ear - very itchy. Open petals do not irritate the ear at all.2. Charger lid does not close well when using open petals.3. Found virtually no difference, using different programs: Normal, Music, Phone, Restaurant.4. The above programs are not described in any way in the manual or on the website and cannot be changed.5. There is no case included for the charger and charging cord that could be used for traveling.Overall I highly recommend it!Update on 03/29/24:After the latest software update almost 3 months ago eargo device cannot communicate with software. Support cannot help and I cannot use this device. Waste of money..."
9,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Eargo 7 so far have been a great experience,"After an exhausting comparison of products currently on the market for hearing aid devices, we decided to go with the Eargo 7. They are small in the ear design, hardly noticeable with great clarity. I have mild to moderate hearing deficits and did not realize how much I have been missing. The noise cancellation feature helps me focus on conversation in noisy environments. The app for them easily downloaded on to my phone and is easy to use even if you are not a tech savvy person. You receive messages through the app with tips that will help if you have any questions regarding the devices. Of course you do have the option to call or text your rep if you have any questions. Their response team has been great. Definitely not a here you go see you later kind of company. I do have tinnitus for over 20 years and have been told by my audiologist that there is not much they can do for it. The hearing aids seem to help retrain the ears to put that ringing in the background rather than in the foreground. They have changed my life in a positive way and my vocabulary has changed from “ what did you say” to a more appropriate answer."
9,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Eargo 7 hearing aids have changed my life,"I started this journey by having an audiologist evaluate the current state of my hearing. I have had hearing aids for about ten years and rarely wore them due to issues with wind noise, noise from glasses, or anything that came close to the over-the-ear microphones – very annoying (and did I mention my vanity and how they looked?).After the appointment I reviewed the options provided by the audiologist and also did a lot of searching the internet for other options and reviews. That is where I came across the Eargo HA and requested the (non-functional) samples.I had not heard from Eargo by my second appointment so I decided to try the Starkey Genesis AI ITC R hearing aids.Once I had the Starkey HA, your samples arrived and I marveled at the size and fit. The (non-functional) samples were REALLY helpful – so much so, I gave them to my audiologist.The Starkeys’ were much better than my old HAs but still picked up significant wind noise and although they had very good sound, they seemed to isolate me from the sounds. I was always aware that I was wearing them.  And it also was very obvious that I was wearing HAs.As both HAs were returnable, I decided to do a side-by-side comparison.Ordered the Eargo from Amazon and they arrived the next day. Setup was easy, very similar to the Starkeys’ with the added step of the hearing test (which although was not as comprehensive as the audiologist testing it seems to have come up with the similar hearing curve). I then changed out the closed petals for the open ones – for me, much more natural sounding.The combination of comfort level, appearance (or lack of one) and sound quality won me over almost immediately. I played two hours of tennis on a very windy day and didn’t pick up any ‘extra’ wind noise. I forgot that I was wearing them!People can’t tell I am wearing them, however I am telling everyone about them as I think they are fantastic. BTW, I was notified that in 2024 my Blue Cross / Blue Shield Medicare Advantage is now including Eargo in their HA coverage.I now wear them ALL day and my wife is now telling people that they have ‘saved our marriage’."
9,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love my Eargos!,"I can hear the birds singing and so much else I’ve been missing out on as my hearing deteriorated, and I can enjoy phone conversations again. I love how the devices fit up inside my ears and are comfortable to wear. Eargo technical staff were quite helpful in initial adjustments, and the app is user friendly even for an older person like me. I am recommending them to a friend who was advised she needs hearing aids."
9,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Customer service is fantastic,"I have never before experienced a company that was so pro-active in making sure their customers are satisfied.  As soon as I received my hearing aids, they started sending me emails with video links to make sure I knew how to use the product.  They set up a phone consultation with a real live person to make sure everything was going well.  I recently did develop a problem:  the pull-string on the right unit fell off for some reason and I had to go to Urgent Care to have the unit removed.  I called Eargo the  next day and was immediately talking to a real live, sympathetic human being who took all the relevant information and got working on the problem right away.  The problem hasn't been completely resolved yet (I've been promised a replacement), but I have been receiving email updates on the situation.  I would recommend Eargo gladly on the strength of their highly responsive customer care."
9,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,The best and most reasonable hearing aids,"I’m currently using a Eargo 7. Prior to purchasing the  Eargo 7, I had a test trial on a behind the ear amplifier Hearing Aid. The major drawback for me was having that visible earpiece behind my ear. So I tried to Eargo. Because of the convenience  and discreetness of the Eargo 7,  my concern was the quality of sound. The Eargo 7 met and exceeded my expectations. I am very satisfied with the product and also very impressed with the customer service. My audiologist responds very promptly to all of my requests."
9,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,They work!,"I have noticed Eargo's genuine interest in customer satisfaction. It really is appreciated and helps me feel more comfortable that if issues do arise, I'll have support.I am very happy with my new Eargo 7s!I love the esthetics of the design and was surprised with my original pair to find how much they helped without my realizing it at first.I recall early-on, watching tv with my wife and taking them out. Then I discovered just how much clarity and volume I lost without them. It really shocked me. For me, that was a powerful confirmation of just how much they were helping me.The main concern I had before buying my next set is one I share with the Fitbits I have bought in the past - charging reliability.My Eargo5s stopped charging after a while and I felt I had no recourse after the warranty period ended. I see that Eargo has taken measures to educate and equip people to properly clean their Eargos and charging stations. I have very much taken that to heart and so far have had zero issues - either with charging or the performance of the Eargos. I have had the typical break-in period of acclimating to my now loud, clacky keyboard, and other crackly high frequency sounds. But I realize that it's just a matter of acclimation (and your videos do a great job of concisely addressing such things). One thing I struggled with at first was that due to the shape of my ear canal, my right ear piece would work its way deeper into my ear and become very uncomfortable. I swapped in the larger petals and experimented with how far to insert the ear pieces and now it's all quite comfortable."
9,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Life Changing,"What they don’t tell you about hearing loss is the avoidance of conversations from people around you and loved ones because they always have to repeat themselves.  I didn’t know how bad my hearing loss was until I bought a pair of Eargo 7’s.  My life changed immediately for the better. My close relationships with my wife and kids got better because none of us were frustrated that I couldn’t hear them.  These Eargos are small, discrete, and fit inside your ear canal.  They are not simply ’amplifiers’ as some who don’t have a pair would suggest.  They are legitimate over the counter hearing aids approved by the FDA.  Nobody knows you are wearing them unless you tell them.  They are programmed by you using an app on your phone.  When you hear a beep, you click ‘yes’ and if you don’t you click ‘no’. Takes about 10 minutes or less after an initial charge to set up.  This ‘Sound Match’ profile tunes the frequencies you can’t hear so you can hear them.  For me it was the frequencies that enable clarity in conversation, music and television.  My wife no longer asks me to turn down the TV.  They stay charged all day.  I can’t recommend them enough.  45 day money back guarantee from Eargo.  If you don’t like them, you can send them back.  The first week or so is a bit strange as you hear sounds you have not heard in a long time.  After that first week, it seems normal.  I can’t wait to put them in the morning.  Give them a shot and stock with them, you won’t regret it."
9,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Totally invisible to others, Excellent sound quality, Amazing support from company","I had been reading reviews of hearing aids for quite awhile knowing that I would need them even before I went to my audiologist. I found that no other hearing aid would be as invisible as the Eargo which was one of the more important parameters for my choice (so yes I am vain). My audiologist had several models to try and her argument for buying directly from her was that I could make appointments for each of several months a year to have adjustments. Despite this apparent advantage I figured I would try the Eargo, since there is a trial period for full refund. They sent me mock ups of the device that were the shell without electronics to see if they were comfortable to wear: they were! I went with the Eargo 7, the sound quality is excellent and they are easy to use and charge. Because they are so small they do not have the battery capacity to stream music or connect to a phone but that was totally irrelevant to me, I can still do both the traditional way. Lastly, with respect to service, I had an issue with communication between the phone app and the hearing aids via the hearing aid charging saddle. I contacted Eargo and very quickly had guidance as to the method to correct the problem. They transferred me right away to somebody in tech support who gave me instructions which I followed and it resolved the issue. Every instance of my having a need to communicate with Eargo has been quick, responsive with an upbeat and cheery tone, and most importantly successful. No appointments necessary. They can adjust settings from their HQ, you need to have the volume range adjusted, done!One more point, if you have insurance, they take care of all of that for you."
9,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love my new Eargo6,"This is my third set of Eargos. I received my new Eargo6 devices last month. They have worked like a dream. Sound quality is better, easier to maintain and the music setting makes my music so clear! The new Sound Match function tuned them to my ears without a problem and did a better job than when I received my fist hearing devices from a store front supplier. Way to go Eargo!"
9,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good customer service,"I had to order the 7 System because one of my Neo eargo’s quit working and since that model isn’t made anymore it was necessary, I buy new. I decided to go for the 7 System since it appeared to be the most advanced. I can say that they are a quantum leap forward from the Neo system I had. The quality of my hearing is better, the devices are easier to use (switching programs, volume, etc.) and the cleaning regime is more robust with better results. All in all, I was frustrated when I had to buy new devices but now that I have them, I wish I’d gotten them sooner!! Your engineers did a fine job learning from the early devices and making the new ones better."
9,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,A lot of money for less than 2 years use.,"Batteries started to last less and less, Called Eargo I was informed they couldn't be replaced."
9,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great: Worth consideration,These are my first hearing aids so I was a little skeptical. I found they work great and are truly missed if I forget to insert them. They did take a month or so to get used to and customer service was very helpful during this period.  Certainly worth considering for anyone in the market!
9,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Not happy,"Not happy with their after sale followup, as I had an eargo no longer working. They went through the process of thorough cleaning with me and still did not work. I returned the earpiece as instructed with a tracking number. Several weeks later they claim to have not received and continue to send me messages to return the item. The tracking number shows it was delivered. Very disappointed with the after followup."
9,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Geat product, great support","I have had Eargo 7 devices for just under six months now. These are my first hearing aids.I am completely satisfied with the performance of the device and extremely pleased with their support. When I have had a question I send them an email, and I get a call from a support rep the next business day.One device stopped holding a charge after a few months. I contacted Eargo and they sent me a replacement immediately. The two-year warranty makes me confident in this purchase.I wear the devices for about 13-15 hours a day. After the first couple weeks, I seldom realize I have them in my ears. With the exception of the one device that failed, they have never run out of battery power during use."
9,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Make a difference in your life,"After months of research, I purchased the Eargo 5 hearing aids. They have performed flawlessly. The Bluetooth enabled feature makes adjustments simple. They are a well made product. I can finally hear sounds that I’ve been missing. The Eargo hearing aids made a huge difference in my life."
9,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Top of the line for OTC Hearing Aids,"I have tried two other OTC HA's and while they all work, these are better.  Under the right circumstances these reallyhelp with hearing what people say and hearing things one hasn'theard for awhile ==like high-pitched tinkling sounds from a wind chime,made of thin 50 cent size round glass.Sometimes I forget they are in.  I do not wear them everyday or allday, as they are still un natural.  In small groups, each speakersounds much more distinct, and that situation is my main use of theEargo 7's.I haven't decided yet which petal I like the most.  I use either themedium ventilated or the small solid petal  I have not changed themic cover.  I do clean often with iso pro alcohol.Twice I was unable to remove one of the aids and had to use tweezersto extract.  That was, surprisingly, a claustrophobic experience notbeing able to get a purchase on the aid, as the nylon string gotfolded underneath the Eargo.  So be careful when inserting, especiallyif you do not have access to a pair of tweezers or the like .From now on I carry a pair of tweezers attached to the Eargo holder bytape......Be sure to keep your phone nearby with the eargo app running, so youcan make changes, depending on the environment.Be nice to compare these with one of the upper end, not over the counter, set of hearing aids tuned by a pro, instead of me........."
9,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Eargo 7 is wasting tremendous potential,"Eargo 7 has a tremendous potential as a hearing aid that would help so many people who has mild to moderate hearing loss like me. Device is almost invisible, rechargeable, and has high-technology for noise cancelation, sound adjustments, and ease of app usage. It's been a week since the delivery, I am having a mixed feeling for this device. I really wanted this hearing aids to work for me, however I am torn between whether to keep it or return. The reason I said the wasting potentially great product is that this hearing aids simply wouldn't stay in my ear canal. I use medium size open petals and push them in as hard as I could into the ear canal, but very short time later (matter of minutes) I could feel it slipped out and resting on my earlobe. This is totally unacceptable. Not only it will not function properly out of the ear canal but also it will drop to ground and get broken or lost. The design engineering team should have developed a smaller petals, use tacky materials or anything they can think of so that it prevents from slipping out. As I said, this hearing aids actually have great engineering technologies built-in and do work in terms of shaping frequency response for typical hearing losses, I believe.I did sound match program initially and the Eargo professional Christine revised another sound match profile after I sent her my audiometry diagram. The revised sound match profile did sound better. This Eargo 7 does have feedback problem and occlusion effects. Open petals seem to help to reduce the occlusion effects somewhat. Sounds are a bit tinny, but not too bad. I have 45 days to decide to keep it or return. I really would like to have the Eargo 7 team look into this serious problem when they see this review. This is an initial review, however this device should get 5 stars. I will review further in details after the 45 days trial period is over. By that time, I will have either returned it or kept it with reluctance unless Eargo 7 team comes up with a solution. Hear me Eargo 7 team, fix this problem please."
9,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Really helps hearing,"I bought these about a month ago right before starting an in-office job after a long time remote. I'm in my 50s but I kept missing half the conversation when speaking with people so I was really glad these came along. They fit fine, every so often I adjust them a little (pull them out or push them in about 1-2 mm), but I can do it without anyone noticing. They are invisible, it's really amazing. And the improvement is incredible - I can actually hold conversations. The set up and hearing self test was easy, and my included appointment with an audiologist was really helpful. Every so often I get feedback, like a popping sound, but I prefer that to not hearing. You do hear EVERYTHING at first until your brain filters out random noise after a few weeks (lightswitches are loud!). I'm really glad I got these and I think they've made a noticeable different in my life."
9,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Eargo 7 hearing aides are awesome,"I wore the old style behind the ear hearing aid for a year and a half.  They were helpful, just not very satisfactory to my hearing.  The sound was not normal, often blaringly loud, and background noise dominated social situations.  I wanted something better.  I wanted a more normal sound that didn't just amplify noise.Then I tried Eargo 7, and what an impressive improvement.  With the microphone in your ear, sounds funneled in naturally using your ear, so they sounded much more normal.  The hearing test done by an app on your phone identified where you needed more help. Restaurant conversations were now comfortable rather than strained.The company has multiple videos to be sure you understand all the features and how to use your Eargos.  Actual humans reach out to check on your progress, offer advice and help.  It's a great product backed by serious professionals who want to help make your Eargos experience a success.The Eargo hearing experience is so normal you forget you have them in your ears! Thank goodness they are waterproof.  I wore them probably too much the first day because I was visiting family and enjoying hearing so well.  Now I've had a couple of days of tender ear canals as I adjust to the tiny device.  Eargo offers two types and sizes of petals to offer different fits.I have been wearing my Eargo 7 for a week. Even with some ear canal discomfort,  I am still  so glad I bought these wonderful hearing aids.  These tiny devices are a such a huge improvement, even my family can tell how much better I can hear.  And the charging case lights up to help you place your device correctly as well as tell you the charging level.Eargo 7 are so worth it.  I highly recommend this company's high quality product and excellent support services."
9,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you can get past the flaw, it's an impressive system","A really well conceived system; performance is excellent.  There is one flaw, however.  An artifact...a kind of warbling or tremolo...is present and is especially noticeable with tonals.  These are sounds primarily at a particular frequency, like the beeps when a truck reverses or your meal is ready in a microwave.  Until I wore these, I didn't appreciate how many of these are present in a modern acoustical environment.You can see a visual representation of the artifact in the attached images.  On the left is a steady 3kHz tone (in the range of human speech) recorded with a smartphone.  The image on the right shows the sawtooth pattern created by the artifact - an amplitude modulation at about 50Hz.The artifact is detectable on all sound sources but pronounced with tonals.  If you can get past that, Eargo 7 is a excellent choice."
9,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,A True Engineering Masterpiece,"I had a hearing test by a certified audiologist about 3 months ago. The results confirmed that I have a typical age-related hearing loss profile along with a modest case of Tinnitus. I purchased a set of over-the-ear hearing aids ($5k) from their in house establishment and received a custom tuning for my particular needs as identified by the test results with a 30 day return policy. This was an over-the-ear unit with 2 microphones. I found the sound clarity quite lacking as the microphones are above and behind the ear and they interfered with my glasses (another age affliction) earpiece significantly. I returned them.I then purchased an Eargo 7 set ($2.6k) and set the default program for each ear. My test, as with the other hearing aids, was playing concert quality music over a stereo. With the Eargos, I found the music clarity quite good, especially in quiet interludes. The Eargo 7 has 4 default programs that can be changed easily while wearing by gently thumping the ear that you want to change. The earpieces are about the diameter of a small pencil and fit easily into the ear canal. This is a decided advantage over the over-the-ear units as it uses the sound gathering shape of the ear to direct the sound. I did switch to open Petals, recommended on my Welcome Call, which were more comfortable and had no discernible effect on the sound quality. I did not welcome my need to have to use hearing aids but the Eargos are keepers for me. I recommended them to my adult daughter who was using over-the-ear aids, she purchased them and is very impressed after several trials with other aids. She has been experimenting with using the online customization tools. I might follow afterwards if she recommends them over the default programs that seem to be customized very well for age-related hearing loss.One recommendation - use the videos and other resources that Eargo has; their customer service is truly exceptional."
9,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good sound quality for a hearing aid,"The device is small and fit well in my ear. The sound quality is good, although I don't know what is considered perfect quality for a hearing aid, given that I have no other devices to compare against.Overall, I am satisfied with what I purchased (despite it relatively high price)."
9,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Eargo 7,"I can't say enough about these hearing aids. No more batteries to worry about, you put them in your charger and they're ready in the morning. Customer service is great and a person will contact you if you have questions. And my tinitis goes away with these hearing aids when wearing them. I'm so satisfied with the hearing aids I recommend the Eargo 7 for everyone, they cost half of my other aids and are twice as good. You can't go wrong with these aids. Order them today you will not be disappointed."
9,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Easy to use, great sound quality and almost invisible.","My experience with Eargo 7 has been excellent. I use them mainly as back up when my Phonak Lyric hearing aids fail, and I cannot get them replaced easily. That said on the occasion I have used Eargo 7 they are easy to use, great sound quality and almost invisible."
9,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Most comfortable hearing aid!,"These hearing aids are extremely comfortable and unlike my other small in ear aids these do not make my ears itch.  They felt great from the first moment I put them in and so far, there is a marked improvement in my hearing- even in a restaurant.  Looking forward to trying them outside in the wind later this weekend.  So nice to be able to set up hearing settings via the app.  So far, a great product that i am looking forward to wearing and NO BATTERIES!!"
9,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Good but didn’t work as expected,"I like these and wanted to love them but they have some shortcomings.- the app uses high frequency sounds from your phone to adjust settings on the in-ear pieces.  If you are in a loud environment, or have your phone sound level turned low, or the phone isn’t pointed in the right direction, the changes don’t register.  I sometimes had one side adjust but the other didn’t.  Annoying that changes just don’t always register.- exacerbating this annoyance, when changes are made the alert beep is VERY LOUD in your ear.  And it’s not adjustable. I actually found myself not making adjustments some times because I didn’t want that loud loud beep.  It was absolutely uncomfortable for me and disappointing that it isn’t adjustable.  I’m guessing they will fix this eventually. But this loud beep and the inconsistent acceptance of changes mean you are sometimes getting multiple beeps to get your one adjustment made.- they are amazingly small. But I did have pain in my ear canal at times.  Bad enough that I’d take a day off to heal. I imagine this will go away eventually but it’s something to deal with as you acclimate to them.But overall my dissatisfaction is that they just didn’t restore my hearing all that well. I used them for 3 and a half weeks with maybe 4 days off due to pain, but didn’t find them consistently good enough.  They absolutely worked well for clarity of online meetings … I turned my speaker down nearly 50% and the clarity was great.  If that was the same in the real world I would have loved these.  But out in the world, they block some of the mid level sounds and that makes it hard to hear.  I was looking for a smooth and consistent volume of all frequencies but they don’t do that well. I did the custom hearing test and used the setting that adjusted frequencies based on those results but it wasn’t super effective.  I would have really liked a simple equalizer option so I could tinker with levels.  As it is, you cannot see the results of your test nor adjust them. You can only choose to use that calibration or not. So, either it works for you or it doesn’t.  The version 7 of these has a few additional override adjustments but I didn’t find them effective.I like how small they are. I’ve held off on any solution because I hate the idea of them being seen. It’s my hang up but not something I’ll get over easily so I will exhaust every option before moving away from these small styles.  These are great in that regard.  I had nearly zero concern about them being seen and even when I asked people, they didn’t notice unless they were behind me and literally looking into my ear.So, I’ll be trying other models on my journey to better hearing but may come back to these if other brands are worse. I’m hoping devices from a hearing specialist will come with more adjustments so we can tweak the settings.Oh - and their support was outstanding.  Definitely do the consulting/intro meeting.  I learned a lot and the specialist gave me great ideas on how to make them work best."
9,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Discrete, Comfortable and Easy to Use","I've had my Eargo 7s for a little over a month now and I'm completely happy with them. I can wear them all day without any discomfort. In fact, I just forget I'm wearing them most days. I tried the closed petals for a few days, but for me the mid-sized open petals work the best.Do yourself and your family a favor and deal with your hearing loss issues. Everyone will be happy you did!"
9,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Back to Hearing my Surrondings,"If I had my choice I would not wear hearing aids but since I was diagnosed with moderate hearing loss I got my first hearing aids.  They fit fine but I could never get them like it was when I could hear all sounds.  I could go back to the store for more adjustments.  The hearing aids had to be controlled with my cell phone which I generally do not carry around.  Then I heard of Eargo and sent away for a sample hearing aid to feel the fit in my ears.  Then I ordered a pair of Eargo 7’s.  From the outstanding packaging, equipment, instructions and people support, I have been more than satisfied.  I like the email hints, lessons, and reminders to get me satisfied with my Eargo.  I like the small size, clarity, and the ability to change programs just by tapping my ear.  And the programs can be updated like my iPad does and they cost half as much as my 2 3/4 year old ears!"
9,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent quality hearing aids,"I'm 68 and have been aware of encroaching hearing loss for a few years. I finally decided to pursue hearing aids, and initially used some bequested over-the-ears from my late mother. They were adequate but obvious, and there was only a volume control for sound modification.I'm fussy about sound as I am a speech pathologist and was a professional opera singer. I attend many concerts as my wife is a concert cellist. I decided to look around at the latest OTC hearing aids and see if I could deplete my HSA. I looked at hysterical James Bond look-alike audiologist videos on YouTube, but ultimately felt that their job was to push the latest product, and not be critical of obvious under-performers that I subsequently tried  but rejected, e.g. Jabra Enhance, Sony CRE-E10  and AirPod Pro 2s . . . I tried each for a couple of hours and found them to be boomy and echoey respectively. I really thought the Jabras were going to be the real deal as they were Bluetooth and rechargeable . . . but the music fidelity was poor (particularly when contrasted with normal AirPods).I finally decided to try the Sony CRE-C10 and Eargo 6 aids for about a whole month. (An advantage of buying these products from Amazon is that there is an excellent return policy.)  I really liked the CRE-C10s, but ultimately the ability to change settings was relatively limited (bass vs. treble, and volume only); the fidelity was good, but not as good as the Eargo 6s. I researched some more and looked up more reviews . . . and returned the 6s for 7s which were on sale for only $200 more . . . for the extra money I received more parameter, noise, and program controls.  Control is easy from the Eargo app. A negative is that the app can't tell you the settings that you have adjusted, and you have to hear BOTH aids register changes. The Eargo support staff whom I subsequently contacted (I tried to avoid the initial set-up session as I wanted to explore on my own) were remarkably friendly, knowledgeable, and PROMPT in responding to various queries by phone or email.So . . . long review, but I wanted to relate my process to other folks. The Eargos are really worth the extra money, and I'm now a committed wearer (but still fine tuning the adjustments).  I work in an ENT office with audiologists, and they were also impressed with the Eargos when they measured intensity/air pressure levels in my ear . . .  I did not buy their prescription products even though I could get them for cost +10%. They were genuinely interested in the OTC competition and are still friendly to me . . . .It's nice to not to miss out on conversations now, and I'm hearing some quiet friends for the first time in years. Listening to high quality music and my singing are still requiring adjustment.Con: I wish the charging case was a little smaller. The Sony CRE-C10 case size was perfect . . . but they were battery operated."
9,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love my EARGO 7 Hearing Aids!,"Yes, 5 STARS! My experience with the Eargo 7 Hearing Aids has so far been WONDERFUL! I have had them for about 3 weeks, and I do wonder how I managed before them. Not only have they allowed me to hear extremely well, I love their invisibility, as well. Before purchasing the Eargo 7 Hearing Aids, I reviewed several other hearing aids and even purchased a few, but none offered the invisibility I preferred as the Eargo Hearing Aids.  I have always avoided wanting to wear hearing aids because I often wear my hair up and I did not want them to show. Recently, I visited my hair stylist, and she complimented me on my studded earrings and never noticed the hearing aids until I pointed them out to her! Vanity much! Remember to remove them before showering, swimming or washing your hair! 😉I did experience some soreness from wearing the hearing aids the first few days and maybe that's because my ear canal is small or just wearing some in your ear takes some getting used to, but since then I usually forget they are there, but I never forget how well I hear now! So, the only main issue I have experienced is the left device has not lasted more than 14 hours per wear, and my understanding is that they should last around 16 hours. I have been in communication with an Eargo Rep, and we are working though fixing that issue, which leads me to note that Eargo has REALLY GREAT CUSTOMER CARE SERVICE! I do not believe I waited more than a couple of minutes to speak to someone on my initial phone call. I truly believe the Eargo Rep is concerned about any issues I may be experiencing and wants to help resolve those issues. The Eargo Rep answered all the questions I had written down and provided valuable tips that will help me keep them clean and working to their optimum performance and followed up by emailing those tips to me with other helpful information.  Do not wait, go ahead and get the EARGO HEARING AIDS, you will not regret it! 😊"
9,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Eargos are incredible,"A few months ago I purchased a set of Eargo 7 hearing aids, I previously used hearing aids that I purchased from a hearing aid clinic.  They were ok sometimes but I struggled with using them in different environments.  Since using the Eargo 7 it has been a pleasure, being able to adjust them my self as my environments and activities change has been amazing.  Much enjoyable to use in an active lifestyle."
9,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very happy with these!,I would highly recommend these hearing aids. They have performed very well so far. The App allows for adjustment of the Sound/ Type of input. I actually have it amplifying at less than the max volume level.The big plus for this product is that it is invisible in the ear. Being older but in shape and working out the last thing I want to do is have a Hearing Aid visible in my ear. No one at all has noticed I have one. I have to point it out and they have to look very hard to see it. The batteries have lasted easily through a long day and into the evening. Also very comfortable to wear. I would buy this product again.
9,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,I finally found hearing aids that work!!!,"Eargo has hit a home run. For years I have tried to find hearing aids that fit my lifestyle and at the same time worked well. I love the outdoors, I snow ski, bike ride, golf and hike. Behind the ear models I bought years ago were expensive and never sounded great especially in crowded environments like restaurants. They increased the sound around me instead of helping me hear the people speaking at my table. Also, over time they would fail due to sweat and sunscreen clogging the microphones. With time my hearing has worsened, and I started a new search, I was pleased to find that technology has improved. I first looked at the behind the ear products and they have come down in price as well as offer bluetooth connectivity. A couple years ago, well after my behind the ear units failed, I bought an inexpensive ($300) pair of in the ear amplifiers. I liked how the looked and felt even though they were difficult to adjust the volume and had feedback when I touched my ear. I used them sparingly, main to watch TV and in meetings. This brought my interest to Eargo. After much research and reading reviews, I decided to buy them, even though they were much more expensive than the behind the ear units.They arrived in a few days, and I went through the self-test to set them up. It took about 20 minutes but was very easy to do. Immediately I noticed how comfortable they were, much more than the cheap units I had. That night I used them to watch TV and I was able to hear every word that was spoken. Of course, I played with the various setting available on my iPhone App. I scheduled the phone interview with the specialist at Eargo a few days after using them, which I highly recommend. The lady was very helpful with my questions and gave me some great tips on cleaning and charging. I have had them for almost two weeks now and I wear them all day, around 10 to 12 hours. In every environment, restaurants, on the golf course, watching TV, at church, they have performed beyond my expectations. I can hear so much that I didn't realize I was missing. Each day I get a follow-up email from Eargo with a tip and reminder, I assume this will go on for a week or two more. I made an excellent decision buying Eargo, I hope this helps others who are considering new hearing aids."
9,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Game changer,I have had high frequency hearing loss in left ear for number of years. I am a physician and was a bit hesitant to get aids as I had been given mixed messages about them helping. These have been incredible. My wife noticed immediately. Very easy to do the setup. I have also used the noise reduction features a lot at restaurants and other louder venues.
9,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Review + update,"The devices are life changing -- to be able to hear again is like gaining another sense.  I'm pleased with the performance of the devices (have had them for approx 7 months now) and my experiences with their staff have been stellar.  The audiologist I spoke with when setting up the devices could not have been more helpful.  The exchange process went smoothly -- when there was a snag, it was resolved quickly.  And the staff I have interacted with have been exceptional... competent, cheerful, and appreciative of my business.I'm a fan!6/2024 updateAfter over a year of wearing, I'm still quite pleased with both the devices and the customer support.  I had NO idea just how bad my hearing had deteriorated until I started wearing these; what a difference to be able to converse without straining!Customer service is excellent; anytime I've had a problem or question, I've been able to email or call and speak with an actual knowledgeable person.  Response time on emails is within a day, and phone calls do not have the horrible wait times or the dreaded numerical list of items that invariably don't include the correct situation.In addition, I'm super pleased with the reminders that I receive to clean/deep clean the devices.  They're timed in a way so as to actually be useful, not too infrequent to be of use or, worse, annoyingly pestering.Great company!"
9,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent- better than Oticon.....,"Why?  Half the price of Oticon.  Charger cord type C is not permanently attatched.  Super small no over ear dongle.  Easy to clean.  Free Android app is basic, simple and not buggy or annoying.  Customer service answers emails very timely."
9,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Listen up,"These very expensive hearing aids work well, but have limitations in terms of fine-tuning and adjusting to various ambient conditions. I think they provided good amplification and excellent customer service and follow up."
9,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Review of Eargo 7 Hearing Aid,"The Eargo hearing aids have exceeded my expectations.  I am now able to hear my companions while dining out or eating at home.  I no longer need to have the closed captions on when watching TV.  And much to my surprise, the symbols have returned to the music I listen to; imagine that! I’ve been very impressed at what an advanced product this is.  Starting with the boxing, just like Apple would do.  The very thorough instructions and videos were perfect, I feel I have learned well what is needed to keep my devices clean and working.  The charging system is also magnificent. The Sound Match program was very advanced yet simple.  It appears to have eliminated the need to see an audiologist, which I suspect was your goal.  And finally, no one has noticed them :-))  I considered many of the available aids and am very glad I chose Eargo 7"
9,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Join the hearing world again,"I ordered these in January of 2024.  I am so pleased I got them.  They are easy to set up, easy to adjust and no one can see them!!  I found the closed petals to be too itchy but the open petals work great."
9,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,Awful performance - Worst purchase in years,"When I bought these, I did a fair amount of due diligence, including reviews and comparisons with other products. Did not look for cheaper options.The basic problems -They will not work with tablets (IOS or Android). This is hidden in the tech details - not obvious before purchase.(Note that before the purchase, I downloaded the Eargo App to both and Android and an IOS tablet. If they don't work, they should be pulled ...)To reduce size, they rely on a special ultrasound technology to communicate with the app on the phone. It works less than 30% of the time. Even when connecting to the App, many of the features just don't work. This is incredibly frustrating.They must be kept scrupulously clean, and parts must be replaced frequently.I was traveling away from home when I received them. I tried to work with them, and had a lot of downtime trying to get them to work. Although they were inconsistent, I thought I'd resolve the problems.Big mistake - My fault.Should have returned them in the 30 day window,Later on, when I found out about the tablet restrictions and the details concerning the ultrasonic technology, it was too late. Customer Service absolutely refused a late return.Worst purchase I've made in 10 years. I'll probably have to invest in a new pair from a different manufacturer this year.If you do buy them, be sure to return quickly if you have same or similar issues."
9,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,I was missing a lot!,"For over a year I’ve been telling my spouse to “speak up, stop mumbling, I can’t hear you.”  A great deal of frustration for both of us.  I recall telling him the beeper on the microwave was dying; I couldn’t hear it as well as I used to.  Always requesting him to turn up the volume on the television.  Many sounds were lost that I wasn’t aware were missing until I got my Eargo 7.  A dripping faucet, the sound of a light switch, the crinkling sound of wrapping with waxed paper.  The technology is amazing and the customer service remarkable.  I’m totally confident that Eargo has got my back and will be there for me when I need them.  Special thank you to Jalene the Eargo audiologist who set up my aids.  Susan Foster, SC"
9,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,They work!,"As a first time user of a hearing aid, I was quite nervous, but Eargo had the qualities I was looking for….OTC, in the ear, customizable (self-fitting) and professional support.  They are not the least expensive, but they are worth the price.  I can’t stress enough the value of professional support available to you by phone.  I am very pleased!"
9,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,My Eargos are life changing!,"After trying other hearing aids without much success, these have made my life much better. I no longer have to be left out of the conversation in restaurants or large gatherings because I couldn’t hear what was being said; nor do I continually have to ask my spouse to repeat himself, which I could tell got on his nerves!The different settings are a big help also, I can really tell a difference when I switch from one to another.I also have no problem with how they fit, which initially I had concerns about one falling out, but the fit is great.I would highly recommend Eargos to anyone with hearing issues."
9,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Horrible. Didn't work from day one,"I suffer from "" moderate"" to ""profound"" hearing lost. I wear ""hearing amplifiers"" because normal hearing aids do not address my particular needs, i.e.: I need to crank up the sound as much as possible. The Eargo's claimed to address needs such as mine OTC units for a cost of $2,600, at or near the same price point as professional audiologist. However, my personal experience was a massive disappointment. The first units they sent me did not appear to function at all. I literally could not hear anything when I wore them. In fact, they only served to ""plug"" my ears closed so I effectively heard nothing at all. After three weeks Eargo sent me a replacement set, free of charge, that were only a minor improvement. I could hear a very limited range of sound, but not enough to hold a conversation or watch TV. I was embarrassed to say that I heard a greater range of sounds with my hearing amplifiers than either of the Eargo's. Since I purchased the original Eargo's through Amazon, I sent them back and received a full refund. I returned the second pair of hearing aids directly to Eargo and was never charged for them. If you suffer from the degree of hearing lost that someone like me does, I urge you to forgo the attempt to initially save money with OTC hearing aids until you have had a professional audiologist evaluate your hearing. I use the best hearing amplifiers on the market and, although they are not cheap, in the range of $450 to $500, they are actually as good as any of the OTC models currently on the market. michaelpaul50"
9,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,They are very comfortable,"While they do not perform quite like I expected after the hype—they come highly recommended by Wirecutter at the New York Times—they are good—not great—at helping me hear better, though I am still experiencing issues in noisy restaurant settings. I find them very comfortable—and I’ve tried a lot of hearing devices in the past 5-6 years; and they are almost completely undetectable."
9,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,By far the best hearing device on the market.,I use them daily. People do not know I am using a hearing device.  They are virtually invisible. The sound quality and noise cancellation are excellent. I charge them overnight and the charge lasts the entire day.I recommend the Eargo 7 without reservation.
9,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love them!,"I love my Eargo 7's!  I'm amazed that they help me to hear everyone at the table in a noisy restaurant, which is what frustrated me (and my family!) before I wore hearing aids.  They are very comfortable, I can happily wear them all day when I need to.  Battery lasts best part of a full day before needing a recharge.I wish it was possible to replace the battery, because as it stands I'm looking at buying a replacement set in about 3 years' time, but all things considered these are a miracle for the price.  My family didn't even know I was wearing them at first, they are almost invisible!  Also, their pre AND after-sales support is great too.  Buy with confidence."
9,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for hearing when going out,"I have well not good hearing, but not terrible either.I use the aids when going out to hear conversations in restaurants and other venues, I now can go out to dinner at a dinner with a show venue I can hear my friends.These hearing aids are by far the best ones in terms of sound quality and background noise reduction.I like the different volume levels for different situations. Plus, they are amazingly comfortable. After a bit, I do not even notice them. Worth the investment for me.The small portable case also acts as charging base and it also helps carry and store the pieces safely, but the top comes off too easily and needs a small redesign to provide a latch to ensure the case does not open by mistake.They are tiny, discreet, and comfortable. Best of all, they are effective.I had doubts when I first received them and spent time talking to support staff to find out what I was doing wrong and better ways to work with the aids, the staff was incredibly supportive and helped me to achieve my desired hearing levels.My left ear has a large canal that with the large petals works great, my right ear has a small canal, and the medium petals are still a bit too large and could use a smaller petal I believe.The iPhone application is easy to use, but I wished it gave status information, like battery levels, and other status items. I would recommend this to a friend"
9,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,A Life Saved,"As we age so unfortunately so do our parents. My father was having trouble hearing. We even thought he was not processing correctly because of the hearing issue.  The grandkids felt he was yelling at them. They often avoided talking to him. His great grandson loved him but ran when he spoke. I could see he was isolating himself. He was not having the same fun conversations with the family. I finally convinced him  to purchase hearing aids.  When he saw how small the device was, he agreed to try them. I did the hearing test with him that prove to him he needed them. He put them on and now only takes them off to recharge them. He can have conversations! I just spoke to him on the phone and he was able to speak to me and understand everything I said. Before he got the eargo... he had his phone so loud his neighbors could hear the speaker and he could not. I see it has even improved his driving made him more aware. His processing has improved because he now understands what we are saying. I wish he had purchased eargo  years ago. What a BIG difference a small device CAN HAVE! It gave him back quality of life. I also have never dealt with a company that has such helpful support. It is a pleasure to speak with representatives who speak English and fully know their produ"
9,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent comfort and adjustment options,"EARGO’s provides multiple adjustments from your phone.  Feedback is non-existent.  Volume a background noise are easily controlled. There are multiple modes for various situations. They are far superior to cheap hearing aids, yet at a price point that most people can afford."
9,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent hearing improvement device.,"Excellent device, hides well, and improves hearing in difficult situations like restaurants.  Well done."
9,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great hearing aid,"About 5 years ago, I decided to purchase the earlier version of the Eargo hearing aid. I did so for simple reasons for me. They are small and do not have the bulky appearance of an over-the-ear hearing aid.  I was drawn to this solution because they were less expensive than “regular” hearing aids and virtually invisible in the ear. Ease of use, reliability, and price swayed me. Over the following  years, these original Eargos began to lose their ability to recharge rendering them unusable. For that reason and the legal changes for hearing aids prompted me to investigate multiple options for replacement. After many searches, I went back to Eargo and compared prices, looks, effectiveness, and whether friendly usable. I found Eargo to have the best option for me as a hearing aid that is inconspicuous in the ear, easy to put in/take out and powerful enough to compensate for my age-related hearing loss. I chose to purchase the Eargo 7 because of those factors as well as being able to make any necessary adjustments with my smart phone. I am happy to enthusiastically recommend the Eargo option and especially the Eargo 7."
9,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,Pop goes the Eargo,"Pop goes the Eargo.I began to lose my hearing early on and have been searching for a company with reliable hearing aid devices. After 3 years using Eargo devices I can definitively say they are not the company for me.Why? Because pop goes the Eargo.  When you watch an action movie and the chase scene climaxes in an explosion--pop goes the Eargo. Be sure to mute them on the highway lest a tractor-trailer passes and pop goes the Eargo. Be careful in a crowded loud restaurant otherwise pop goes the Eargo. These have been actual scenarios in which my Eargo hearing devices failed. Each time I heard a loud whistle sound and then a pop or crack sound and the device was dead--pop goes the Eargo. They appear to use a cheap processor that fails under high decibel sounds.The company shifts their quality issues to to blame you for not properly cleaning the devices. A simple way to tell if any hearing aid device has failed electronically is to simply cup your hand over your ear, or remove the device and hold it inside a closed fist. You should hear a horrible feedback sound, which indicates the device is working properly. Please, you try to explain that to their support technicians, which are programmed to blame you for the device's quality issues. They will try to sell you new petals and caps (see photos). They are not cheap, and another avenue for Eargo to make lots of money.The concept is great and you can see from the picture they are invisible. Besides the lack of quality in the processor, you'll notice terrible feedback about which many complain. You will find that setting the noise filter to low or off will usually correct this problem.If Eargo used quality parts, I would be a permanent customer. As it is when the warranty is up and ""pop goes the Eargo"" devices, I'll search for a quality company."
9,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"easy to use, undetectable. Great quality sound.","I have used hearing aids for over 15 years. I started with the expensive, behind-the-ear models recommended by the audiologist. These worked Ok but failed quickly. I went on to the cheaper online behind -the-ear models which I found to be just as good as the expensive ones, but which also failed rapidly.Eventually I found Eargo. These in-the-ear hearing aids give much better sound reception and avoid the hassle of changing batteries every week.They are very comfortable to wear and last a full 16 hours on one charge. I wear mine all day.  They are easy to adjust using the Eargo App and they are virtually undetectable. Since the batteries (which are inaccessible) last about 2 years; I am now on my 3rd version of Eargo. These Eargo 7's are the best yet and I'm very satisfied with the results. I would recommend Eargo's to anyone."
9,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,Ongoing battery issues,"These are terrific hearing aids - except their battery life is an ongoing problem. I had tried an 'behind the ear' model from Jabra Enhanced, but found them too difficult to use due to the fact that I wear glasses.So - I got a pair of Eargo 7s. Great sound, virtually invisible. Initially, the battery life was 15-16 hours. Then, after around 9-10 months, the battery life on the left hearing aid suddenly dropped to 12 hours. Then, a few weeks later, 10 hours. I contacted customer support, and they had me do the 'deep clean and reboot the software' routine. No change. SO - they sent me a replacement left sided device.Now, the RIGHT sided device has started to lose battery life. Its down to 12 hours.As another reviewer pointed out...that is simply not acceptable.Eargo needs to get this battery issue corrected. Spending 3K on new hearing aids once a year isn't an option."
9,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Eargo 7 rocks,Beginning with Eargo 5 I found the fidelity to be outstanding. The progression from 5 through 7 in terms of filtering background is quite impressive. The devices are customized for my specific hearing loss using Sound Match on the Eargo application. The match I achieved is excellent. The  system requires careful cleaning in order to function properly but I think it well worth the effort
9,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Eargo 7 hearing aid,"I started my journey to recovery the sounds that I have lost due to my hearing difficulties. I began the journey with the big brand name coating over $5k. They just couldn’t give me a quality experience and appointment after appointment I gave up on them and got my money back. Then I discovered the Eargo 7!!!From the moment I received them, they were easy to set up and the sound match was a breeze, that’s it!!! I was hearing the sounds I wanted to hear again!!! 10 times better than those $5k ones!!! Thanks Eargo for making this hearing aid, it gave my world sound again!!! Also helps with my tinnitus as well!!!"
9,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nearly invisible hearing aid,"A few years ago I did a short trial with a hearing aid supplied by an audiologist after getting my hearing. tested. The hearing aid was ugly and required me to replace tiny batteries every couple of weeks. On top of that, whenever I put on my glasses, I heard a sound like paper crinkling.When I heard we can now buy top-quality hearing aids online, I was in. I read all the reviews and time and again, Eargo was recommended as the most invisible and also delivered top quality results. I bought the Eargo 7, and after more than a month, I'm sold on these little dudes. You can barely see them in my ears, the recharging station is similar to ear buds, which will make traveling with these a snap, and I can control various features with a phone app. The support from the Eargo folks has been great. My daughter is thrilled that my hearing is way better--she no longer has to repeat herself! This isn't your cheapest OTC option, but considering it has all the features I was looking for, it's a bargain. I love my Eargos!"
9,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love these hearing aids,"I’m a 74-year-old man that has needed hearing aids for awhile. I read so much about hearing loss leading to dementia and other things that can affect your overall health and well-being. I tried the behind the ear hearing aids a couple of years ago and found them effective, but I never wore them because I didn’t want anyone to think I was old. I did a great deal of research and thought I would try out the Eargo because they are invisible and effective. After 2 months I can verify that they really work, and I wear them all the time without anybody knowing. Their customer service and support are the best I’ve ever seen. Would highly recommend these."
9,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love them,"I bought the old version and wasn't that happy and never wore it.  But got the new one because of the advances on it and glad I did.  They are amazing.  Not only do they work great but you have the ability to adjust preferences by your phone.  However the ""sound check"" that it has makes it so easy to have it programed especially for your ears.  Not only  are they invisible so no one sees them, but they are so comfortable that I forget their in there and sometimes go to bed forgetting to take them out.  One time I even got out of  the shower and went to q tip by ear and forget they were in!  Ha."
9,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Eargo 7- Good hearing aids,"Purchased Eargo 7 hearing aids 3 months ago. These are the first quality hearing aids I have purchased and after a few weeks of learning how to adjust them to my hearing needs , I am quite satisfied with them.  Good natural sound quality and the APP to adjust them works well for me. Took about four weeks to get comfortable with the devices in my ears, but I now forget they are even there. These units have restored normal hearing to me. Folks at Eargo are great to help with issues or advice."
9,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Eargo 7,"Thanks for making such a fantastic product. I can't tell you how much I love Eargo 7 hearing aids. I love your support team also. I hope in the future Eargo 8 may have Bluetooth, and be completely waterproof so I can go to the beach and swim with them in."
9,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent Hearing Aids!,"I am extremely satisfied with my Eargo 7 hearing aids! I find them to be highly effective.  It’s a relief to be able to hear people speaking without thinking that they’re mumbling, and outdoors, the sound of birds singing is delightful.I have to say that I am a bit vain.  I know that I have been suffering from hearing loss for several years now, but I have been stubborn, I didn’t want to get behind-the-ear hearing aids.  Whenever I see someone wearing hearing aids, my first thought is, “that person is old, that’s not for me”.  The beauty of my Eargo 7 hearing aids is that they are truly invisible.  I don’t feel self-conscious using them.  I put them in my ears first thing in the morning and leave them in all day.  They’re comfortable and most of the time I even forget that they’re in my ears.The Eargo company has provided excellent service.  I have had a couple of questions regarding the best settings for different situations.  Within a day, an audiologist has returned my call.  The app on my phone is easy to use.  I always carry my phone with me anyway, so if the need arises, I can easily change the settings.In conclusion, my Eargo 7s are a great product.  They are effective, and they have improved the quality of my life.  I feel that they are well worth the cost, and I highly recommend them."
9,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Few people know I wear hearing aids.,"They are so small and don't interfere with my glasses. Plus, they are infinitely adjustable for sound and surroundings. Love them."
9,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Couldn’t Be More Pleased,"I like everything about my EARGOS. They are easy to insert, virtually invisible, rechargeable and easy to clean. They work so well that the other day when my daughter (who has a very soft voice) visited, I was able to hear every word she said for the first time in years. I have nothing negative to say about this product."
9,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,BOOM!,"I have been using my Eargo 7's for a full week now, and could not be happier!  Works great, discreet, good app controls.  My ears have adapted nicely, no problems so far.  I recommend the Eargo 7.  Good buy!"
9,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best so far!,"Effortless daily use vs over the ear.  Very easy to set up. Forget you even have them on and no crackling sounds like others I have tried. Charging is very simple and convenient. Would like sound volume to be higher though. Would recommend, will buy again when next update is available."
9,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great improvement,"Fit was easy, comfortable after trying different pedal designs, my hearing loss is moderate to severe. I can now hear conversations much better and have the ability to stay in the conversation without guessing what was said.  Adjustability is great for many situations. Love my new hearing. Great customer service Paul and Lindsey were very helpful with advice on fit and Adjustability"
9,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,IT'S A GREAT PRODUCT !,I AM THOROUGHLY PLEASED WITH MY EARGO 7 PURCHASE IN JULY OF 2023. THE PERFORMANCE AS BEEN AS ADVERTISED AND I REALLY LIKE THE LOOK AND FIT. I REMEMBER BEING VERY IMPRESSED WITH THE INTRODUCTION AND PHONE ASSISTANCE RIGHT AFTER PURCHASE. I GET CONSTANT EMAIL REMINDERS FOR ACTIONS I SHOULD TAKE TO KEEP MY EQUIPMENT IN GOOD OPERATING CONDITION. I AM ABLE TO MAKE PHONE CONTACT IF I HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. THE CONTACT PERSONNEL ARE EXCELLENT. I AM IMPRESSED WITH THE LONG GUARANTEE: I’M NOT EVEN HALF WAY THROUGH. I ALSO LOVE THE ONLINE UPDATES PROVIDED FOR MY EQUIPMENT. IT TAKES ONLY 5 MINUTES WHEN NEEDED. I’M A SUPER HAPPY CUSTOMER AND RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT WHOLE HEARTEDLY.
9,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,My Eargo 7,"The media could not be loaded.
                



I have worn Starkey hearing aid previously for 6 years. I did some research. I was having a problem hearing certain words clearly. The Eargo 7 is all it promise to be. They hold their charge, stay invisible in the ear, works with the app on the phone and the hearing test downloaded to the ear pieces. Once I changed the petals that came on the ear pieces to the medium open petals(fit my ears better) I had no more itching in the ear. Its been two weeks now. Working very well."
9,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,clean is everything,"I love my Eargo's and wouldn't know what to do without then.  They are amazing nothing comes close to Eargo.  Please don't mess with lessor products, it's a waste of your time and money."
9,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are great for me,Mild hearing loss.
9,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Comfortable,"I really like my Eargo 7s.  I knew I couldn't tolerate the kind with the big piece behind your ear, so I searched for a high quality in-the-ear canal model.  At first they felt really odd, but every day I notice them less.  This is my 2nd week of wearing them, so I expect that soon I won't notice them at all.  The sound is natural to me  and the compact charger/case makes them easy to take along.  I had been putting off trying hearing aids, and I'm glad I finally took the plunge with Eargo 7s."
9,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome help from Eargo 7's!,"I was somewhat skeptical about the claims made by Eargo. However, when I received them, all doubts disappeared. My hearing has improved dramatically with a minimal amount of adjustment to having the devices in my ear.And they are just about invisible, which is a huge plus. I highly recommend you give them a try, nothing to lose with a 30 day guarantee.As noted they are for mild to moderate hearing loss. If you're hearing loss as severe, these probably will not work for you.The two cautions I will give you are that they do take a little time to adjust to both the feel of the devices in your ear canals, and, how your voice sounds to yourself. Within two weeks I hardly noticed them, if at all. Oh, and you do have to experiment with the different settings. I like to tinker and found this to be a huge plus rather than going back and forth to an audiologist office for adjustments. Everyone is different though, so be honest with yourself before purchasing.The entire crew at Eargo have been awesome and I appreciate I have been assigned my own audiologist who has been very helpful and available by phone and by email."
9,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great hearing aids,I’m very happy with the Eargo hearing aids. I can hear the best I’ve been able to in 20 years. They were very easy to set up. I am very pleased at the sound quality while using them with my phone. I also appreciate that they are not as noticeable as traditional hearing aids and look like normal ear buds. I am very satisfied.
11,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,Trouble with return,"Product may be ok for some but didn’t work for me. I had to return them. Since I paid almost $800 for them, I needed my money back. It took several contacts to customer service and about 6 weeks but money was finally returned."
11,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,These hearing aids really work.,"Well a two week review, I like everything about these Lexie B2 Powered by BOSE hearing aids, I've had a few different pairs some cheap and some not so cheap but they all left me dissatisfied and I think I'm glad I got the B2 with replaceable batteries don't have to worry about running out of juice."
11,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Almost as good as hearing aids,"Not quite as adjustable as hearing aids (still can't buy those over the counter), but these are 1/3 of the price. Unable to adjust for high and low range and the app is slow to open but they do greatly improve my hearing and are very light and easy to use. For the price they are great."
11,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very good,Ear best
11,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great customer service,"Received my order and had an issue, which was disappointing.  However I contacted customer service, explained my issue and the response and resolution was outstanding and went above and beyond.So far I'm quite happy with my new hearing aids, hearing noises I haven't heard in years.  My wife is happy that the TV isn't so loud when were both watching.I highly recommend these if you are in need but on a budget.  And rest assured if you do have an issue the customer service department will go the extra mile to resolve it and ensure you are happy.Thanks Lexie"

11,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Won't connect to my phone for calls,"I like the sound, I don't like that they did not include connection with phone for calls, 80% of over the ear has them, size is not the issue.  To bad, it will be part of my review I'm writing for all hearing aids I'm testing"
11,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Only issue is cell phone calls cannot be heard with these OTC aids,For hearing these are the best i have used for my poor hearing but they do have short comings. They are difficult to connect to your Bluetooth on your phone. And not being able to hear my phone calls on these things is a real bummer. Would i buy again? yes but i hope these last until Bose or Lexie figure out the phone issue.in case anyone is wondering i have had 2 previous hearing aids that cost a lot of money. For hearing in all environments these work better. But the no calls on them is a real bummer.
11,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Helped with Reverse slope hearing loss,I'm so happy I bought these hearing aids. I suffer from reverse slope hearing loss and these hearing aids allowed me to increase the bass and lower the treble.  It was like a whole new world! I got them just before the holidays and was actually able to hear conversations. Increasing the bass let me hear lower tones and decreasing the treble took the screeching out of the room.. I can't say enough about them. Totally happy and would recommend them to anyone suffering with reverse slope hearing loss. Nothing is better than actual hearing  but these helped me feel like part of the party and conversations. Truly a gift.
11,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Definitely worth the price!,"I went through a few far less expensive versions of amplifiers and other hearing devices.  The whistling was a constant detraction.  These are comfortable, work well with my smartphone, and do everything they're supposed to do.  Thank you, Amazon,, for putting up with my recent returns of unsatisfactory amplifiers."
11,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Lexie B1 hearing aids are an excellent alternative to the exorbitant pricing games.-,"These $850 Bose hearing aids can rival or surpass the performance of much more expensive prescription hearing aids.  If you have mild to moderate hearing loss from aging, they can change your life, particularly in social situations or at home when a family member is tiring of having to shout to be heard or believes you are ignoring them when, in fact, you simply haven’t heard them.They do require you to “tweek” the basic settings to optimize the sound but this is fairly easy to do.  I would recommend these for anyone who can use a smart phone and/or adjust the sound on a stereo."
11,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Ok aids,"Evidently I have a hearing loss more profound than these aids were meant for. After getting them hooked up, with tech support, I still wasn’t able to hear my TV. Sadly I had to return them."
11,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not working after 5 months,There is no way to contact customer service support to either return and/or get help on hearing aid functions. There is a buzzing noise in one of the hearing aids and it does not work. Very disappointed as I thought Bose was a good quality product
11,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great Value, Price","Bought these for my mom who is extremely hard of hearing. She loved them, clarity, comfort, and so forth. Unfortunately, she has misplaced them and to date, I am unable to find them. Hope I can afford another pair for her, and want to try it myself also"
11,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,I Can Hear!!,"With having Costco hearing aids that soon stopped working and Miracle Ear no longer supporting the brand I had, I decided to try these out.  From the simplicity of using the app to set these up to now being like a normal hearing person again, I can again enjoy the missing sounds of outdoors, grandchildren having fun and the occasional ""Fore"" on the golf course!  These exceeded what my previous aids where not giving me.  Simply put - I Can Hear You!!"
11,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Improved hearing,These were not as easy to set up as expected but the customer service was exceptional. Hearing is somewhat improved but I’m still getting used to them so may need more adjustments.
11,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great service from Amazon,"The product is excellent.  The service was even better.  The first pair received had one of the pair that would not power on.  Service rep at Amazon chat asked a few questions and set up a return and replacement order on the spot.  Received replacement set next day and return of the initial set was a ""piece of cake"".  Great service. Great product."
11,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Huge, Costly Mistake! Warning to Buyers!","I have been hearing aides for almost 10 years.  My dog decided to make the ones I had an appetizer so I had to make a purchase. Product reviews looked ok, it was Bose after all.Huge mistake, 1 week in one of them started with a screeching static sound. In short, I called customer service 3 times and got no where. The last call I was told to “watch YouTube and learn how to diagnose the issue”. Getting no where, I just wanted a replacement after all, I asked to speak with a supervisor.After a 10 minute hold “Mark” came back to say she is in a meeting and can’t talk. I said to please give her my # and ask her to return my call. Mark says, “You obviously don’t realize how we do things here. You are going to need  to understand that with our company you will have to do some work too.” Honest, I couldn’t make it up.So buy at your own risk and do not count on ANY customer support, or supervisor’s apparently, from Lexie."
11,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent quality!!,"Good hearing aids, fit well and I can hear finally!!!"
11,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best hearing aids I have ever purchased,"These Bosw hearing aids are awesome!  The sound quality is what you would expect from Bose! I have had other OTC hearing aids,  but these out perform them all hands down."
11,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome,"I am very happy with the hearing aides, but happy that I ordered batteries also the pack that came with them were dead !!!"
11,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Comfortable self adjusting good quality hearing aids,I’m impressed with the value of these comfortable fitting hearing aids. I love that I can adjust the sound myself on my iPhone. 25 percent of the cost of new aids in 🇨🇦.
11,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,good value for $$$,"was fine for a few hours. removed to take a nap and when I put back in the right one wouldn't work.therefore, I returned."
11,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not for me.,"When something says BOSE, I EXPECT great quality.  No.  These are still tin sounding like amplifiers.  If I lowered the base, I had to raise the treble and with no improvement of hearing ability.  They need to work a while longer on these.  Definitely need improvement.  They are a comfortable fit, but they just don't work like I expect a hearing aid to help.  Not worth the big bucks for sure.  I sent mine back today.  I saw zero marked improvement in hearing.  This is what happens when I tried cutting corners.  Did not work for me."
11,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Volume control,The only thing I would change is that the hearing aid itself does not indicate (beep) when you use volume control.
11,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,I'm very happy with my new hearing aids!,Priced right and excellent sound quality.  Easy instructions to follow for us first time hearing aid users. Great website instructional videos covering just about everything you need to know.
11,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,Couldn’t do it,These were not terrible but not prescription quality and much more irritating to wear. I’m going to have to order some from doctor.
11,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,First try with hearing aids,These have been a pleasant surprise
11,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,I wish I had these for the past 10 years,"Almost two weeks have passed since my Lexie B1 aids arrived and I could not be happier.  They're not uncomfortable at all, and I can hear!  I am 68, and worked in a very noisy environment during my state trooper firearms instructor and siren above my head career.  Sounds that I have not perceived in years are clear to me now…the turn indicator actually makes a blinking sound, the toaster actually dings when done, and my slippers are really noisy on linoleum floors.  Ha. I have not had to utter HUH very much at all lately …had to ask the wife not to talk to me so loud, and I can hear and UNDERSTAND the dialogue on TV without closed captions.  I found that the smaller ear bits are more comfortable and efficient than the larger bits.  I purchased a dehumidifier gadget for these babies as I am going to take real good care of them, and apparently moisture is a demon to them eventually. At night before bed, in the dehumidifier they go.  I learned that if I leave the battery doors open when I take them out for the night that the batteries last quite longer.  The other evening a pleasant female voice said Low Battery in my ear which kept me from replacing batteries prematurely.  I bought a pack of 48 quality batteries for less than $20.  I put one of the smaller packs in the car in case I’m out and get a low battery warning.  It is important to leave the battery door open with a fresh battery for 5 minutes before closing and using the aids, in order to substantially increase battery life.  The iPhone app is great and easy to use…sometimes they might not connect but simply recycling the Bluetooth on the phone sorts that issue out.  I only need the app if there is a significant sound environment change. I was in an auditorium last night at an eulogy and could easily hear and understand the speakers rather than just a lot of roar background sound around me.  I was surprised to learn that I have to ADD some bass in the sound adjustment to keep things from sounding tinny.  Bass has been my enemy for a while but no more.  I wish I had been able to use these for the past ten years, as I have obviously missed a lot in conversation and surroundings.  I am impressed with the quality and support.  After all, they’re Bose!  Color me ecstatic."
11,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,"VERY COMFORTABLE, EXCELLENT SOUND","Only had the hearing aids for about a week.  Fit is excellent, more comfortable than the aids I had personal molds made for.  Best I have experienced.  Various settings - restaurant, etc. - work better than I ever imagined.  These Lexie hearing aids could not be much better (the app running through my smart phone is not used too often but works very well.  I chose the replaceable battery type of aid simply because I HATE rechargeables.  Now the bad - if this could be classified as ""bad"" - my aids are not loud enough even at the highest level.  Watching TV, for example, I set the aids at maximum and still have to turn the TV volume up 20 clicks (out of 100).  Normal volume setting for our home is 42 and I need at least 62 to 70. This has never happened to me.  Even the really cheap $25. aids had a volume setting too high for me.Addition:  So I sent in my aids for repair (the little door you place the battery on broke on both aids.  Many weeks after sending in the aids I finally managed to talk with someone from Lexie, complaining it has been weeks and I have heard nothing.  First response, after the silly, ""I'm sorry ..."" ""What are serial numbers of your hearing aids?""  Serial number? I'm told such information accompanied the aids in the original package.  I have the outer package and the pieces of paper about the aids but nothing with serial numbers.  The storage box was sent back with the aids. ""Sorry sir.  We have the information on you and your repair request but can't do anything for you without the serial numbers.""  I now sit, once again waiting for a company tech department - which ignored me for weeks - to get back to me.  Good aids but service?  So far it stinks and, I would not purchase their product again for that reason.  An aside.  I have a very serious problem with balance.  Without hearing aids and meds, and special glasses I can't walk more than 30 or so feet without falling down.  Really falling down which includes passing out for an instant - 3 to 4 seconds - and usually requires a day or two in a hospital.  I have been all but house bound since I sent my aids in for a simple repair.  I would have paid for them to be fixed (with steady hands I believe it would have taken 10 minutes per aid).  But I spent the $9.00 to mail them back to Lexie where they have apparently fallen into a black hole.Addition 2.  Talk with Lexie every day and they still haven't returned the aids.  I believe they can't find them!  Almost every call includes Lexie asking for more informaton - serial numbers, address to which aids sent for repair, etc.  Can't they look in their records and tell me they have my aids or they don't?  Now I am I am being informed the case has been elevated to the ""supervisory"" level and I will get a call back.  Been told that three or four times.  Every day I call Lexie.  They have never call me - they ssay my phone is set to block their number.  Review of phone doesn't show any blocked numbers.  More to follow?"
11,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Crappiest bluetooth pairing I've ever seen,"Sound is good. Pairing with the app is absolutely awful.Instead of fixing their app, they give you directions in the manual that go something like, ""Are you having more trouble pairing with our app than you have had with any other bluetooth device in the known universe? Try this:1. Take off your hearing aids and open the battery compartments.2. Close the app.3. Shut down your phone.4. Walk outside were everyone can hear you, and belt two choruses of Dolly Parton's ""Nine To Five"" at the top of your lungs.5. Go back inside. Do three jumping jacks. Not two, not four ... just three.6. Close the battery compartments.7. Reboot your phone. While it's booting, cross yourself, then recite three Hail Marys and an Our Father, even if you're not Catholic. It can't hurt.8. Close your battery covers and put the devices in your ears. Do the left one first, or they will never pair again.9. Open the app.10. Hope they pair. If they don't, return to step one above.Hey Lexie ............. FIX. YOUR. APP.  You've got about 10 days to do that before these things get sent back to Amazon."
11,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very good hearing aids!,"One of my $3000+ hearing aids just stop working.  Though they were insured, that insurance did not cover repair.  Just to have them looked at would have cost $250 per hearing aid, as well as audiologist appointment, and then the cost of repairs.  These hearing aids, powered by BOSE, are amazing!  They are better than my old prescription hearing aids in so many ways!  First, the sound quality is excellent!  They are comfortable!  I LOVE that I can adjust the sound level as well as the treble and bass, and I can adjust for environments and directionally! None of that was possible with my Widex hearing aids.  In fact, to adjust the sound level required a visit to the audiologist, a new hearing test, and then they adjust the level.  I know because I just had this done in July.  And then, the volume was uncomfortably high, so to fix it would have required another visit to the audiologist.  These Lexie hearing aids are easy to adjust, on my phone, as I wish!!!  Honestly, I am SO pleased!!!  Feeling very grateful!"
11,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Good start for OTC, yet seems a bit overpriced for what you get","The good - you can adjust for different volume levels in each ear;; You can adjust global treble vs. base level;; you can program it by connecting to your cell phone with bluetooth;; you can save environment profiles;;The bad - No adjustment on treble - base for each ear;; the ""battery low"" warning is a loud and distracting voice rather than a discrete chirp;; The battery dies without a ""power down"" chime and then the hearing device emits an odd 'shoop' noise after it has stopped working, but battery is apparently not quite dead.;; These burn through batteries quickly (about every 3 days) compared to similar Oticon hearing aids at about every 7 days.;; on-device adjustment is for volume which should NOT be changed on a whim for optimal hearing health;; adjustment between environments is very inconvenient, requiring using a connected cell phone - This switch between environments should be on the device itself.  (How many of us can -- or want --to mess around with our phones when we're changing environments many times a day and sometimes in situations when cell phones are prohibited??).  Aids handle high frequency sounds poorly - sometimes with a loud screech;; devices are poor for hearing those close to you in noisy inside environments, like a trivia night;; only one color is offered - gray (who has gray skin??)  So, this is a good start for an OTC hearing aid and it is cheaper than a prescription set of aids, yet it seems a bit over priced for its performance and design. On-device environment switches, device shut down with chime when battery is too low for operation, better handling of high frequency sounds, better handling of background sounds in noisy environments, and a more user friendly low battery notice would be a great improvements."
11,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,Big Disappointment,"I recently lost one of my two prescription hearing aids and decided to give OTCs a try. After researching several and reading the mixed reviews on these, I decided to give them a try. First, the pros.These are very well made. I was impressed with the quality of the packaging, the simple set up, the look and comfort of the hearing aids, and the instructions for wearing them. The sound quality was as good as my prescription hearing aids. I could tell a difference in the sound when I added bass, adjusted the volume or the balance. At first, I was very optimistic. Then the problems started. Now, the cons.They turned themselves off on a couple of occasions. The first time, I thought I might have done something. The second time, no. I was watching TV and realized they weren't working. They had turned themselves off. The volume and balance features wouldn't always work. One morning I was sitting near a wind chime and the tone of the wind chine was causing my right hearing aid to squeal loudly, so I muted it. But it didn't mute. I tried several times, and it would not mute. I tried to change the balance level to zero. That didn't work. I wound up taking it out of my ear.In summary, If the connectivity issues with the Bluetooth could be resolved, these would be excellent hearing aids and I would still have them. The deciding factor for me choosing these over the others was the ability to control them from my phone. And that simply is not reliable. In fact, it was unreliable enough that I returned them after about a week. And there's another pro. I was able to return them for a full refund, hassle-free and with no questions."
11,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product quality,Easy to use. Perfect for what I need.  I am borderline and so the doctor wouldnt offer a prescription for hearing aids.  I decided to find my own option.  These work great. They highlight the sound within the crowd. I no longer miss conversations
11,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,The best hearing aids I've tried,"I've had hearing aids of many types and cost levels.  These are by far the best.  Setting the volume, balance and bass/treble was easy.  The biggest problem I had with other hearing aids is that they do not fit and come out of the ear canal.  My first one was fitted by by casting by an audiologist and would not stay in my ear no matter how I tried to jam it into my ear canal.  A later set was an OTC purchase.  when I tried to get some other styles of buds, I found out they had NO product support.  Lexie called me after a week without calling them.  I reported no problem.I did not like a lot of music growing up because I could not understand the lyrics.  Now I can enjoy listening to '50's and '60's music like never before.  It was not the amplification I needed, It was a correction of the frequencies."
11,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Could be me but...,Having difficulty syncing it to my phone
11,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Hearing Aids Work Well ...,...but the app does not connect to
11,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Lexi B1 OTC Hearing Aids,"The hearing aids fit well, and may work for someone who does NOT have PROFOUND hearing loss. I bought these for my wife who has PROFOUND hearing loss.I do not remember seeing “anywhere” in the description of this product where it said ANYTHING about not being recommended for people with PROFOUND hearing loss.The hearing aids are very slim, and fit well, with very little to no sound leakage. But they were a pain in the BACKSIDE to pair with my wife’s phone.So what did we learn today from this review? If you have PROFOUND hearing loss don’t waste your time or money with this product.IF you have LESS than PROFOUND hearing loss, they are made by BOSE! I have many different BOSE products and the sound quality is wonderful.So be careful. READ everything on the subject of the product.And IF the information is not complete enough for you. Then please ask the seller, the manufacturer, or whoever you need to get your information."
11,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,I can hear!,they arrived on time so far I’m pleased with them. They seem to work. The app was easy. Will update later.
11,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,This product works the same as professional ones,This product is less than a quarter of what the ones purchased from a doctor's office costs.  Work and feel just as good and you can adjust them with a phone app instead of having to visit the doctor to have them adjusted.
11,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,They help hearing but don't expect perfection.,"The app was easy to install on my IPhone. The app allows you to control the volume and bass/treble settings as well as environment you are in. In noisy indoor environment setting it seems it just drops volume and doesn't make hearing any better. I just use standard ""everyday"" setting most of the time.  The battery does seem to drain quickly and there is a voice reminder saying ""battery low"" thru the hearing aid. The receiver wire coil from the hearing aid into your ear is shorter than my previous hearing aids but it does job. The manual does give info on getting the correct size receiver wire coil but I didn't follow thru on that yet.  Overall so far so good but not as good as my Phonak brand aids from Costco that cost alot more."
11,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Update to Did not last,"Update:  I contacted Customer Support and the person said he would send a email with an address where I could return the hearing aids for repair.  After waiting two weeks for the email (which did not come), I called Customer Support again, and this time I got a very proficient person.  She sent a email while we were talking, and waited until she was sure I got it.  I returned the hearing aids to the Minnesota address she gave me.  From there, everything moved like clockwork.  Great support.  So far, so good!  I changed my rating from one star to three stars.Side note - Both Support personnel had heavy foreign accents and were hard to understand, especially with my hearing loss.  I had them repeat each statement until I understood it completely.I purchased the hearing aids in July, 2023.  They were great while they worked, but the right one completely died in December, 2023, and the left one is threatening to follow suit.  I WOULD NOT recommend this product!!"
11,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,"You get what you paid for, no more","Decent features of Lexie B1s:1. Easy to adjust volume without app2. Good fit for most ears3. Helpful telephone support4. High quality storage case5. Support for asymmetric amplification between left and right ears6. Support for two sound directionality sources, front and everywhereFeatures that Lexie B1s don't have but should:1. Bluetooth playthrough - This would help with phone calls, listening to music, etc.2. Waterproof enough to shower and occasionally get wet (Don't really need for swimming, just enough for other wet occasions)3. Ability to adjust environment and other settings when there is no internet connectivity4. Searchable text for support questions5. Audio feedback when using the volume switch on the devicesItem #3 above, if you put your phone in airplane mode, you will not be able to use the application until you restore internet connectivity.Sure it would be nice if these were really hearing aids, but the price would go much higher. These are hearing amplifiers and NOT hearing aids. Hearing aids allow the user to amplify only the frequencies they have trouble hearing. Even though there is a tradeoff between treble and base, the Lexie devices amplify all frequencies. The OTC law allows companies to blur the distinction between Hearing Aids and Hearing amplifiers. The Lexie devices are hearing amplifiers.Lastly, the identity of Bose is meaningless. Bose helps sales but does not add features that help you follow a conversation in a noisy environment."
11,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Wanted to love these but unfortunately returned.,"Received these two hours after I ordered them from Amazon. Delivery was amazing and opened them immediately and began the installation process.  Followed the quick instructions as instructed, unfortunately the Lexie app installed on my phone (Samsung Note 9) but would not open no matter how many times it was installed or uninstalled and reapplied.  Spent an hour on the phone with customer support and they could not help me and said they would call me back the next day after discussing with their IT department.  As expected, that call never materialized. Also spent 5 hours trying everything possible to get them to work.  So, they were packed up and returned the next day.  One exception, the app installed on my Samsung tablet, and I was super impressed with the sound quality from these hearing aids, but they would not stay connected via the Bluetooth.  So, every time I wanted to make an adjustment, I had to open the battery case and reclose to get it to work.  Since I don't carry my tablet, it would be useless because you wouldn't be able to make the necessary adjustments for the scenario you were in.  Another thing I found interesting when I opened the product, the outer security seal on the outer wrap had been broken and open when I received the product so I can only guess that it had been sold and returned by someone else along the way.  I was impressed with what I could hear when they worked for the brief time I got them up and running, but hardly worth all the obstacles for me."
11,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,They corroded after seven months and were not covered by the warranty.,"The short story: Do not buy them! After 7 months of use my Lexie B1 corroded and stopped working (although I had been using an airdrier). Lexie refused to honor the warranty. Thankfully I own a second pair (Phonak) and didn't have to spend the almost 30 day ordeal with Lexie without hearingaids. This second pair, by the way, does not have corrosion problems.The long story: After 7 months my Lexie B1 stopped working. I called customer support and was asked to purchase a new connection wire. After this failed, I was asked to replace the second wire which alse didn't work. At my third attempt I was told that there was no record of me, at which point I sent a screenshot of my Amazon purchase and was 'allowed' to send them in (on my nickel). Lexie refused to honor the warranty on the grounds that humidity had caused the errosion. I told them that I had used an airdryer every day, but that seemd to make no difference to their assessment.  After another call I suggested that I shouldn't pay for the repair since I had already purchased the cables. They agreed and sent them back to me (they arrived about two weeks after the negotiation).Now, they still are not working. I am not sure I have the time and the frustration tolerance to go through it all again."
11,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,6 weeks in and just WOW!,"I'm a hearing aid customer for 11 years now. I have owned the 8000.00 aids twice. My second pair gave up a few months ago. I started looking into my third set and just checked them out on Amazon and found the pricing much better as you could guess. I'm 69 years old and Money is a little different right now. I like the way the drivers are in the ear and not through an air tube as my 8000.00 set were. all of my supplies work with these aids. I love the fact that I can EQ them from my phone and change the diminutions that I have to hear in from it as well. A graphics equalizer would have been cool, but because you can adjust the while hearing through them makes it easy to adjust frequency with a slide of the button so really no big deal. I LOVE these units and they are every thing I would expect with BOSE on the side of them. I have had BOSE equipment for sound since in high School, I completely recommend them, the battery life is about 4 days and that out lived my other costly aids. If your new to this world take your time and understand your hearing things you have missed for a long time. Keep the volume down so you do not get overwhelmed at first, you will get there quickly I promise. Thanks for a great product and a company that delivers very fast (the next day in my case). I hear a lot about customer service here but have not had even the slightest reason to bug them."
11,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not Worth The Money,"Just nowhere near as good as the 1400 dollar ones I had from Costco.  Hearing just doesn't measure up, ask my wife she's not happy with them either.  Thought I could save some money and found out sometimes you really do get what you paid for.  I've been wearing hearing aids for over 20 years, I'm heading back to Costco where the product is good and the support is always there.  Just one man's opinion...Good luck to all...Tim O"
11,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Pleased,I am extremely pleased with my purchase of Bose powered hearing aids (B1 by Lexie).  My previous ones cost over $4000 and did not perform nearly as well as these. One disappointment I do have is the accessories are what I consider high compared to similar items on line at Amazon.
11,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,great product,"I am very pleased with the results. Life is definitely markedly improved. The Lexie/Bos product works quite well and was recommended this product by my audiologist. You must, however, take time to read all the instructions to fully acclimate yourself even before opening the packages. The bluetooth works only as well as your internet connectivity. Additionally, it doesn't work at all for the television -- to Lexie's credit, they are quite transparent about this limitation.  Another problem is that you can't turn both aides off at the same time. Nonetheless, despite these limitations, for what you pay this is a darn good product."
11,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,Buyer Beware: Poor functioning app is serious detriment to these OTC Hearing Aids,"For years I had ""prescription"" hearing aids. I was frustrated by the need to go back to the professional to make changes to the aids settings. Lexie talks about their convenient phone app to easily make those adjustments on your own. But there is one very frustrating problem with them - I have an iPhone with the latest ios installed. And EVERY DAY i place the Lexie aids into my ears and feel I would like to adjust them regarding settings, I must POWER OFF MY PHONE AND THEN RESTART IT in order to make the app recognize my hearing aids - ON THEIR OWN APP.!!! I have complained to Lexie, and was told they are aware of it, but I have no idea when or if they will fix this problem. So while the hearing aids themselves seem to be a decent product and buy, I would not recommend them to anyone at this point. The frustration of the need to power down and restart your phone every time you feel the need to make an adjustment, via THEIR OWN App, is a serious strike against one of their most important selling points. LEXIE MUST FIX THIS PROBLEM.... 1/26/23 Update: Lexie has acknowledged that they are having bluetooth connectivity problems, and state that they are working on the app. For iPhone users such as myself, I continue to only be able to access the Lexie app each day by completely turning off and then restarting my iPhone. It is frustrating, and my biggest concern is ""what if even this app access- ability becomes broken, and all I am left with is the on-earphone volume controls...."". If that does occur, I suppose all I can do is request a refund as the product would clearly not perform as advertised.  I will update when/if app gets fixed and works properly, but still cannot recommend purchase of these hearing aids due to unacceptable app access for proper adjustment of them - at least for iPhone users."
11,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,Great product if only both worked,"Received the aids promptly. Tried them on, noticed excess feedback and a ticking in one of the hearing aids only. Tried to trouble shoot with no luck so I contacted Amazon, and they put me in contact with the company, who ran diagnostics and determined one of them was faulty. I was told they’d send me another pair and I followed the instructions. Then spent the next 40 days trying to coordinate a new pair. Then they changed their mind and wanted me to send my old ones back which I contacted them 3 times for but got phone call from the amazon Bose store representative and the separate Bose company representative who did not seem to have had any communication about the hearing aids status. At one point they were coming, at another they were waiting for me to send the old ones back. I basically just lived with one working hearing aid for 40 days. Finally tried to send it back to Amazon and they told me they couldn’t give me a full refund so spent quite a bit of time dealing with that being on hold for a few hours and finally got them sent back and got my money back. Decided to just go with another company for my hearing aids. They’re not as good of quality but honestly I’d rather be able to hear a little less well in both ears then hear superbly well in only one ear and have to deal with Bose customer service anymore. Bought a second pair thinking, must have been fluke the first time….nope left hearing aid stopped working after a month, still can’t return them. I’m out $750 on these and would have been more useful to buy $300 hearing amplifiers at this point. Save your money, buy actually hearing aids from a reputable seller. These are not Bose standard of hearing devices"
11,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,Very bad feed back noise,"I bought this mainly for the price and the brand associated with it. Rather than paying about $3000, this was the only $1000. The hearing aid had functioned ok over the last year. But the biggest problem has been the very loud feed back whistle when there’s something moving around the hearing aid, like my hands. The sound is so loud that people around me can hear it! I tried to use different size domes, with and without holes, making sure my ears are free of wax etc. but nothing helped!Well I guess you get what you paid for, as the saying goes."
11,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,I'm keeping these and getting some for my wife!,"These are the fourth set of OTC ""hearing aids"" in the past few months. Not sure they'll let me say what brands they were . . . but they all got sent back for various reasons. I got these today and only had them in my ears about 3 hours when I decided to write this review. They are superior in every way. Better feeling fit. Better sound quality. Ease of adjusting using their app. ""Invisible"" to see. I can tell already that I'm keeping these and getting some for my wife! I've been researching and shopping for OTC hearing aids for many months. I've known for years that I needed some kind of hearing assistance. Saying ""HUH?"" was no longer working! (lol) I took several on line hearing tests with my headphones and was determined I have severe hearing loss. Not sure how accurate those tests are because I had my wife take the same test and was also deemed to have ""severe"" hearing loss. Just a way to sell product I think. I have not had a test from an audiologist, but having played guitar professionally for many years knew I had trouble hearing. Was NOT going to pay audiologist prices! As a musician I put sound quality at the top of my list of required features. I can already tell that these hearing aids do the trick! I prefer the model with batteries over the chargeable, so I got these. I'll wear them for a few weeks and see, but I can't imagine not liking them. Will update later to let y'all know how they are doing."
11,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,They make a difference,I was a little skeptical on whether my hearing would benefit from hearing aids but I have to say these help.Some good things:* the app adjustment features are good. The forward facing selection is very useful.* if you have tinnitus they don’t eliminate it but it helps.A few things I wish were different.* I wish they charged in the case* having to open the battery chamber when not in use to save the batteries seems a little cheesy. Batteries last about a day.* if you wear glasses they can make the hearing aids a little more unstable* the app loads slow.
11,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,I waited 2 months to write this review,"I have been using this product for 2 months now. You might see in other reviews that connection to the phone app is a problem. Well it is a pain and can take a few tries but I have never not connected. Be patient. Sound is good to excellent even in crowded groups like Christmas parties. Tone control seems to be my best adjustment but volume can be important to control squealing when item are near the ears. Sorry I should have mentioned that I have a slight loss in one ear and moderate loss in the other. I have found having replaceable batteries to be a plus as you always have fresh power whereas recharging you never know and I have had rechargeable batteries just dies after a few months. Yes I do recommend these, a bit pricey but I think it is reasonable value."
11,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice quality, not enough compression or control","Nice build quality. App connects easily and consistently. Volume and tone control are very easy to use, however don't really grant enough control. I wanted a compression control too -- loud sounds (ex. dishes and doors) are over amplified. Returned them and ended up getting Start Hearing One (google it), which were nearly identical but work better overall for less cost."
11,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,An expensive disappointment. I will keep them as backups.,"I already have a pair of the original Lexie Lumen hearing aids. I presumed that these, which are manufactured by my favorite audio products manufacturer Bose, would be an improvement. They're not. I find that I can follow conversations better when I am using my Lexie Lumen hearing aids. Using these, I miss a lot of words. This is after extensive adjustments and attempts at fine-tuning. For day-to-day use I have gone back to my Lexie Lumen hearing aids, and I'll use these as backups."
11,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Better than my $6,000 pair!","I love these!!  I had a hard time understanding accents with my $6,000 pair, but by self adjusting these (as in the manual) and increasing the treble I could understand much better.  I can't even feel them while they are in my ears and frequently touch my ears to make sure they are still there.  In a store today I kept looking around because I clearly heard noise and talking that I didn.t see."
11,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Uses batteries in 4-5 days,Batteries used faster than I would have thought. Otherwise excellent.
11,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,He is Happy,"Bought these for my husband. I love them, he can hear me. Sound quality is good, but there is a learning curve. After thousands of dollars spent on “hearing aids and doctors”, he had these up and running on his own. We are not computer geeks, so it was amazing how quickly he had them set up. Highly recommend this product. He recommends that you really read the directions..😁"
11,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Nice small quality hearing aids,The app for these hearing aids is sporadic at best but does eventually connect with the hearing aids.
11,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,The most unhelpful customer service / support,"I purchased the Lexi Bose hearing aid with high hopes, but unfortunately, the right side aid started to give me problems in less than a week. It would not charge, connect to the app, or function properly. When I contacted customer support for help, I was met with an extremely rude and unhelpful agent who told me to take it up with Amazon. This experience has left me extremely disappointed with the product and the customer service.I expected much better from Bose, and it's a shame that they put their name on such a defective product. I would not recommend this hearing aid to anyone, and I regret my purchase. It's frustrating to spend a significant amount of money on a product that doesn't work, and to receive such poor customer service when seeking assistance. Save yourself the trouble and look elsewhere for a hearing aid that actually functions and is supported by a company that cares about their customers."
11,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,Sound quality was sub par for my hearing loss. Requested support. Non received,They requested a copy of the purchase emailed to them for follow up service. I sent it the same day and never heard back from them. I followed up with another letter asking for acknowledgement but that too was ignored.The hearing aid appeared well made and packaging was very professionally done but the hearing aids do not made speech clear enough to understand for my hearing loss. Also there is annoying feedback squeal when putting them in and removing them from my ears. The iPhone app is hit or miss.
11,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Lexie B1,Hearing Aid seems to work fine. The APP is very slow and questionable.
11,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Better than all the others I've tried,"My wife has expensive custom fitted Beltone hearing aids, and has tried 3 cheap ones (@ $250) here on Amazon.  She likes these better than any of those, including the Beltones.  You can get replacement wires and earbuds from Lexie.  Keep them away from your dog.... learned the hard way"
11,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,good hearing aids,"EasyPut in batteries and put them in my ears and they worked. Not so easySetting up Lexie app. Had to contact support but after about 20 minutes we got the app to work.Customer support person called me back and was very knowlegable.I had to clean out my bluetooth and reset, then re download the Lexie app"
11,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,BEST HEARING AIDS AFTER YEARS,"These hearing aids are excellent!! There are no difficulties or challenges. The app is very easy to work with, and it includes a sound and a treble/bass dial which allows for personalized results. After years of experimenting with hearing aids, this is the best one I found!"
11,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,If theses had streaming Bluetooth Audio they would be better than my prescription Oticon aids,The sound quality is almost as good as my very expensive prescription Oticon hearing aids. The directionality/noise reduction features are better than Oticon. Bluetooth connectivity to a phone requires Bluetooth to be turned off/on sometimes (but not a big deal). If these aids had streaming Bluetooth Audio I would give 5 stars and would use the Lexie Aids more than my prescription Oticon hearing aids. Good value when compared to expensive prescriptions.
11,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Okay for OTC,"I bought these to replace a set of aids from an audiologist that were 7+ years old. I didn’t have the money to go back so decided to try these out instead.Fit: fit is fine, I do have some trouble with ear buds fitting as I do a lot of video calls and over the head phones are not an option.Sound: sound is clear but difficult to adjust for the right setting and to adjust with the app is slow.App: sometimes the app takes forever to connect. You have to close out of everything and then restart the app to connect most times. It’s not a quick adjustment process.If I didn’t need something to replace my old ones, I would consider a different set."
11,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,A real hearing aid not some sound amplifier!,"Small comfortable and easy to use. The only thing I would add is the ability to adjust the sound via a graphic equalizer on the app. Volume, treble, bass and microphone direction are all easy to adjust and understand and the 4 preprogrammed environments are great but maybe a hearing test with automatic adjustments would be a great addition to a near perfect reasonably priced product. You will not go wrong buying these. Update. One of the RIC tubes failed after less than 40 days. Since I bought it through Amazon I had to request a refund thru Amzon. I would hope that the RIC earpieces dont fail that frequently as they cost $50 from Lexi and are supposed to last a year."
11,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Hearing again,I didn’t know my friend’s clock ticked!  Great for group settings. Listening to tv with the volume lowered from 98 to 40!  Adjusting with my phone. Wish I would have bought the one with charging case. The little batteries don’t last long.
11,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,As good as my $1800.00 hearing aids from 6 years ago,"Being able to adjust them myself is huge advantage.  I am adding on to this review due to failure of one of the hearing aids after only 5 weeks of service.  Tried all the suggestions new batteries, tried to connect to Lexie app, tried deleting app and reinstalling but no success. After contacting Lexie their only suggestion was to connect to a Lexie expert. What a joke.  After spending about 60 minutes on hold over 3 days I give up. I’m just going to chalk one up to zero customer service.  The aid worked very well at first but if there is a problem you’re on your own. I recommend against these due to no customer service. My old hearing aids I could could just walk in drop them off at their store and in a few days have them back in working order. There is great value in having local store to go to and I’ll be going back to see them."
11,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,What a difference!,"I have been battling tinnitus for several years, tried every pill and nothing works very well. First about a year ago I got the  Bose sleep buds that help mask the tinnitus so I can sleep but that does not help during the day. I read that some tinnitus sufferers had good results with hearing aids adjusted to their hearing. Not wanting to spend several thousand dollars just to try I came across these Lexie powered by Bose. I was not confident that these would work but decided to try anyway. Wow, Wow, Wow! My life has changed.I did not know that I could not hear so many things. My wife is happy as I do not ask what she said all the time.I hear little things like the beeper on the microwave that I could not hear unless right in front of it.My tinnitus while still there is in the background and I do not hear it unless I listen for it.In the morning before I put the hearing aids in the tinnitus reminds me in a short while.For me these are great, I am not a doctor or hearing professional just a person getting older."
11,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not enough volume,Volume control not an issue . The total db increase not sufficient . MDHearing  has more then I need in volume . Still using them .
11,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Quality product,"Quality product, very user friendly"
11,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,DO NOT PURCHASE until you have had an audiology exam/test,"I though these units might help a recent hearing loss in one ear. I made the error of thinking that I didn't need testing to see how great my hearing loss is. While the hearing aids MAY HELP minor hearing loss, they do nothing but increase the irritation of amplified sound if hearing loss is moderate to severe (which mine is). My advice is to get an audiology test FIRST, then go from there.The return to Amazon has been a nightmare. Starting with the return label from an OFFICIAL UPS Store, I had nothing to track the return package except the UPS tracking number. I was never able to determine the class of service the return package was receiving, but I do know that it took over a week to make its way out of Ontario CA (a UPS Hub) enroute to Amazon's Las Vegas Return Center. I received a verified delivery receipt from UPS saying they delivered the package on 9/13/23 @ 7:30 PM. I can drive to Las Vegas in a day. UPS and Amazon team up to deliver a return IN 9 days with no official acknowledgement from AMAZON that they received the item. Then comes the phone ""Help"" BS with the return and no one ever answered the question: ""HAVE YOU RECEIVED MY RETURN."" -- not even their HELP TEAM headquartered in a non-USA country. This whole incident prompted me NEVER TO DO BUSINESS with Amazon again. PURE, UNADULTERATED crooked business model. EVER!!!!! Fortunately, I used a majorcredit card for this $900 purchase and they have gone to bat for me. We'll see. Will update if possible."
11,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,mainly the sound and blue tooth,first off the only way to get the get the blue tooth to connect is remove the battery's every time as for the sound if its something besides a voice you get a ringing first but i have just had them 1 day so i will keep playing with them to see if i can get them adjusted to work properly. I will give another review later to see if things get better.up datewell i have tried all the settings if i turn the the TV up to around 50 i can hear it environment sounds no good people talking normal can not understand have to ask them to repeat or speak up. I have spoke with the LEXIE group or supplier but sorry to say  they could not help but were very nice.
11,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,I like them,"Besides being comfortable, i sometimes  forget I’m wearing them and they definitely improved my hearing. But the feature I like the most is the Bluetooth connectivity.  The app connects flawlessly. I can do some customization but being able to adjust the volume, bass and treble is a great feature using the phone during a conversation without going to my ears and pushing buttons. The only thing I wish it could do is be able to use the app on my iPad and phone. You can connect on one or the other but not both. I bought them not knowing what they would be like but the Bose name helped me choose. I really thought I would be returning them within the trial period but I’m satisfied.  The bluetooth feature has me hooked. I also like the battery powered ones not the rechargeable so I can replace the battery easily when I’m in a hurry."
11,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Proceed with caution,"The Lexie B1 hearing aids have many good features.  These include replacable batteries (size 312) which in my experience with other hearing aids, last a week.  They also fit pretty well and the setup app worked as advertised.  However, while the right hearing aid worked well, the left was DOA.  I had purchased these as ""backups"" for a fairly similar, but much more expensive set of hearing aids.  I decided that a dead hearing aid out of the box was not something I wanted to deal with, and also that it did not bode well for future reliability, so I returned them."
11,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,THIS IS NOT A BLUE TOOTH HEARING AID,"The description, states that this is ""Blue Tooth Enabled"".  I suppose that ""technically"" that is correct.  They do connect to the Lexie app on my phone using Blue Tooth technology.  It only took me about 20 minutes to download the app and make the connections.  The app allowed me to raise and lower the volume (which you can do on the aids themselves (I'm not going to pull out my phone every time I want to raise or lower the volume).  You can also switch between the two functions (world & forward) to be more (or less) specific directionally.  However, I couldn't get them to play music, podcasts, or answer my phone.  Ten more minutes of research in the booklet (which comes in the box) I found my answer.  In the small print buried around page 50 there is an * and a note, stating specifically that these hearing aids will NOT connect to your phone through Blue Tooth.  The only thing that works through Blue Tooth is their own app for ""adjustments"".Total waste of my time and money.  They're going right back."
11,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,"No more ""What?""","I had some old VA hearing aids, but those died long ago.  They used to drain batteries and were constantly beeping in my ear, need a new battery.  PLUS, I heard all the conversations behind me and not in front of me.  WOWZA!  These are tunable, and you can hide the conversation behind you and focus on the one infront of you.  The noise canceling is amazing.  And the best part is, ""No more What's?"""
11,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound,"I’ve been wearing hearing aids for a few decades  I had thought my hearing might be too poor for an OTC aid to help. But, having lost both of my $6000 aids (in the space of 10 days), I decided to give these a try. I am quite happy with these Lexie/Bose aids. I do wish connecting to Bluetooth was less fussy. I find it works better if I turn the phone’s bluetooth off, then on before using the app to connect."
11,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Costly after trail period,These hearing aides work pretty well but not perfect. The sound quality is a bit harsh and not great at high frequencies. These aides will be on the expensive side to maintain as they will charge for everything needed to keep them maintained including receivers and wire at $50 per side. There are other items that cost also.
11,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,A great uy.,"When my daughter showed me a rating for the Lexi in Consumer Reports, I decided to try it.  I bought the""next one up"", the Bose system, B 1.  I am extremely satisfied.  My son-in-law helped me set up the app.  I like the flexibility. (In a meeting, I was not hearing a ""soft"" speaker:  using the app, I just turned it up a few notches.  For my needs, they are just what I needed."
11,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,DON'T LOSE THEM!,I bought these last December and they worked ok. I did have some issues with adjusting them to the right volume but it was ok. On with the big issue DON'T LOSE THEM!! If you bought them thru Amazon and called Lexie to get a replacement they will direct you back to Amazon and if you bought the Asurion warranty and not the actual Lexie warranty from the website you can forget it! They will not replace them if you lost them! It has to be a defect! That's what the standard Lexie warranty is for the 1st year! You would have to pay $300 & $96(insurance fee)to get another set of hearing aids!!  I'm still paying for the ones I lost(3 months left)!! What was the point of paying for insurance!! RIDICULOUS!! Soooo!! I guess I'm not going to be able to hear!!
11,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Great hearing aid, poor customer service","I bought these hearing aids 6 months ago and they were excellent until last week when one of them developed constant static. It's like listening to a radio station that is not tuned in properly.After a week of trying things suggested by Lexie support they concluded that I must send them in for evaluation to determine whether it is something that is covered by warranty. This will take a few weeks during which I will not have hearing aids. I told them that I bought hearing aids because I need them, not as a luxury item that I can do without for a few weeks, but they did not care, nor show any sign of understanding or being sympathetic. If they determine that the issue is not covered by warranty I will need to pay for return shipping or they will keep them.I asked to speak with a manager but that was not an option.VERY DISAPPOINTING customer support!EDIT!!I just received an email with instructions to return the hearing aids for evaluation to determine whether the issue is covered under warranty and was informed that if they determine that it is not covered that I will be responsible to pay for the labor associated with the evaluation plus the return shipping, with no indication how much the evaluation might cost.AMAZING!!"
11,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Almost Perfect,The sound quality of these is excellent. easy to use and fits great.Batteries only last 1 month and they kept telling me the Batteries are low. I didn't know how to cancel the notice.The volume control is hard to work when they are on your ear.It seems like a small price to pay for the Price and quality of these Hearing Aids
11,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Not used,",I was worked that they wouldn't work for me
11,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Hear this...!,The Lexie hearing aids are perfect. They are easy to use and fit comfortably in my ears and they are truly invisible...the connection with bluetooth is very helpful.
11,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Left ear would not work,"Product was reasonably priced, comfort was satisfactory but hearing ability not accomplished."
11,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Sorely disappointed.,"I have only owned these hearing aids for about three months.  They keep cutting out and I have Bluetooth connectivity issues constantly.  Customer service reps are nice enough, but they can't resolve the problem.  I had to send the hearing aids to them at my own expense so they could ""update the firmware.""  When I finally got them back, they worked for about a week.  I am still having problems and the company will not replace them as they are now out of warranty.  I expected much better when I paid $850 for the Bose name."
11,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,There are great when they work.,The ability to work is low.
11,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Lexie B1 Bose Hearing Aids are great.,"Great fitting, great sounds, works as advertised."
11,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Should Have Bought Long Ago,"Easy to use. Behind the ear, but small and barely visible."
11,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,Poor sound in crowded environments,"These hearing aids have a good sound, but cannot really be adjusted to individual hearing loss.  After using them for 6 months I have decided to put them away and have ordered a different brand.  Unfortunately it is too late to get my money back."
11,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Charge for wires for new hearing aids.,The hearing aids are wonderful but when I ordered another set of wires  I understood they would be free but was told they would be $10.00 because I ordered the hearing aids through Amazon.
11,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Superior quality for the price.,Excellent quality for the price. Equal to or better than my $4200 prescription aids.Love being able to adjust the settings with the app to suit my hearing condition and also able to adjust to varying environments.
142,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great hearing aid,"The pictures don’t show it but this is a hearing amplifier and works pretty well, it doesn’t replace hearing aids but it works well for someone who may have some minor hearing loss."
142,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,happy with this hearing aid,The hearing aid is very easy to use. My grandparent was able to figure out how to use it without any help from me. My grandparent says that they don't even notice it's there most of the time. The hearing aid has definitely improved my grandparent's hearing. They can now hear conversations and sounds that they couldn't hear before.
142,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Amplifiers,"Standard hearing amplifiersThese are simple to useThere is a volume dial and on/off switch on the unitsEach amplifier can be set to your specific volume needsThese aren’t hearings aids so they’re not customizableThey amplify all soundsThey are small and discreet, comfortable in earThey come with a charging case, usb cable and ear tips"
142,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,very easy to use,"This hearing aid provides clear sound, equipped with smart features such as noise reduction and automatic adjustment, enabling better hearing of desired sounds in various environments. Its design is more compact and refined, almost imperceptible, making the wearer feel more natural and comfortable. It improves the quality of life for people with hearing impairments."
142,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works well for my grandma,"To help my grandma cope with mild hearing loss, I purchased this hearing aid for her, which comes with a portable charging case that is especially suited to her needs. The smart and simple operation design of this hearing aid is very grandma friendly, and even elderly people who are not too familiar with new technology can easily grasp how to use it.Since using this hearing aid, Grandma's quality of life has improved. She can now hear family conversations and ambient sounds more clearly, allowing her to better participate in family activities. The portability of the charging case also ensures that the hearing aid can maintain enough power when going out."
142,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Lightweight,"The hearing aid is good quality. Firstly, it is very compact and comfortable to wear, with an additional five sizes of silicone earplugs available for use. Secondly, it comes with a digital display battery case, which is very user-friendly. Not only can it be charged at any time, but it also shows the remaining battery capacity in the case. It effectively amplifies sound while reducing background noise, and it doesn't have the noticeable feedback issues that other hearing aids often have. It can be used independently or together, allowing for adjustable volume control. The inclusion of a cleaning tool is also considerate. Overall, it's a well-designed and user-friendly device."
142,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth buying.,"From the moment Mom started using hearing aids, she was quickly able to hear conversations at normal volumes, as if a veil had been lifted and she was once again part of the world around her. One of the most striking features of this hearing aid is its seamless integration into everyday life. It's incredibly user-friendly and the controls are simple, and my mom picked it up quickly. The device is also discreet and comfortable, allowing her to wear it all day without irritation or discomfort. This was an important factor in her acceptance and continued use of the device. Thanks!"

29,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Audien Atom is a credible hearing aide especially for the price,"Purchased the Audien Atom (entry level model) for a very reasonable price.  Well packaged with clear instructions - I was up and running within 10 minutes of getting the batteries charged.  Really with the videos it is easy to set up.  The device seems to be well designed the different sized ear buds allow you to fit it to your ear.  The two devices look very small but I ended up using the smallest ear buds -- this surprised me because I am not a small person.  They do amplify the sound well -- in fact as well as a $1600 set of hearing aides I purchased from COSTCO two years ago.  Those were more sophisticated and allow fine tuning of the sound and also had Blue Tooth which is so great for hearing aides -- but they were the over-the-ear type and that does not fit my life style with wearing glasses and doing exercises in the gym..  I think the sound with the Atom is quite clear and clean for such an inexpensive unit.  There is only one hearing program but it seems well designed because I have used in both indoors (large rooms & small rooms, at my computer, in my car, and even talking on the cell phone -- so far it is working quite well -- especially considering the price.  It works well outdoors too -- I am hearing high pitched birds like Cedar Waxwings and wood warblers with this device in my ear. Does give a lot of feed back if you put your hand to your ear but this has not caused and issues for me.  If I continue to like this base model I may upgrade to Audien's more advanced models with more sophisticated programs.On May 30th , two weeks after purchase I decided that the Atom would not work for me because my right ear canal is too narrow.  The Atom was constantly working its way our of the canal and I was afraid it would fall out sometime and I'd lose it.  I contacted the Audien customer support and they offered to exchange my Atom hearing aides for a pair of their top-of-the-line Atom 2 Pro hearing aides and they also waived the up-charge so I am getting a set of more sophisticated and expensive model hearing aides for no additional money!  I say, hard to beat customer service like that?  No company can please everyone all the time but for me Audien has been GREAT."
29,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,This is an effective hearing amplifier for those with mild to moderate high frequency hearing loss,"Thi Audience Atom is small, discreet, and helpful for people who suffer mild to moderate hearing loss especially if your loss is in the high frequency range.  I am 78, played in rock bands for many years, and noticed loss in my ability to clearly hear conversations (especially in noisy environments like restaurants) and when watching tv.  I just wasn’t “getting it all”. I tried the Audiences Atom Pro 2 at first and it was effective and comfortable bit I found the programming buttons to be annoying.  Every time I inserted one of the devices I’m my ear I would hit the button accidentally and have to go through all of the menu options again.  I returned the Pro 2 and ordered the Atom.  Much simpler but still effective.  Both versions reduce low frequencies and boost high frequencies….  exactly what I need since my hearing response drops off pretty rapidly above 2,000 cycles.  I am a retired electrical engineer and am very familiar with with hearing response in humans.  It is very common as we age to lose high frequency response.  The Atom is comfortable, discreet (most people will never know your wearing them), and effective.  Once you find the right amount of amplification that you need there is no need to adjust it again.  Battery life is excellent.  The charging base is very easy to use.  Overall the Audien is an excellent, affordable choice for me.  The existing models don’t work well with a phone…..placing the phone close to your ear causes feedback (squealing).  I wish Audien would develop a Bluetooth in-the-ear version controlled by a phone app so that I could truly customize the frequency response and gain to my specific needs.  When they develop it I will buy it.  ARE YOU LISTENING AUDIEN???  Overall I have found the Audien products excellent.  Pick the right one for you and hear everything again!"
29,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Update on Previous Review - Low Price Hearing Aids That Work Well, But The Batteries Are Bad.","I have had these hearing aids for about 9 months now, and now I'm not the fan that I was after the first 1 or 2 months.  Battery life is questionable, or worse.  After 9 months the batteries are just not doing the job.  One side works about 2 hours, and the other side is down to less than one hour of operation before it's necessary to recharge them.Notwithstanding that, I'll explain some of the other features, some of which would be great features if the batteries lasted longer.  I usually watch my TV with the volume set at 20.  When I put the Atom Hearing Aids in, I can turn the volume down to 10.  This is huge.  When I go to meetings where there is a speaker who isn't well amplified, and I have trouble hearing them, I simply slide in the Atom Hearing Aids, and I hear the speaker easily.  I've found that I can insert the device in my ear and then turn it on, and there is no feedback wailing whatsoever.  The feedback comes if I turn the device on before putting it in my ear.  The Hearing Aids have little switches on them that are easy to flip to the ""on"" position with my fingernail.They're comfortable.  I have large ears, and large ear canals, and I put the small wax guards on the Atom Hearing Aids, and then fit into my ear canal completely, with a lot of comfort.Noise cancellation is not very good.  I hear background noise as loudly as I do the speaker I'm listening to, but I'm just so glad that I can hear the speaker that I'll put up with the background noise.Remember - Battery life is questionable.The Volume Control is great.  I set it where I like it with the tiny screw driver that ships with the Hearing Aids, and I put the screw driver away for future use.  I run my Atom Hearing Aids at about 45% volume.The Sound Quality is better than I expected.  Sounds are a bit on the treble side, but I'm happy with that because I usually have trouble hearing treble frequencies.I still like these hearing aids, however, for an overall rating, I give them a C because of the miserable battery life.  Otherwise, they would be a B.  I have other hearing aids that are not as good as these.  Even the $4500 hearing aids that I bought at a Hearing Specialist's Office are not as good as these Atom Hearing Aids, but the $4500 hearing aids have replaceable batteries, and these Atom hearing aids have rechargeable batteries that are shot after just 9 months."
29,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,It is remarkable...,"What is amazing about these hearing aids is how it works. It works extremely well. I never had hearing aids that would stay in my ear, not fall off my ear, and be comfortable all day.These are extreme quality, sophisticated digital hearing. Now I can hear myself type at the keyboard and people can no longer sneak up on me, can hear a cricket a mile away feels like. I can hear the freezer, refrigerator, and heater running all at the same time! OK, it works. I worried that the nylon wire might break but don't worry, if it did, you can still reach your hearing aid and take it out and don't worry about the dome getting stuck in your ear. It is on quite hard, cannot easily pull it off, for those worried about getting it stuck in your ear.Now, let's get to the reason why you want this. If you are like me and I had sonar hearing in the Navy one time, you are being plague with sounds and Wi-Fi causing problems everywhere you go. That is another subject. This Audien Hearing Aids helps with letting you hear people talk in a noisy environment and talking to a few people. I like that! Oh yeah, I might also say that music is AGAIN awesome.I have tinnitus and other hearing problems in my left ear. Maybe from putting a cue tip in my air one time, who knows? Hearing is delicate, so be careful with cue tips, as the explosion in your ear from touching it too hard feels like lightning struck. Anyway, my left ear has been diagnosed to have tinnitus. This Audien device allows my left ear to hear even better than my right ear.Now I will be honest here, there is no miracle cure for tinnitus or why it comes and goes, louder and less sometimes. I will tell you that wearing these you will almost forget about the tinnitus because all noises will be coming back to you and the background noise almost canceled out. As we age, this becomes more important.As my Neurologist would say, the brain has to adapt, and it will adapt. I see by the reviews that people either love these hearing aids or they don't. What I have to say about that is it takes a bit of getting used to. One is that there is something in your ear. The 2nd is setting the settings right. Do only a few ticks to the right of the volume when you set it first time. Don't go all the way up, you will blow your ear out.I do 3 ticks from the left going clockwise. I keep it there for my left ear. I love it. I worry about the cleaning going forward, but I think you can wear it for a while before it needs a good cleaning. They give replacement domes and clear instructions. I am not delicate with anything, so be sure that these are amazingly strong, but treat them with care. That is hard for me, but I figured it out.The final thing is I am not sure if this has noise-cancelling or not, but I will tell you it clarifies sounds and any ear problems with internal sounds coming from tinnitus or ear problems will be lessened to a great extent. Now, I am not a Doctor or Neurologist like I go to, but I will say that my Neurologist and primary care doctor, not to mention my Cardiologist all recommend it, as to be able to hear is less stressing.The key is to get used to the canal. It only goes in so far and the tip (dome) will not fall off. Lastly, the support is awesome. I got one that had a defect. It happens. Giovanni gave me excellent support and stayed at his work past 6:00PM and helped me for almost an hour. He could have gone home. I am on the East Coast and forgot about the time difference. He replaced the defect. I have never in my life seen support this good! I no longer need $2,000 to $8,000 hearing aids for my left ear. The USA government has now made it legal for OTC hearing products, and I wish they would do that with other stuff. The fact is these are comparable to expensive ones and the technology is awesome and superior to analog, in my opinion, of course. I wrote a more lengthy review as I am highly impressed with these hearing aids. I have had other digital hearing aids that were a disaster. These work and the support is there if you need it."
29,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Atom didn't work for me.,"The Atom did not work for me. First I have to say that I suffer from Tinnitus caused by gunfire resulting in hearing loss and loud ringing in my ears.I cannot hear dialog on TV or personal conversation very well at all, especially if there is background noise. I miss 80 percent of what is said.High pitched sound, a whistle, beeping alarms, etc. often cause me pain, sometimes severe.My experience with the Atom is that it amplifies higher tones associated with treble and high end midtones like voices, ice jingling in a glass, microwave alarm, the ticking of a large clock, etc. Amplification seemed to filter out lower tones, bass and lower treble and using the Atom only made the problem worse.I could not hear dialog of actors or people on TV, especially if there is background music, which is always perceived as much louder than dialog. In effect cancelling anything people are saying in spite of the high end amplification the Atom provides.I tried on various ear domes and started using the Atom at its lowest setting as recommended. On the lowest setting I could not detect any amplification, it was as if they were Off. I gradually increased the setting as recommended. The higher the setting the more painful the treble tones hurt me.The instructions recommend patience as you wear them for a couple of hours and then eventually all day so you can acclimate to the device. I have to say I could not acclimatize myself at all to the high end amplification even on the lowest setting. The slightest high end sounds in the background made it impossible for me to hear voices as everything blended together to create exquisite unenjoyable noise.This is the first hearing aide I have ever tried so I cannot compare them to anything else.I can only say they did not work for me because chances are that my Tinnitus caused a handicap in its ability to improve hearing. Not the fault of the device.They may well work for you, as long as you're hearing loss does not include ringing in your ears.They fit my ears perfectly and we're comfortable to wear. I'm so disappointed they didn't work because my hearing loss and ringing is so bad that I cannot enjoy watching a movie for conversation with family or friends and I was hoping to be able to join conversations or a movie again.I can only state the Atom was ineffective for me. Maybe they'll work for you. And I hope they do.I appreciate being able to return them. I am thankful for that at least."
29,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,Almost functional,I bought these for my mother and they did improve her hearing but I had two problems with them.  If you get them loud enough to be helpful the feedback when anything gets near them is a problem.  Also we never could get a fit that was good enough to keep them in.  If you stay perfectly still they are ok but even the motion of eating works them out of the ears.  I’m going to look for something else for her.
29,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Help,"Have bought 2 pair for my dad. They work great if you can get charged. Both sets one charged and one didn’t. My dad liked them, he could hear and they were comfortable, but this last pair has only lasted a 1.5 months. Can’t find a number to call . They are registered."
29,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent starter/entry level Hearing Aid,"I researched OTC hearing aids quite a bit and the Audien Atom kept popping up with very positive feedback.  Just turning 60, and have been struggling with bad tinnitus and dramatic hearing loss in my left ear, moderate on the right for awhile.  I’ve struggled to hear conversations in crowded or noisy rooms and when I realized I have been reading lips as much as actually hearing the conversations I was involved in I decided it was time to get some help.  Ordered on Amazon 3 weeks ago and had my package delivered in just 2 days.  Very well packaged and complete with everything required to charge, tune, clean and transport the hearing aids. The instructions were very clear and straightforward…. Setup and charging were a piece of cake.  I strongly recommend following the directions for the suggested low end volume setting to start with, wearing the earpieces for just a few hours each day for the first few weeks or so.  There is a definite “ adjustment “ period for fit and it does take a little bit of patience to allow your ears to physically adjust to the presence of the earpiece.  I started with the smallest ear cups and they were perfect, still using them, and have no slippage issue's at all… I’m actually already very confident that they will stay in place through my daily activities.  For me, it was an instant improvement in my hearing, but also in the clarity of my comprehension of television shows and music, as well as conversations with the wife between separate rooms in the house.  My hearing was just about to the point of “ if I can’t see your face while you’re talking I can’t hear you clearly…” and now I can hear my wife talking to me from the next room with ease.  So far, battery life is pretty good…. I’ve been wearing them at home for 3-4 hours a day to ease into them and they still had more than half their charge left, so will het me through a work day without a problem. I’ve worn them for a few weeks and now my brain is trained to balance my hearing and to ignore the presence of the units… but it DID take a few days, a few hours at a time, to get to that point…. So be patient, and take some time getting used to them and finding a comfortable “position” in your ears…you’ll get there and it will be so worth it!  For me, this was absolutely the perfect way to test the waters in addressing my inevitable hearing loss … certainly there are much more advanced ( and expensive!) hearing aid options out there, and they may address a wider area of impairment levels etc. - but, for the cost of these well made , easy to use units you can’t beat the benefit and improvement to age related and minor hearing loss.  Kudos to Audien Atom…. Such a positive improvement in my everyday quality of life and a very welcome change in my ability to rejoin conversations and things like music and television.  Looking forward to using these daily….. I highly recommend the ATOM to anyone looking into an entry level OTC hearing aid. They are  a fantastic product that’s effective , affordable and easy to use!!"
29,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,NOT A HEARING AID!,"Please don't be fooled. These are an actual hearing aid while they improve the ability to hear the sound around you quite well and do fit amazingly good. They do not differentiate. Sounds if you are like me where you have a difficult time hearing voices but everything else is fine. It will amplify the voice as well as amplify everything else in a pinch. They work pretty decent, but they are absolutely not a replacement for physician designed hearing aids"
29,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works great!,"Hubby bought for himself, because he couldn’t hear g daughter.It’s has made my life sooo much better.  He really didn’t think he was that bad.  But now I don’t have to repeat myself all the time,  the TV isn’t up as high. Hallelujah!  My anxiety is less.  He’s now gonna purchase the blue tooth ones next.He wears them like for 12 hours and forgets to recharge, so he’s gonna get the others  to alternate. Even a difference in his talking sooo loud.  WIN WIN.  They were on sale is why he tried them. Now waiting for them to go back on sale again to purchase again.  Hugs to all the women who pu with deaf hard headed men.  Lol. 🧑🏻‍🦳👨🏼‍🦳"
29,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great product for the price.,Great product for the price. I'm going to use them for watching TV. I have a headset that I wear currently but it restricts me hearing people talking in the room. This will able me to hear the tv and others talking in the room
29,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,They do the job!,"The most important note is that I didn’t have to send them back. They work and are pretty comfortable using the smallest adapter. I used the little tool to turn them down and that helped with the whooshing sound you get if the volume is too high. I recommend trying these if your hearing loss is not too bad and you just need a boost. I carry them with me and stick one in if I need it. I rarely wear both at the same time and I find it works for me. The feature I really appreciate is the on/off button! It keeps them from squealing before I get them in-so embarrassing. Try them, they work!"
29,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Nice,So far so good. I've only recently started using hearing amplifiers and the first pair was very uncomfortable. These are very comfortable and easy to put in/out. I'm still getting used to the amplification as the noise around me is a lot louder than those talking to me who are close by. Watching TV is so much better as I can keep the volume down and when driving in the car I can hear the kids talking in the back seat. So far I like it but the noise cancelling could be way better or I just need to get adjusted to it yet as it's only been about a week that I've been using them following your guide on usage. Again so far so good.
29,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,SO FAR SO GOOD !!!,Got these and so far work great and the volume i left on what they were sent on and i can hear pretty good went out side and i could hear my wind chime with the wind blowing sound away from me at 50 yards real good very pleased with that and the ear buds with other aids i have used the larger ones but with these i am trying the middle size and seem to be working i dont hear no kick back and i think it does not really matter what kind you get the wind WILL AFFECT HOW YOU HEAR outside i will be really putting them to the test here soon as turkey season is coming and see if i can hear old tom out in the woods but well worth the money also my Brother has some $2000 plus hearing aids and i can hear things better with these than i could with his so ya i am happy
29,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Hearing,They do not last very long I mean they will not recharge after about 6 months.
29,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Volume Has Big Range,"This is my first (and so far only) pair of hearings aids. They are comfortable to wear, even though I have very small ears, and (for me, at least) I found the volume range to be quite big. The first time I wore them I didn't realize how high the volume was so I jokingly told a friend that I could hear color. Once I realized it was the volume being turned up so loud, I turned it down easily and I could still hear extremely well, just not quite as loudly. It was great!"
29,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,It’s as good as the pricey hearing aid,The hearing aid works find except the battery gets discharge after couple of hours
29,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,A waste,Just amplifiers.  Comfortable fit but they amplify every noise except what you want to hear.  One of mine started to cut out so am returning them.  I won’t  be reordering  as they r not worth the money.
29,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,This product is well worth the money.,The Atom is very easy to use right out of the box.  I was able to turn down my TV immediately.  Talking on the phone is very easy now.The volume must be turned all the way down to charge the unit.  I didn't find this in the instructions.
29,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Manageable volume/squeaking control,Works well with one voice input. It is horrible when many voices input.
29,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great,"Bought for my mom who is 76 & starting to have hearing issues. Easy to use, works very well. She said you just have to remember to remove before you shower."
29,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Works As Advertised.,Nuff said.
29,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Effective for the price,"As it has become more difficult to hear conversations at restaurants and other loud places, I was ready to look into getting a hearing aid.  I happened to see an instagram post on the Audien Atom and decided to take a chance.  The device is very comfortable to wear and provides significant improvement in my hearing.  This is an excellent value for the price."
29,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Not bad...,"I've had many aids over the years and bought these as a backup for my expensive ones. I must say these are really pretty good, especially for $99! Bought a second pair for my wife but they are too big for her tiny ears."
29,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,I cried!,"I recommend this product to anyone who has problems hearing and can't afford hearing aids. I put mine in at the park and for the first time in many years I was able to hear the birds singing. It was so overwhelming that I could not stop the tears from flowing. I gave this product a 4 star only because for me it amplifies the wind to much but I may just need to get adjusted to them.  IF YOU CAN'T HEAR WELL BUY THIS PRODUCT NOW, YOU WON'T REGRET IT!!!"
29,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,How easy to use,Works well for a normal conversation
29,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great! for the price.,"""Normal"" hearing aids could cost you $2,000 to $5,000. These, at a fraction of the price, worked almost as well. If I only could make them fit in my ears ..."
29,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,So Far So Good,"This hearing aids seem to be working for me.  Still learning about them, but happy at this time."
29,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,DO NOT BUY -stopped recharging after only 3 weeks,"When first charged up, these worked great- volume was easily adjusted, background noise was lessened and stayed in the ear comfortably. However, after only 3 weeks, these would not charge any longer and were unusable.Customer service was no help in trying to resolve the problem or help with a return.Bottom line, NOT WORTH the $100."
29,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Easy to lose,They don’t give you a travel/protective container. Just a tiny pull/string bag. Lost mine assuming pulling my keys out of my pocket.
29,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Fine, if you can keep them in","I spend more time trying to find them wherever they rolled.  Chewing food, talking, turning your head....It takes nothing to dislodge them even if you've tried several different size ear pieces. The old over the ear aides are getting another chance."
29,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,They work....,"Little more background noise than I was expecting, however sound during conversations is acceptable.  Will keep them."
29,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good little hearing aid. Insecure Fit,Hearing aid works good. The bad part is the rubber fitting piece that goes in the ear is not very secure and I have put the largest oneon the unit. Have to keep pushing it in to avoid the unit falling out.
29,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound and comfortable, but two sets so far with issues.","I really like these, however the first set had one that stopped charging after the second week. I returned those for another set and as of right now just over two weeks one of them started making static and then stopped working. I could turn it off and on and it worked for a couple minutes and then did the same thing again. I feel I can’t recommend them now due to this."
29,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Ease of use,The hearing aid is very easy for my 85 year old father to use. He does have difficulty turning it on and off as the switch is so small. He enjoys hearing though. It’s been 15 years since I could speak instead of yell at him and he hears me. It’s a WIN WIN. We are both happy with his new hearing aids.
29,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Larger than expected.,"The quality of the sound is excellent I bought these for my wife especially for TV sound and they are a great option, except she can not keep them in her ears due to the large size. She does have very small ear canals, but I am an average size male and they are really almost too large for me as well."
29,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Feedback issues,"These are working on the lowest volume setting only for a 95 year old male who's very hard of hearing. Using as backups only. When we try to increase the volume past the lowest setting, the feedback squeal is awful according to the wearer."
29,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,They do improve my husbands hearing,My husband likes them and he’s hard to please.
29,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works great I can hear better all ready,I absolutely love these hearing aids the minute I put them on I could hear better  now it’s going take time getting use to hearing better so far they are amazing and I love them
29,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great pair of hearing aid,"Great hearing aids for beginner, these where for lady in my neighborhood who is has hearing loss but the resources for hearing aid where triple the price. She loves them."
29,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Use and comfort,It is priced reasonably and it is simple to operate.Functionality is limited but it is ok for short periods as spare.Manufacturers should add limited frequency adjustments.
29,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Works well,"I don't like the occasional whistles, but that's easily corrected with an adjustment in my ear."
29,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good price for hearing aids,We got these for my mother in-law. This is her first time ever using hearing aids. She doesn't wear them all the time sense she isn't used to using them. The ear piece comes with several different sizes to fit into ear properly. She does ok wearing them in quieter places without allot of of inference however when in public places she struggles with it being to loud in her ear even after adjusting the volume levels. They are easy to put in and take out. It came with charging cord and case. They do need to be fully charged after receiving them. Haven't worn them long enough to know how long the batteries work. We think they are good for the price and she will need time to see how they will work for her.
29,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Noise,They do a lot of squawking.
29,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Most important,I like everything about the product. Great price.
29,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Work great for a very reasonable price.,"I purchased mainly to watch TV without blasting the volume. They work great for this purpose. I have not yet worn them daily, as I am still getting used to the feel. They do pick up electrical interference when too close to my led reading lamp."
29,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,,"Mis aparatos auditivos de inicio son los que tuve que comprar de nuevo, este modelo es perfecto solo que no tiene el bloqueador de sonidos fuertes o inesperados. Si lo tuviera sería más que perfecto. A comparación de los demás diseños porque compré 3 diferentes de la misma Marca y chillan no puedes calibrar un sonido aceptable para que puedas oír y no hagan ruido molesto, no funcionó para mi pagar más por mejores equipos"
29,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Pleased in Laurel MS,I have lost over 40% of my hearing but can’t afford expensive hearing aides so my caregiver suggested I try these and I really like them …. They fit well in my ears and I haven’t had any problems whatsoever … easy to clean and charge I’m confident that I will be buying some for my husband soon ! I was amazed at the price ( unbeatable ) so thank you for creating such a good affordable product
29,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Does the job,It is an excellent product for the price. It's not a high-end hearing aid but does a great jobfor folks who are not financially situated to buy the best. These will do until. They do work well enough to hear better.
29,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Hearing aides,Did not help hearing.
29,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Non Noise Cancelling is exactly what I needed,"Non Noise Cancelling is exactly what I needed. I occasionally suffer with inner ear issues when getting any kind of cold making my hearing almost non existent. It often lasts for weeks. These are perfect for the times I need them. Great fit, charge lasts all day and the sound quality is very good.I previously tried ""Noise Cancelling hearing Aids"" which did not work out for me at all. Those type eliminate all background sound and if any loud sound close to me would startle me.These merely raise the volume at all frequencies without any sound processing.The only negative I experienced is you cannot bring the volume past half way without them making a feedback whistle."
29,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good for the price,"I've only lost some limited amount of hearing, which I only notice when the closed captions on tv say ""crowd murmuring"" ""music playing"" or other background noises that they post in words, but I cannot hear on the movie.  I have the volume down on these pretty low.  I turned them up higher, only to get some feedback.  But, low is really all I need to capture the little bit that I am not hearing naturally.These are a good starter set.  Hoping I don't need the real deal, from going completely deaf, anytime soon."
29,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Constant background noise,"I was disappointed with the constant noise made by the hearing aids. I turned them to the lowest settings but could still hear the noise. Also, I didn't like the fact that you had to take them out of your ear and use a tool to adjust the volume. I will say they amplified the volume and they were not uncomfortable but I returned them and will try another type."
29,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Audien ATOM Rechargeable Hearing Amplifier to Aid and Assist Hearing,This was our first experience with a Hearing Amplifier.  I gave it a 5 Star Rating because to us it does do what it claims in its Advertisement in Amazon.  Its set up and operation is pretty straight forward.  About the only thing I didn't find clearly explained in the Instructions has to do with the Charging of the Ear pieces.  Instructions said to insert the USB-C cable into the Charging unit and a Blue LED would light up when connected.  What it did Not clearly state was that when the Ear pieces were properly inserted into the two Charging cavities  that a Red LED would begin Flashing On and Off for each Charging cavity.  When Fully Charged - the Flashing Red LED would change to a Flashing Green LED to indicated that the Ear pieces were Fully Charged and Ready for use.  I learned this when I sent a Question to the Products Listing on Amazon.  The answer to my question was immediately available.  Overall - I think that this is a pretty Good entry level product.
29,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent Customer Service,"After speaking with Anastasia about the issues we were having with the Audience Atom OTC Hearing Aids we purchased for my mother, we determined that the devices were too large for her ears. Anastasia was most helpful and understanding and professional. She resolved the issue and we look forward to my mother’s improved hearing."
29,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,comfortable,"I got these as a Christmas present, and to be honest, just started using them today. So far, they are very comfortable and the instructions are very easy to follow. I would rate them five stars if I had more experience with them. I plan to update this review after I have used them for a few weeks."
29,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,They worked great the first time!!,"First time I wore these, they worked perfect."
29,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Hearing much better now!,My husband is hearing a lot better now.  It took a little while for him to get used to things being so much louder and clearer.  Now he hears me correctly and less discussion towards me (wife) and him hearing me incorrectly.  Halleluiah!!!
29,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Best hearing amplifier that I have tried.,I have had problems with other hearing amplifiers. The last set of another brand ($250) which I tried lasted three weeks until the volume went to zero.These sound better than any of the others. Hopefully they will last.
29,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Updated review,"Got this for my mother and she loved it but then they stopped working after three weeks, I did everything they told to do for trouble shooting but still nothing, very disappointing and of course now it’s after the return period so I’m stuck with them I guess. I thought we’ll great price but I guess the old saying is true, you do get what you pay for so buyers beware!!!Updated review!!! I initially gave one star and a bad review cause hearing aides stopped working a few weeks after receiving them, thought we’ll it is past the deadline to return them and get a refund, in my surprise I received e-mail from company and was asked if I would like a full refund and I or course said yes, they emailed me a return label and I have sent them back and received my refund, I’m a happy customer. Give them a try, I may have had a faulty set and that was just my luck but that could be one out of hundred, if you have problems email the company and I’m sure you too will get your money back if your not happy with the product."
29,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Work great, but too big for small ears.","The hearing devises work well. I am really impressed with the sound quality. The problem is that I have small ears, and small ear canals. The devices will not fit in my ears. They hurt if I try to shove them in. If I don't shove them in they fall out. Yes, I put the smallest cuff(or whatever that thing is called) on them. If you have larger ears they will be great. They really do work well. I am going to try to keep them because I don't think I can get any that are small enough for my ears anyway."
29,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good value,"I purchased these because I don't have a lot of money, I like them specifically for listening to TV. Problem now is that the TV volume has to be turned up for my wife which is extra loud with these aids. When she goes to bed I turn down the volume of the TV and listen without disturbing her. To be honest I think the sound is a little tinny. I'm still experimenting with the volume, they suggest a usage for your ears to get used to them which I'm following."
29,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Decent Amplifier, But Not What I Need","After having and using these in-ear audio amplifiers for around 12 months, I've come to the conclusion that they are decent, durable quality, but not really what I need for my hearing issues.Basically, the Audien in-ear amplifiers are that--amplifiers. These inexpensive units amplify sound, but do not have circuits to reduce background noise. As a result, the volume of sound reaching my ear is greater, but so is the background noise. Understanding conversation in noisy situations (restaurants or group gatherings and poor TV audio was my issue. Initially, I thought these units were the answer, but with continued use I realized that everything was louder, not just the voices.There is another  Audien unit (Atom Pro) that claim to have noise reduction technology. I may give these a try. I don't fault the quality or durability of the the Audien Atom amplifiers, they just don't address my issue very well. Quality is good, durability is good, sound amplification is good. The missing ingredient is background noise reduction. That is really what I need for my condition.If your condition just needs sound amplification, the these are the units for you. If background noise is a problem, then maybe not."
29,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Being able to hear again,My hearing has been getting worse lately and I can’t enjoy a conversation with my friends because everything is jumbled together if more than one person speaks. Also my tv is set to the highest frequency. You feel left out of ever. Now I can hear what people are saying and my tv is turned down by 1/2 . Very pleased with these.  Thanks for making something that was decent and affordable.
29,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Amplifies, barely noticeable, amazing","I have never used hearing aids and have frustrated many people asking them to repeat what they have said. Audien hearing amplifies the sounds in your ears with adjustable volume. Be careful and start low and build up the volume as needed. I started slow with one ear and then the other. You can not adjust background sound, tone or pitch. Audien hearing is allowing me to interact in more conversation and to speak quieter. For the price they are amazing."
29,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,They were unfortunately too big for my earsI,"I loved the sound improvement but they were too big for my years, most of it sat in the outer part of the ear and fell out easilyThe volume control is easy but has to be done manually with a tiny instrument that was missing in the first packet I ordered and I can see how it can be easily misplaced or lost.Would love these if they were half the sizeVolume could be adjusted via Bluetooth on one’s phone"
29,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good purchase,Got these hearing aids for my elderly parents. They work well and the sound is clear and helpful.
29,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,"They really work, But Quality Control Is Shakey","The first order had one aid that worked 1 week. The second set had a charge dock that only charged one side. I offered to pay for the third aid and not return it as I do not know how long they are going to hold up but they can not understand I really want to pay for the extra aid I am keeping. They just sent a third dock not understanding. By the way it only charges on one side like #2. Hey, $99 risk and at this point I think I am going to end up with an extra aid. They really have been generous even if they can not understand the problem."
29,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Hearing aid,It's not as effective as I had hoped. Good money value though
29,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Hearing much better,I'm able to turn the tv volume down and have been hearing people much better
29,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,update,"I am really hopeful this will work out well for me.  I have been using the neck arm type from Neosonic for quite some time and while that works very well, the wires and neck arm thing has a habit of becoming tangled in my hair and clothing.  I have also tried the type with the effort which goes behind the ear, but they are not really good with my ears, not to mention they are in the way of my glasses.So far it has been half a day and I am doing fine with these things.  The sound is a bit tinny, but definitely an improvement.  The real test will be when my son, the mumble king, returns home this evening.  If it improves my ability to hear him, we will have a winner.The volume control thing is quite difficult to use, but eventually I did succeed in increasing it a bit. They are very comfortable and so far have not fallen out of my ear after several hours.  I am not sure if I can comment on the noise cancellation as I tend to hear all sorts of extraneous sounds anyway.Update:. In the end after 3 days I am returning them.  The sound is just too tinny and when I am on the phone it is really hard to make out what folks are saying.  I am also hearing a beep from the CO detector I didn't even know we had. It is super annoying. It seemed to only augment the higher pitch sounds, so I was still finding it hard to hear the male mumbling. I will go back to the neck band one for now."
29,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fantastic customer service!!!,We purchased these for my husband.  They charged up well and he wore them liked them.  They were a bit bulky but ok.  Then for the second charge the charger no longer worked!  So we contacted the company and they promptly got back with us and were very helpful!  In our conversation we told them we would rather return these and purchase the upgraded pair as they were smaller.  Not only did they upgrade at no additional cost to us clear up to the most expensive device they sell!!  Needless to say we were gratefully shocked.  But they also sent another message air of the original.My husband is now getting accustomed to the new ones.  There is an art to putting them in that he hasn’t quite conquered.  So if you are looking for something really simple these take some adjusting.  But I imagine most hearing devices would.We are just so grateful for their amazing customer service!!
29,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Beyond belief!!!,"The media could not be loaded.
                



Tears of joy this morning!!! As many of you know I am hearing impaired. When we discovered it, I had already lost the upper and lower ranges of my hearing. Once the doctor put in the hearing aids for the first time, the first amplified sound I heard was Deanna Marie Young  voice saying I love you Mom! Then the doctor turned on water  and I instantly got a migraine from hearing all the different sounds water can make. I thought that was the best thing in the world! However all the hearing aids I have had have been uncomfortable and limited in what I could hear. If you play the video I've attached there's a sound that my refrigerator makes when you leave the door open. Until today I had never heard it! I actually heard it with my back turned to the refrigerator! I rarely endorse a product but this one is truly amazing not only are the hearing aids very comfortable, I don't even know they're in! But they work beautifully! This is only my third day wearing them and according to the inserted instructions, it's going to continue to improve! Praise God! The surprising thing is not only were these hearing aids covered by my HSA with my BCBS insurance, but they were only $100!"
29,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Works pretty good,"I have tinnitus in one ear.  This hearing aid when warn in that ear has improved my hearing.  I can watch tv at a lower volume which I’m sure my family appreciates.  Also, was at a social gathering and was able to hear all conversations.  I like that i can use either hearing aid in that ear.  I do like the in ear application. I got them at a good on sale price ($20) cheaper than usual.  However, I do have a few issues. Due to the antenna that protrudes, you can not wear a hat or headbands with it.  Where I live, it gets cold in the fall/winter and you need head gear.  Also, I have found that out in the wind, I cannot wear them.  The hearing aids magnify the wind sound causing the need to remove them."
29,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Audian hearing aids,The ear peice keeps falling out of my lady's ears and seems hard to insert so far.Perhaps a few more reducers to get the right fit are in order?
29,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Hey, for $100 it's Great!","My wife and I both have problems. My Mother's two hearing aids were way over $1500. These help a lot. Not perfect, but hey! For $100? Just Great! I use one and my wife uses the other.  I have trouble with fluid in my left ear. With the Atom I can hear Stereo again. Sometimes it gets overwhelmed and crackles a little, but over all I'm kind of amazed. It tends to fall out of my ear though when I'm chewing or talking too much. I had to get used to checking it once in a while or it's going to fall out into the grate in the street or a toilet or something, but I couldn't use the larger ear cones. I need to use the smallest. Most of the time I use it I forget it's there. Bravo and any improvements they make will hopefully make them even better."
29,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"NOT TO HAVE TO KEEP ASKING  ""CAN YOU REPEAT WHAT YOU SAID""",THESE HEARING AIDS ARE SO COMFORTABLE THAT YOU FORGET YOU ARE WEARING THEM. THEY ARE SO  EASY TO PUT IN MY EARS PLUS THEY DON'T FALL OUT LIKE SOME OF THE OTHER HEARING AIDS DO.  BEST OF ALL AUDIEN HEARING STANDS BEHIND THEIR HEARING AIDS.
29,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Easy to use and great hearing clarity,"I love how this product works. It’s well worth the money! I do have a problem which I will be contacting the company about. One of the hearing aids works great, but the other one doesn’t work at all. If I can get this problem corrected, I would definitely give a 5 star rating!"
29,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,No More Repeating,I an so happy ang grateful  for AUDIEM ATOM hearing  aids.  I can easily hear and understand  what people are saying to me now. What a relief. Thank you
29,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good value for the money,My husband is pleased with these hearing aids.  He says they work well for him.  He prefers buying less expensive ones and replacing them as often as needed.
29,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very happy.,Bought these to replace a cheap $25 amplifier I was using that died on me. These are comfortable and I can hear very clearly. I hope these last but so far they are very worth the money!
29,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Audience hearing aids,"I got these for camping, exercise and as a backup to my $5000 hearing aids. They are wonderful as I can hear almost as good as the $5000 pair. And I got the least expensive. I have moderate/severe hearing loss. One of the best item’s I’ve ordered from Amazon! Thank you so much!"
29,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,You Get What You Pay For,"These are [hearing amplifiers] and not [hearing aids].  What do I mean by that?  They are simply microphones and amplifiers in your ear that amplify all sounds, including unwanted sounds.  An example of this is when I tried them at work, the sound of typing on my keyboard was amplified so much, that it drowned out the other ambient noise.  In other words, they are not selective and there is no noise cancellation or suppression for sudden loud noises.  Also, if you don't have a snug ear fit with the buds, you will get extreme feedback screech.  I'm not saying don't buy these, but understand what you're getting and what you're not getting.  Not returning but wouldn't purchase again."
29,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,EDIT ** 100 STARS. Everything about the Audien Atom is perfect!!,"EdIT: Not sure if this helps anyone,, but these aids sit in your ear, not ""into"" the cannel,,They sit in the ""Cup"" part of your ear and ""touch"" the cannel opening. I hope this helps someone...Omgosh!!! Where to begin...I'm an 80 year old young lady!!Profoundly hard of hearing.. think TV volume over 50 with CC on..I now have it set in the 30's!!But I want to add.. years ago I stopped ""listening"" to people talking. Now i need to pay attention.... I couldn't hear them unless they yelled... I heard my elevator for the first time!!! Omgosh... I had no idea it made any noise...The aid sits in the ""cup"" of my ear, I'm not kidding when I say I don't know it's there!!!This is truly a life changer for me!!! I've only had it a short time and I'm following ALL the instructions about length of time wearing it and volume adjustments...I've seen many hearing specialists,,,, they were NO help at all...This Audien Atom aid arrived the same day I ordered it!! Can you even believe that?!?!The packaging was very, very nice, it almost made it feel like a gift!! A ""BOW"" design wouldn't be out of line.I sincerely hope you give this a try for your own benefit.It's a new life for this old lady.I received nothing for this review!! And it's not my firstattempt at aids.  But it's my last.  Great product!!Thank you Audien Atom"
29,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very affordable,"My hearing had got so bad that everything sounded like a bursted speaker. A friend of mine had a set of the Audien Atom hearing aids and preferred them over his expensive set and suggested I try a set of the Atoms. I immediately ordered a set. Received them on time charged them up. Found the proper ear piece that fit my ear and put hem end and got them adjusted. So far everything is great. I can hear the tv clearly, talk to my family and place orders at the drive thru restaurants again. They are very affordable and work great. I have already recommended them to some of my friends. They are very simple to setup and use and let’s you hear again clearly."
29,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good product for the price,These are a good value for the price. They work very well! The only negative thing about them for me is that they screeech in my ear canal until I get them positioned correctly then it stops. Very satisfied overall
29,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Easy to use hearing aids,"Rechargeable,  easy to use, long battery life. Too big for my ear canal. I wish they were smaller around because they keep trying to pop out of my ear."
29,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,you get what you pay for..,"I am 59, I know I need hearing aids... I ordered these for basically throw aways to see how it improves etc, before I get a comfortable correct pair from sams or costco etc...They were uncomfortable at first, went to small ear piece and that helps, you need to kind of JAM them in, I had one fall into garbage disposal ( not running ) but it did get wet, still working ( 5 for that)Volume setting is near the lowest for me and it is fine.. too loud it will feedback very loud.You need to get use to little quiet sounds like your fridge or printers sitting idle or computer fans running...watching TV has improved a lot especially shows with English actors...In  my car I now hear the AC fan over the radio so I think this is an issue with needing a pro to set up a correct pitch etc for me..They get a 4 for not being comfortable but that could be me!!$99 is a good start.."
29,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,LOVE THEM,I use them all day every day. I CAN HEAR!I can understand and hear what people are saying to me! I LOVE THEM!!! And they're so much cheaper than a regular hearing aids.
29,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Works well for amplifying sounds,"Listening to the world andy husband who bought them for me, Monday cup different sizes so chewing or talking they could fall out of your ear"
29,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Website Tutorials Unhelpful,"I opened the package and began charging the amplifiers. So I'm looking through the instructions and they send you to their website where they have tutorial videos. The tutorials would be very helpful if they were for this model. They tell you that when you remove them from the case they are automatically on. So I put them in my ear and nothing. I go ahead and rerun the video. Yes, that's what it says along with information on the light system on the front and the back and the button on the case that changes modes and I believe volume. Well, I don't have any lights on the front and I don't have any button at all. So finally after much time spent searching their website and their information I go to an individual who is just one of those folks that likes to make videos about products. Lo and behold, I noticed something. Right off, in the tutorials the case has a flip up, flip down cover, and mine does not. And this fellow tells you that when you remove them from the case you must turn them on. You bet, there's an on-off switch. You guessed it, turning them on made quite a bit of difference! Out of the box mine were set to what I'll call the middle volume level, which was way too loud for me. It's late and I'm not going to get out the tiny screwdriver to turn the volume to the lower level. I think for a hundred bucks they're going to be okay. If they fail, as at least one other reviewer mentioned, that would be a different matter. Right now, but for the poor instructions, I would have given them five stars, taking the dirt cheap price into consideration."
29,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,This is Worth every dollar. Good!,"I received my Audien OTC hearing aid in good time.  The packaging was up to standard. I was satisfied with what I saw in the package itself, what you needed to adjust the volume and all the items that they say were in it, was there. I ran a test as soon as I got it and on first impression it provided what I needed in terms of hearing enhancement so two thumbs up to that. Only thing that I had an issue with was the instructions on charging it could have had a two-liner that says when you put the hearing aids in the charger you will see a red light or two green flashing lights and when the green flashing lights are steady then it is fully charged. I did not take any chances I put in the hearing aids and just let it stay for 4 hours to see if they were any changes to the light slashing or or the indicators of charging. The instructions for it is to make sure you charge it before you use it, which I did. Otherwise I am satisfied two thumbs up."
29,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,They work!!,"These hearing aids help me to hear and recognize higher frequency pitches in voice recognition patterns.  Since I am a musician, it also helps me to locate correct pitches in rehearsal instead of ""overtones"" emitted by upper woodwinds playing in the higher register.  My other aids were never correctly synchronized, so the left earpiece was always a quarter to an eighth higher than the right one.  For $4,000.00 this was unacceptable, for sure.  These Atom units also cut my chronic tinnitus significantly, which a DEFINITE blessing.  One other thing:  I appreciate the independent volume adjustments.  My other units are synchronized and do not provide an easy way to adjust.  Sometimes, one doesn't need to drive a Lamborghini when a Much Less expensive car will get you there just as well.  Thanks for developing a product that--so far--has proven to be better than my other units."
29,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Audien I can hear,Dislike one has stopped working. Trying different things first
29,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Love the Audien!,"I have experienced some hearing loss in one ear so I ordered the Audien to help me with that. It has been a wonderful experience so far. I have had them for about 3 weeks now. It fit in my ear just perfectly, straight out of the box and required very little getting used to. My only complaint....and the reason for 4 stars instead of 5....is that it doesn't filter background noise well at all. I can't stand to wear it in a noisy restaurant, as it is way too loud and overwhelming. Other than that, I love it and would highly recommend it to a friend."
29,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Basic Amplification,"With no experience with professionally designed or fitted hearing aids, I have nothing to compare these to. It seems to me they are basic amplification and little else, though that's really what I was shopping for. Others have said they didn't think the units were noise-cancelling and I tend to agree. But I was out on my front porch with both earpieces in, and I could have sworn there was heavy machinery operating right in front of my house, barely 75 feet away. Turns out it was on a nearby hillside, nearly 750 feet away.I bought these mostly because I was tired of figuring out new ways to get my wife to repeat what she just said, without admitting I couldn't catch her words exactly. On that score, these little buds have made a nice improvement. Worth what they cost. If I need to make a step up, I'll probably swallow my pride and go see an audiologist."
29,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,problems with the first set,I had problems at first. Jack at customer service was great. Updated me to the Atom Pro 2. So far I would give them a 5. Better controls and sound quality.
29,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Only an amplifier. Good alternative for hearing aids.,"These are just amplifier s, work good, if you push them to far in ears, wax guard acts like a ear plug.So inside ear placement is key.  I have worn opticon hearing aids. This is a good alternative. Use caution on volume Adjustment. They come midway and I turned them lower. s hearing your own breathing is to loud."
29,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Hard to keep in ears,These hearing aids are hard to use because the charger doesn't always charge them when docked. I have fought with 2 different sets and experienced the same problem with each. Also the shape of the aids don't fit my ears well so I'm constantly looking for a dropped aid. Wouldn't buy them again.
29,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Audien Atom Hearing Aid,"These are great considering the price.  Tend to make ear canal itch.  My only real complaint is there is no discrimination intelligence to filter background noises.  You hear literally everything.  Never realized how noisy refrigerators, and central heat/air are.  If you find that annoying, take a silence break.  Also a word of insertion advice.  Put them in your ear with the nylon pull tab at the lower end of your ear or towards your ear lobe. Also if you are getting feedback, tinniness or concert hall echo, it’s not in your ear canal correctly.  Great value for the price but on the excessive noise issue, you get what you pay for.  This is a P.S.  Forgot to mention another nice feature.  Most of the OTC hearing aids have a right and left.  The Audien Atom is generic enough to use in either ear.  Need to bear that in mind if you need different volumes between your ears.  Fortunately, you can see the volume control setting at a glance."

16,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not a great fit,I have tried many different times to get these to fit in my ear well but they just don't sit well. Tried all the tips to no avail.
16,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,Doesn’t Work Well,"I got this for my dad which already has an over the ear Siemens hearing aid and wanted something more concealed, but this one doesn’t work well. Volume setting is very hard, because you don’t actually know what setting is every time you press the button. They should have added a light indicator or voice telling what volume is whenever you press the button. Feed back cancellation advertised feature does not work, and starts whistling around volume 8-9. Actually, since it starts whistling, we kept pushing the button until it stopped, so we knew it was volume 1 there. Volume 3-4 is okay for him, but he says he hears his own voice in his head, and the voice are much clearer with Siemens. I’m not sure if it’s worth the price. Thanks for reading, and YMMV."
16,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Very good hearing aids for seniors,"I have been having trouble hearing for several years. My daughter finally convinced me to order hearing aids. These are exactly what I needed. I did not want anything sticking out of my ears for people to see. These hearing aids are very tiny, and you recharge them instead of using batteries. They are easy to handle and use. I am very impresses with the sound quality and how easy it has been to use them and recharge them at night."
16,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,All-around fail,"I have been wearing hearing aids for over 5 years, and I've been very happy with my current BTE aids, which are OTC aids also. I know all the ins and outs, and what to expect from them. I know I'm not allowed to mention the brand here.Right from the start, these were problematic. The LEDs on the charger showed power in, but no power level lights for the aids. Not even after more than TWELVE HOURS ON THE CHARGER. I finally put them in, turns out the issue was with the lights, because the aids were fully powered.The hearing aids themselves left so much to be desired. I tried various volume levels, different tips, removed and reinserted them. I wore them for half the day, knowing I had to adjust to them. I double-checked for wax buildup.The sound quality is muddy, concentrating more on the middle frequencies when most people need the boost in the upper range; my own voice echoed, and drowned out everything else. Unlike other hearing aids, there is no app to adjust them. The ambient sound, which I always heard well with other aids, was non-existent, like I was wearing earplugs- I'd be afraid to cross the street wearing these!Bottom line: If you have a mild to moderate hearing loss get hearing aids, they'll change your life... Just don't buy these."
16,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,They sound horrible and are prone to feedback.,I tried these and lasted about two days.  They not only sound horrible it’s impossible to adjust them without subjecting yourself to feedback.  The only way to turn the volume down is to turn them up all the way which eventually gets you to the lowest volume setting.  The digital microphone sounds extremely digital and not in a good way.  They don’t process music well at all.  I felt like a cyborg having these things in my ears.  Out of curiosity I tried setting my AirPod Pros on transparency (which turns them into a hearing aid).  They sounded 100 percent better and they cost less than these.  Don’t waste your time on these.  If I could give them negative stars I would.
16,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome!!,"The quality of this product blows me away. I almost did not order these because I was afraid that, being an OTC product, they would be more like an amplifier than an actual hearing aid. They are not perfect and up to the standards of those you would buy from an audiologist, but for someone who can't afford 3-5 thousand dollars, they work well; I bought these for my son, who can't afford the high-dollar ones, and they work well for him and helps him hear better. It is a good product for the money."
16,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Okay hearing aids,"Even though I am still blessed with mostly good aural functionality, I have reached the point where an occasionally ""boost"" in volume can definitely help in certain situations and circumstances.As such, I ordered these hearing aids for occasional use only, with somewhat mixed results. The hearing aids are comfortable and last nearly all day, and while I found that TV audio was definitely easier to hear and clearer, radio/streaming audio did not fare quite as well.All in all, for an inexpensive set of hearing aids, these performed mostly acceptably, albeit not spectacularly."
16,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,NOTHING MORE THN AN AMPLIFIER,Sure you can watch tv with a lower volume. But in a group. The background noise is awful I can’t even hear the person in front of me.And interestingly I bought neo on mdhearing website.can’t leave a review….

16,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Useless,Item arrived without the “ends”
16,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good for close conversation, can't turn down volume","At first I loved these hearing aids - when I was using them at home. I really thought these were gonna be ""the ones"". (I've been trying a lot to see which ones work for me.)  Despite the fact that they go IN the ear and not on the outside, they were comfortable. I must have narrow ear canals or something because usually, the ones that go in the ear, actually HURT me. These didn't. Well, when I put in the one in my left ear, sometimes it makes me gag - not sure what that's about, but it does.They were easy to charge and unlike most hearing aids, it actually came with a block to plug into the wall! And I liked that these are pretty discreet.As I used them more often, I found that the sound quality wasn't real great - sometimes sounded like I didn't tune in the radio well if that makes any sense. Also, what really bothered me was in places where I needed to listen at a long distance, it just wasn't picking it up. It makes everything loud but the further things are away, the harder it is to pick it up. Like at church or in an auditorium or listening to a speaker - it wasn't helping. And if I tried turning it up, it would squeal. And there's no turning it down. You have to just turn it off or keep turning it up and hope it gets to the lowest volume setting.I DID like that you can turn it on when it's in your ear and you can hear the beeps to know if it's turning on or off, or volume up.I really had high hopes for these. Back to the drawing board.... Though I MIGHT be able to use them at home at least."
16,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Slight crackling noise that gradually gets louder,"This review is for the following item:  MDHearingAid NEO Hearing Aids for Seniors, Rechargeable In-The-Ear Design, All-Day Comfort, Virtually Invisible, Crystal-Clear Sound by MDHearing, Fits with Glasses …I did have some difficulty at first with this hearing aids. I am not sure how many volume levels there actually are, but 5 of them cause a very high pitch whistle.  After that is eliminated by repeatedly pressing the volume button, it then appears that there are maybe 3 levels of volume that do not cause the whistle.  At first I was very happy with the second non-whistling volume.But after 30 minutes or so, I could hear a crackling noise, very slight, hardly noticeable at all.  At first I thought it was something in the room that I was picking up.  But that was not the case.  It was the hearing aids.  The crackling got louder over the course of the next hour or so and became very annoying.I did try increasing the volume to see if that would eliminate the crackle, but no, that just brought on the high pitched whistle.  I then started over with the low volume, but now because I was aware of the crackle, I could pick it up on the lowest volume.I took the hearing aids out and put them back in, thinking maybe they weren't placed correctly.  But nothing I did would stop that crackle.I do have a cheaper pair of hearing aids that work much better than these.  Of course they have issues also, so I thought that if I purchased a higher priced set, I would be happier with them.  That is definitely not the case.These hearing aids definitely do not work well for me at all."
16,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Hearing aids/too large to stay in ears,I ordered these hearing aids for my 86 year old mother who thought the window for return was 45 days since that is what she had seen on TV.  They are too large to stay in her ears.  Is there anything we can do now?

You have to remove it entirely if you want to talk on the phone.I  made up my mind to return these within a half hour of playing around with trying to adjust them.And, I'm going with the battery type. I'd much rather replace a battery every few days than having to charge them for hours every night.Not impressed!"
16,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,Stay with the BTE model,I have this very hearing aid as a BTE model and pleased with it . Have had them for almost a year . My only complaint about the BTE is that it amplifies sounds from the rear . Not the sound I wish to hear . (front) My suggestion is buy the BTE model !! The aid is well worth the money . Pleased customer . (BTE model that is)
16,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Feedback, feedback and feedback",I couldn't get the feedback to stop unless I turned the volume so low that there was no benefit.  Amazon took them back without question within 30 days which is plenty of time to tell if they will work for you.

16,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Very disappointed,"I bought these last April for my husband for our anniversary. He has progressively gotten hard of hearing. One of them stopped working within about a month of using them.  Less than 9 months later, they won't even turn on anymore. These are pricey for something that doesn't even work for a year and no manufacturer warranty."
16,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Do NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!,Do NOT BUY THESE THROUGH AMAZON!This manufacturer will not stand by their warranty and repair or replace a broken hearing aid. I have only used them for 47 days and one has stopped working completely. Amazon's Asurion Warranty tells me that I must contact the manufacturer and manufacturer tells me they will not honor the warranty because it was purchased through 3rd party (Amazon)  Neither will fix hearing aid nor refund my money!DO NOT WASTE YOUR $ !!!
16,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Bad review,I can't believe you denied request for refund because it was s day & a half past the 30 days. I did everything I could to make the hearing aids work including waiting for an ent appt to flush ears. To find I have a narrow ear canal that why they wouldn't fully go in my ear. Thanks. Bad review
16,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Giving problem within 4 months of use,After 4 months of use it started creating noise and no longer useable.
16,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great,"Works great,just what I needed."
16,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Amplifiers, not hearing aids",Sound quality is not that great. I hear more background noise than I do conversations. I would never purchase them again.
16,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,NO MANUAL.  UPDATED,"$300 and the manufacturer is too cheap to put in a manual.  instead there is a manual online which is great except many people WHO ARE OLD ENOUGH TO NEED HEARING AIDS ARE NOT ONLINE. Say, my 95 year old father.  To top it off, the web address is in such tiny print my 91 year old mother had to find a magnifying glass to read it to me over the phone so I could print out the manual for them.  Do they work?  Who knows?  I'll be helping them try and set them up tomorrow.  $300 and no manual.UPDATE:  Sara at the company was wonderful - there IS suppose to be a manual in the box (just not ours), and she was very helpful with tips to help with usage.  Dad says they work for him!"
16,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Sound amplifiers, not hearing aids","I agree with the other review.  These are just sound amplifiers that work over the range of 200hz to 5000 Hz.  A lot of people's hearing loss from aging is in the higher frequency range.  But these hearing aids amplify the same amount over the whole range.  For instance, say your hearing has become diminished above 2000 Hz and you need 20dB of amplification.  These hearing aids are quite capable of providing that. You will get that from 2000 Hz to 5000 Hz and it will help you to hear in that range, but you will also get that from 2000 Hz down to 200 Hz where you don't need it.  That means you are going to get 10 times as much sound in that range.  The instructions even say ""some sounds may seem too load” Well that is because they are! The instructions are misleading and say ""Your brain is relearning how to prioritize sounds” Well that sounds nice but it is a fallacy.  No one needs to hear 10 time as much sound in the frequency range as they normally can hear well and that might even be detrimental. What is really ridiculous is that with microelectronics it does not cost anything to make an amplifier that only works over a narrow frequency range.  But to get that you have to pay 10 to 30 times or more the cost of these amplifiers because they are called “custom” - they customize the sound amplification frequency range, instead of the same amplification across the whole range, as these do."
16,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,Product unsatisfactory,The charger didn’t work properly and the small cables to remove hearing aid were not matched. One was shorter than the other.
16,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are real hearing aids. I've had them for five months now and am thrilled with them.,"These are real hearing aids. They are NOT sound amplifiers as some people say. I tried sound amplifiers in the past and know the difference. These hearing aids are wonderful and really work. I like how easy they are to adjust. I really like the little charging case. It's small, and I can carry it in my purse in case I decide to take them out. The charge lasts a long time. I have been telling my neighbors and even recommended them to my doctor, plus my friend who works at a store that sells the pricey hearing aids. She often sees people who have to walk away from getting hearing aids because they can't afford the outrageous prices."
16,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Three times the price for unusable trash,"They come with 9 volume levels. Thats cool, but anything above level 2 is pure feedback all the time.They come with background noise reduction. Sweet, now if more than one person in a room is talking the aids either max out and clip into pure static, or they mute everything so they become ear plugs not amplifiers.Save your money and buy a $60 pair of cheapies, that will still work better than these. Or pony-up and buy a legitimate pair. These things are trash."
16,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Not for mom,This might be good for most. It was hard for my mom to operate.

89,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,loud,"these look nice and fit well but, they simply do not work well. they pick up wayyyy too much noise and  no matter how you adjust them, all you hear is  background kinda noises, from paper rustling to even the cat water fountain making dripping noise in the back room.. there is no cancelling out this noise and noise in same room including voices are even worse, you can’t hear someone talking to you well because background noises are being picked up at the same time. Maybe ones we got aren’t working well, i don’t know but, they are unusable and hub rather be hard of hearing then use them.."
89,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,I Hear You - Loud & Clear!,"3/3/23 Update: I use these daily and really love them. I actually hear the Television better with them than my 4 year old prescribed pair. During the past weeks, I did find the fit better using the smaller domes than the ones shipped with (mid-sized). If the dome doesn't go in the ear canal far enough, it works its way back out. I like the case has a built in battery capable of recharging the hearing aids a couple times, before needing recharged itself. I would definitely recommend the Go Prime Digital hearing aids to anyone with mild hearing loss - especially those reluctant to get tested and then spend a lot of money. I'm sure you know that friend or loved one that is always saying, Huh?Original: As an Amazon Vine member, I've had the opportunity to try several OTC hearing aids/devices over the past year. These Go Prime Digital Hearing Aids are currently the best OTC hearing aids I have tried; Seriously! I originally planned using these for a full week before writing this review, however after 3 days using them, I felt the need to review them. The hearing aids are magnetically nested in their case. The case serves as a means to charge the hearing aids. It also serves to charge the hearing aids up to 6 times using the case alone (using the internal battery) before the case must be connected via USB C to a power source (both included). The hearing aids automatically turn on when removed from the case (you'll hear the start-up tones in your ear). The hearing aids shut off when they're inserted back into the case. So you must have the case near whenever you remove them or they'll remain on. This isn't really a negative, once you're aware and used to this feature. It is the first hearing aids I've used set up this way.  The hearing aids have 8 different volume levels. The level is adjusted by pressing the button once; you'll hear a tone. The volume goes up one level for each press. When you reach the top level and press again, you'll hear 2 beeps. The next press takes you back to level 1. When you first insert the hearing aid, be sure to count the levels going up. This will let you know what level you feel works best if you return to level 1. I did each side separately, while listening to a TV set to our normal listening level. I have moderate hearing loss in my left ear and more in my right ear. These really amplify the sound. I expected to have to turn the right ear up all the way. I found the left ear set to 4 and the right to 6 works perfect for my hearing loss. Once you have them set where you like, they will turn back on at that volume level and frequency setting.  Once set, the TV even sounds clearer and louder than my audiologist fitted hearing aids. I really like these Go Prime hearing aids.  The other feature of these, they have 3 settings. In setting 1 (1 Beep) all sounds are amplified. On setting 2 (2 Beeps) high frequency sounds are amplified more. On setting 3 (3 Beeps) low frequency sounds are amplified more. I tried out all 3 settings and decided setting 1 works best for me. There's a noticeable difference listening to a program with the settings.  To conclude, these are great OTC hearing devices. With them, I can hear the TV (and my wife) clearly. I don't struggle as much with conversations. When my wife sets the volume now, it is a bit loud for my new ears. These are a bit pricier than others I've tried but much cheaper than going to an audiologist. I would definitely recommend these to anyone suffering from mild to moderate hearing loss.

89,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Wow - Picks up Rustling Paper!,"Honestly was worried about getting a set of hearing aids over the internet.  After I charged them.  I took them out and each one was beeping.  I pressed the tiny bottom button and they turned one.  You'll do this to each one.  It was amazing how much it picked up.  I could hear loudly someone dropping something in another room and even me turning the instruction book pages in my hands.  There does seem to be a tiny bit of an echo noise.  To adjust the volume press the tiny bottom button.  It says it has 8 levels and when you reach max volume you will hear 2 beeps.  I suggest tuning these in a pretty quiet room since these are so sensitive.  I tried the different frequency settings and I didn't notice any differences but definitely play around with getting a sound that's right for you.  The frequency settings are changed by holding down the tiny bottom button until they beep 2, 3 and back to 1.  Give these are try they definitely increase what you'll be able to hear."
89,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Picks Up Sounds Quite Well,The first thing that is noticed with these hearing aid is that they amplify sound good.  They are ear buds that come with their charging case that shows when they are fully ready to use.  The charging life is quite good and they will stay easily charged for the day.  They fit the ear nice without high visiblity.  One of the first things that is noticeable is that tapping on desks or when speaking the sounds are quite loud.  Close sounds and speaking are amplified and need to be adjusted for.  Each ear should be adjusted and tested individually. This takes some adjusting and over time may need to be changed.  These are nice for the hearing impared.  They do help with my right side tinnitus making it not quite as noticeable.  These hearing aids are worth getting for all time wearing or as needed.  Well worth looking into.
89,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is truly a hearing aid vs just an amplifier,"After trying two devices that simply amplified sound, this one became available.  Each hearing aid has eight volume settings and three preset programs.  The charging case is a charger in itself so that one never needs to worry about changing batteries or losing power.  For most of my adult life I have had high frequency hearing loss and this set comes very close to meeting all of my needs.  I tried them on a friend who has hearing loss across all frequencies and he is amazed at the quality of sound, especially because his loss is greater in one ear than the other so he can adjust volume accordingly.  Controls are very simple. auto-on whenever they are removed from the case, one button for both volume and toggling between the preset programs. I also like that the case has magnetic slots for safe and easy storage when not wearing them.  Due to my high frequency deficit, I wear external blue tooth devices that are controlled by an app on my phone and also serve as ear buds for music and telephone conversations. However, in most instances, these in-ear hearing aids are good at addressing most of my hearing needs.  A big difference for me is that when I need to adjust them for different settings, they each must be adjusted manually which is a little obvious to others versus my blue tooth external aids that can be adjusted more discretely via my phone.  Lastly, the feedback reduction on these aids works really good, much better in fact than my external hearing aids."
89,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Noise Isolation is great!,"I ordered both these (prime) and the go-lite hearing aids. These work and sound great and are comfortable to wear. The main difference between these and the go-lite is that these are a noise-canceling feature. Let me tell you, they sound way better and really isolate the noise and get rid of the background noise. These are $100 which may be a little more than what I have liked. I think these at the $250 price range would be a better deal. Regardless they work great and my grandma is very happy with them."
89,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good amplifier!,"These take a little getting used to but overall are a good amplifier. I like how discrete these are when I wear them. They have 3 different modes, each with 8 levels. It took me some time playing with the settings to figure out which mode worked best for my environment. I originally thought I would use normal mode for everything but sometimes it’s just not the best mode. I recommend reading the instructions and being patient as your ears adjust to these. Overall they are very comfortable and work well!"
89,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Satisfies the basic need.,"The product is well packaged. Exquisite workmanship. Read the manual carefully and debug. The product has three different usage modes. There are different levels, choose according to your needs. The product is in good use, but there is noise when switching between different modes and levels."
89,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Way to much Background noise- Magnified.,"Way to much background noise. Everything echo's from my own voice to the surrounding sounds.  When someone is talking to me, it sounds like they're in a tin can. I hear everything that I don't want to hear. Disappointed. Want to return!"
89,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Quality!,"They are full ear buds. I like that they are 2 different colors - red for right ear and blue for left ear. The case is slim and powerful enough to charge 5-6 times before being plugged in. It arrives with everything you need and good instructions for use. They came with a charge so that you can use them immediately. My dad could hear better and had a big smile. TV now doesn't have to be turned up so loud!! Now, you do have the feed back with them inserted. You hear yourself talking but not uncomfortably - just something you have to get use to. They do whistle as you touch them and as you get them settled in ear properly. Once settled, they do not whistle anymore. One of the better sets we have tried since I cannot get my dad to be tested and get legit hearing aids. Definitely a good route to help with hearing loss."
89,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Great hearing aids BUT,"They work just fine but I spend more time looking for them then my mom does wearing them, they constantly fall out even when I put them in for her (she's 96 and just and watches tv all day they shouldn't be falling out).  I would think if you have normal to larger ear canals I they would make a fine purchase but for a woman with smaller ear canals stay away."
89,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great amplifiers & very easy to use!,"I ordered these for my husband, so we could watch TV together without it blasting or with closed captions on. I am amazed how easy they are to use & how well they work. They fit him comfortably, but I do notice they don’t go into his ear as far as in the listing. I am not sure he is at the point where he’d wear them outside of our home yet, but he says they make a big difference.  They are small, but they don’t go in his ear as far, so they are a little less discreet than I thought. We discussed changing the ear domes, but he said they fit. They turn on automatically when you take them out of the case & off when you put them back in to charge. There is a small button right on the aids to adjust volume. It comes with charging cable & plug. It also provides 3 different sizes of ear domes. Wax guards & cleaning brush too.  These would be great for older people, as they are so simple to use.  The sound amplification is great. We did some tests when he first put them in & was impressed with what he could hear. He said they work really well. Great product, we definitely recommend."
89,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,What you say,"These are very sophisticated hearing aids and are really comfortable, but you should read your instruction manual before you even use them. It will give you vital information, like changing the tips to fit your ear to make them comfortable for you. The quality is excellent and the value for the price is a no-brainer. One thing for sure, be careful, just sticking them in your ear right out the box they can be a little loud that's why it's important to turn them down to a low volume setting before you begin. but after all those adjustments are out the way, the What you say, is a thing of the past. Another important thing is they arrived quickly."
89,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Surprisingly effective - even for the ""I can hear FINE"" among us...","Go Prime Digital Hearing Aids for Seniors and Adults, In-the-Ear Rechargeable Hearing Aids with Noise Reduction and Discreet Fit for All-Day Comfort, Includes Rechargeable Hearing Aid Case (Black)My husband ordered these for himself - which surprised and delighted me in equal measure, since he usually spends all his time insisting that he can hear JUST FINE THANK YOU, while asking me to repeat everything I say... He reports that they are amazing. The directions threw him off for a bit as far as volume control (there are 2 models listed in one book of instructions, and it took him a minute to figure out he was reading the wrong ones) but once he got that straightened out, he was amazed at how much they picked up. He didn't have to blast the sound from his computer, but was able to hear at low volumes quite clearly and well. When he took them to work he could even hear the conversation in the next room! You can adjust them to find your perfect sound range (he prefers the 3rd setting which increases the bass and allows for clearer vocal distinuishing over higher pitches)."
89,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,A bit pricey but really nice quality,"My hearing has not been great since i was in my early 20's and had a double ear infection which caused me to have issues hearing well when there is too much background noise. Being in my late 40''s i figured it was time to give these a try and see if they would help me in those situations. I am quite pleased with how well they really do work. I've never worn a hearing aid before and was a bit apprehensive about using them. These really do amplify the sounds around you so that you can hear better and don't have to say ""what"" all the time. They hold a charge for a while, are easy to charge and easy to wear. They fit in my ears nicely and stayed without any issues."
89,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Comfortable,"Oh, I got these hearing devices for my husband who I feel is slightly hard of hearing although he’ll disagree. They charge easily. Charged with a USB cable but the product does come with a brick. They are very comfortable. There are three settings. They definitely worked to amplify sound. However, it also amplifies, your own speaking. We are not familiar with how high end hearing aids work, so not sure if this is a thing. The devices are marked right and left and you really can’t feel them in your ears."
89,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,broke in 2 months too late for refund,my dad is 82 at first very excited but never fit right right one was bigger than the left onehe tried all the cushions to get that right one to fit which led it to breakI would not recommend this product unless the manufacturer replaces at no cost as there is a 1 year warranty so I will change this review if this happensI am shipping them back today 8.23.23
89,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent purchase,"These hearing aids are small and comfortable and have an excellent voice amplifier. I bought these for my grandpa, and he loves them. He was looking for something discreet, but at the same time, that was functional for him. Another great feature of this product is that the battery life is excellent."
89,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent, Sounds",They actually work as well as the one I received from the doctor
89,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Impressed!,I’m quite impressed with these. They look awesome and feel very comfortable. They come in a very nice and sleek charging case. Sounds great and works perfectly. Very high quality and very well made. HIGHLY recommended!
89,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,What A Difference!,"I purchased the Go Prime hearing aids as a replacement for my 94 yr-old Dad's ""In-The Ear"" brand, not knowing what to expect and we were so pleased, my Dad is smiling again!! There are 3-channels (Normal-High-Low frequency and (8) volumes. My Dad settled on the Low with #4 volume. Very nice quality. Definitely need someone with a steady hand to make the adjustments and you can only cycle up but there is a 'beep' when you hit the highest volume, so you can keep track of the setting. We started out with the 'Miracle Ear' $3,000 ones but after they broke, we began trying these online ones. Supposedly can hold a 30hr charge but I just put them in every night but the charger seems to know what to do. The charger has magnets so no need to fumble with each holder, they drop right in. Definitely worth the money so far......."
89,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,not a good choice for seniors,"I work for a charity that works with a lot of senior clients who need hearing aids. We purchased these for a client as a trial of OTC hearing aids based on a review by the National Council on Aging. Here is our client's review.************Out of the box,It came with two color coded OTC hearing aids.One Charging Adapter, One Charging Case and One Charging Cable.Six Domes two each Small, Medium and Large.Four Spare Wax Guards and One Cleaning Brush.User Manual.After Charging,The units looked nice but the part that showed When Installed is black and very noticeable to others. They were able to be seen from a few feet away. I know this may seem vain but we all want to be at our best and not want others to point out our faults especially when we get older.DomesThe units come with three sizes of domes. The medium size comes on the unit so this was the first one I tried. It took a bit to get them adjusted but this was my first time with hearing aids so it might have been my inexperience that made it harder. After wearing them for a day I tried the smaller ones but soon found out that they keep falling out of my ears. They fit similar to air pods but are not as comfortable. It felt as if I had heavy cotton stuffed in my ears. The domes are to be replaced every month and sometimes sooner so along with the wax guards they will be purchased separately. The domes were very hard to put onto the Hearing Aid. It took several tries to get them on.Adjusting the Unit.The units, which have to be adjusted separately, have eight volume levels and three different program levels all controlled by one small black button on each earpiece. Both ear pieces must be adjusted separately. Given the size of a person's finger and the small button it is very hard to adjust the volume and the program levels. While Adjusting the volume level, there is a great deal of electrical noise. (If you are a Star Wars Fan it was like R2 D2 on steroids) During this you must listen for a small beep. Remembering this is for people who are hard of hearing and probably have fingers that are a bit numb, I would have thought they could have done better with the adjustment design. I could not use them while on the phone because of the previously mentioned electrical sounds.Sound Quality,First impression they were loud. Even at the lowest level, anything I did sounded like an amplifier was turned up. Example when I opened a bag of chips it sounded like the bag was right next to my ear. The quality of the sound was unnatural like the tinny, slightly echoing sound of a cheap radio. I did use the three programs to test it but I didn't see it improving that much.Final Comments,Because these units are going mostly to the elderly, I cannot recommend them. They are too hard to work with. After several days I still haven't adjusted them to a working level. The sound was harsh and the adjustment was confusing."
89,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Hearing aids,"They are better than most but they still have a ringing in them, but most do"
89,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,They are not for everyone.,"These were unsatisfactory for my specific needs.  I found that even the lowest volume setting was at times, too much for me.  Snapping and clacking noises were very sharp.  Noise reduction suppresses all sound, including the foreground I want to hear.  Applause on TV, crowd noise, etc. brings the total volume down and then it remains down for about three seconds after the noise is gone.  So I miss some of the foreground speech.  None of the three ear ""domes"" was good fit.  They fell out a few times even with the best fit.  They do amplify the sound and in some cases were good for my hearing profile, and the price is good.  They are just not for me."
89,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,So far good,I think that they’re very comfortable. I sometimes forget I have them on . I also like how easy they are to turn the volume up or down.
89,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,They're OK,"Have the typical hearing aid problems: high-pitched voices are garbled, noise in restaurants blocks voice of person next to me, everything Consumer Reports has documented for other hearing aids.  Not really worth the price, to me."
89,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,If I could have given a zero I would have!!!,"First of all, they work great out of the box.  However, the wax filters are go prime specific, you only get 6 for a ridiculous amount of money, thats if you can find them at all.  I was unable to find the filters, tried contacting the company, got nowhere.  I was so impressed at first, I immediately bought a second set.  Talk about buyers remorse!!!  Just know that you won't be able to find the filters, and you can't reach anyone to order any.  I tried to return them, now they don't even show up as a purchase of mine!!  My order and delivery date was June 30th of this year.  Very very poor, non existant customer service.  Steer clear!"
89,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Be patient, they work!",These are great hearing aids. You just have to be patient and give yourself time to get used to them. At first your voice echoes but with time it will no longer bother you.My wife is so happy that the TV is no longer so loud. She loves that she doesn’t have to repeat herself.There are so many positives that I wish I had bought these years ago.
89,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,They're not a small as the photo shows sh,"Received the order on time.  After close inspection, it appeared that the left ear piece had been used, as it wasn't as clean as the right.  If it hadn't been an almost emergency to get them as fast as possible,as one of my other pair died on me, so I was without, I would have sent them back.  The sound control  system is easy to use, but you need to use caution inserting them in your ears as it's easy to accidentally touch the operation button.  I don't notice any noise cancellation nor do they give you any relief from the ringing in your ears.  Once you chose the correct plastic ear piece, they'll fit pretty good, however, they're larger than the photo shows.I gave them 4 stars overall, having used less expensive sound amplifiers They are a little better"
89,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Good but not Great,"I purchased the Go Prime Digital Hearing Aids as a Christmas Gift for my girlfriend and she was happy and excited for the gift until she tried them on. Her hearing loss is more severe than I thought. She has moderate hearing loss but the Go Prime Digital Hearing Aid did not help. Unfortunately, I had to return this item."
89,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,It didn’t work out,"I purchased this for my 73-year-old mother, but it was difficult for her to fit in her ear and adjust the volume. As it didn't work out, I am returning it."
89,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good so far.,"I only use the one first my left ear.It's working very well. Occasionally a get a little static. I'm going to get some more earpieces for a better fit.Overall, it's improved my left ear hearing. My primary complaint. The earpieces are difficult to remove and replace."
89,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Very difficult to adjust volume,"To adjust volume higher is a simple click of the button, but to adjust to a lower volume you must click all the to the highest volume before it starts over at the lowest miss the one you want and 8 more clicks to try again  Also the extra sizes of domes  was not in the box, a call to the seller got a call amazon response and calling amazon i got a call the seller, so no resolution for missing parts!"
89,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,Returned,Fall out of the ear!
89,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good hearing aid .  However can't order accessories.,"The hearing aids work well once we changed to the smaller Silicon tips. We've gone through 2 wax guards (of the 4 provided)  in a month and were looking for more. We can't find any on Amazon, so we had to go to Go Hearing website and order a couple of accessory kits for $16 to get 8 wax guards. Sure would be like to see them on Amazon for a competitive price."
89,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Don’t buy,They’re advertised as not giving that annoying feedback (high pitched tone). The first pair only did it sometimes. I returned them for a replacement because one of them died. It just stopped working. The replacement pair is why I’ve just accepted this is a junk product. The left ear emits that high pitched tone all the time for absolutely no reason at all. First it was if something came close to my ear like a hug. It’s just off and on all day long. This is garbage don’t waste your money.
89,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,Left Hearing Aid detective after only 45 days,GO HEARING PLEASE RESPOND TO THESE COMPLAINTS. I really liked these heating aids and gave them 5 stars. The left hearing aid stopped working after 45 days. 15 days beyond the Amazon return window. Go Hearing will not replace under warranty because I am temporarily living in the Philippines. I am a U.S. citizen doing volunteer work for hospitals. Go Hearing stated that they only warranty their items to U.S. Citizens residing in the U.S. Go hearing will not send me replacements under warranty because I'm out of the country doing volunteer work at hospitals. I  can't even order new ones because they stopped shipping to the Philippines.
89,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,I hear you!,For most part it preforms well. I have had it fall out but not often.  The sound adjustment is a tiny button so easier to adjust sound.  The charge stays well.👍
89,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,I returned the hearing aids because the programs didn't quite fit my hearing loss.,They seemed to take out the background noise quite well.  I think if they fit you they are a good hearing aid for not much money.
89,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,The right hearing completely not working right,"I thought they were going to be a good pair for me,  they were working fine the first week the right side is not working properly i thought by cleaning it was going to help but it didn't the left one works fine"
89,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Poor support,"Using the hearing aids, the Wax Guards fill quickly with wax and prevent any hearing.The only way to buy and change wax guards in this brand is to buy an Accessories Kit online from Go Haering for $16 plus tax and shipping, which has:4 x Small domes4 x Medium domes4 x Large domes8 x Wax Guards1 x Brush1 x Screwdriver3 x Blister packs of drying capsulesI need the Wax Guards only. No other brands of wax guards fit.You pay $2 for each miniature guard, while other brands of hearing aids' sellers charge 10-20 cent."

89,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Impressed,2nd day.  Seems even better than my 3000$ ones.  Hope it lasts!
89,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,It’s hard to find the place to adjust and the wire sticking out is annoying to me,So far I’m not happy . Like one review I saw I have large cracking noises. I cant hear words on tv but I can hear a hammer banging or a bird singing etc.but not voices . I may not have figured out to use it right but it’s made weird to me . Why the wire sticking out snd it’s hard to feel tiny volume to know if your moving it up or down .i havnt called them yet but even if eventually does work I find that wire and tiny flat buttons annoying . But the best thing is doesn’t have to have an app or WiFi all that internet balogna .that’s what I’m looking for but I will call them before deciding .  That’s why only the 1 star so far …

89,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Not a bad choice,These are not fitted hearing aids but more general sized ones. Not a bad deal considering the cost of many hearing aids on the market. These are a great choice if insurance isn't going to provide/cover hearing aids.

89,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,"These are amplifiers not hearing aids, rechargeable","Aloha everyone 🌺 This is Charlie and I'm reviewing these Go Prime rechargeable Hearing aids. I was very excited to receive these, and charged them up right away, so I could start my using them. I am severely hard of hearing in both ears. I was hoping these Go Prime hearing aids would be a spare set of hearing aids for me. That they would be somewhat comparable to the over the ear ones that I wear daily. I did read the manual and followed the instructions on how to get the best use out of these. I feel that these are not hearing aids at all, but hearing amplifiers, these are made for amplifying all sounds with some background dampening for a better hearing experience. I tried these and could not hear anything at all, that is how severe my hearing loss is in both ears. I have severe tinnitus in my right ear and pretty much deaf on that side. My left ear is my best one, but I guess it takes quite a strong hearing aid, for me to be able to hear what a little I do hear. I cannot rate these very well as I just could not hear or use them at all. I can tell you they charge up well, I'm not sure for how long they will hold the charge though. I did like the different size earbuds, I had to use the largest size, but  I still heard nothing, A big bummer for me. 😞. I think the price point is very high, considering they are not true hearing aids, and are not programmable by any means. If you have a moderate hearing loss these might assist you in hearing television conversations or phone calls over a speakerphone. I'm not sure how these would work in a public setting like a restaurant, work, or any kind of gathering. I'll be still searching for another pair of hearing aids, hopefully they're getting better at making these. Okay, I hope this helps. Thank you. Sincerely, Charlie"
89,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Life changing,"I got these for a close friend who is struggling with her hearing.  She had hearing aids years ago, but they wore out.  Her insurance had stopped covering them, and new prescription hearing aids were out of reach, financially.  But these were way more affordable.  The difficult part, with buying “over the counter”, is that there is no audiologist to help fit them and teach the person how to use them.  And my friend was intimidated to do it alone.  It took a couple weeks for us to find a time to look at them together, but yesterday we got it done.The instructions were very good!  And there is a USA phone number to call for support.  We did not have to call but it is comforting to know it is available.  We sailed right through charging them up, putting them together, and choosing options. This was the biggest challenge.  There is just one button, and you use long presses and short presses, and listen to beeps to hear where you are in the menus.  We hesitated to do this with the devices in her ears, because what if we did something wrong and got an ear splitting noise?  But without the devices in, she couldn’t hear the beeps.  Fortunately I can hear it, so I was able to do it for her.  We selected the normal program and the lowest volume, to start.The look on her face when she put them in her ears, made my day!  It was a joy to watch her rejoin the world.  For a long time, she has seemed kinda dazed and out of it, but suddenly she was alert and alive.  Like she gained ten points of IQ, in an instant.  We tested phone calls and tv watching and both went amazingly well.  And she was able to modulate her voice, she stopped shouting at me.Now that she has gotten started, I think she will be able to adjust them on her own.The simple earplug format is easy to manage.  More visible, but less fiddly than the type with wires and amplifiers behind the ears, and they don’t interfere with glasses and face masks.  And I am super impressed with the charging case.  The hearing aids pop in and engage very positively and securely, you don’t have to wiggle them around or anything.The only thing I can think of to wish for, would be a Bluetooth connection to the phone. They don’t have that.  Maybe it’s not allowed for OTC hearing aids?Edited to add:  I have returned to take away a star.  We have two issues.  One, we can’t find any replacement wax guards.  Two, the hearing aids generate a lot of feedback squealing anytime there is background noise.  They are still life changing at home, but when out and about there are problems.  I am working on getting her some proper, prescription hearing aids, instead."
89,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Was hoping for more,"I had also tried their lite version of these, and they were just not a great set.  Lots of feedback and annoyances.These are a bit more than the standard amplifiers.  For people who need real hearing aids, that can work on specific frequencies, these won't solve anything.  But for people who just want a boost, they can help.I liked the idea that these could at least have different settings for different environments, but in my use I didn't find that those settings made any real difference overall.  They just ended up with slightly different parts of the environment getting a bit affected.For watching TV they worked fine, no need to have it turned up as loud as normal for my hearing loss.  They were comfortable, and unlike their LITE version, I didn't have a real problem with feedback squeals here.They most certainly do NOT sit as far in the ear canal as their photo would like to have you believe though, they WILL stick out considerably, so they are anything BUT discreet."
89,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Good deal,I was thinking on getting these to help with back ground noise then I saw that HSN home shopping tv had them on for the same price on Friday the 13th for the $299.99 price and comes with the assararys including a carrying pouch and you would have until after January 2024 to return for a refund if we are not happy with them . I thought this would be helpful if your on the fence about buying these.
89,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Inconsistent,"I have had my hearing tested by an audiologist. I have mild/moderate hearing in one ear caused by a viral infection. Hearing in my other ear is normal. I used this hearing aid for multiple days and compared them against my personal choice, the Sony CRE-C10, and another hearing aid I tested previously, the LEEL. Like the Go Prime, the LEEL are also rechargeable and come with a charging case.  The Sony take standard hearing  aid batteries.  They're also superior to the LEEL and these Go Prime, but at triple the price, you'd expect that.The real interesting contest is between the 2 budget rechargeables.  The Go Prime has a superior charging case in that it's small and looks like the standard wireless earbud charging case. The LEEL charging case is a little bigger but doesn't have a lid. They come with a separate carrying case that is meant to stay in your pocket or purse. The Go Prime wins in having one sleek case that supposedly can recharge hearing aids 6 times.In terms of ease of use, I find the LEEL to be more fiddly and harder to use from a hardware perspective as you need either the small tool they provide or your fingernail to turn up the volume.  But from a logical perspective, this system is easier to understand as you can look at the hearing aid and see where the  volume is set.  It also has a simple on/off switch, so you also know when it's on or off.  The Go Prime theoretically turns on when you remove it from the case and turns off when you put it back in the case. It has one button you use to change programs (normal, high-frequency, low-frequency) and control volume. This system works, but it's annoying as you have to learn to count clicks and beeps to figure out where things are. It will resume at the setting where you left it, but if you want to change anything, you have to count clicks and beeps again. I tend to dislike buttons that require pushing because if you have it in your ear, you're pushing against the inside of your ear, and that can be uncomfortable.When I was able to get the hearing aids to work properly, I really appreciated the low-frequency setting as it works better with listening to music and some audio programs like podcasts and audiobooks. Neither the LEEL nor Sony offer this exact same feature.  However, I spent most of my time pushing that button to try to get the right volume setting.  The hearing aid would come in and out, beeping at me several times in a style that reminded me of the start of a race in the old video game Pole Position as if it were out of battery (note that the manual does not indicate that the hearing aid should ever beep in the manner I observed).  But this would often happen within minutes of removing the aids from the charger after charging them until the lights went out or even while the charger was still plugged in.  They shouldn't have been out of battery even if the claim for 30 hours is incorrect.  This would usually happen in less than an hour. Sometimes, it would come right back on after these beeps, and sometimes, it didn't.  Other times, I'd be able to use them for hours at a time until the pain of it being in my ear became too much to bear. When it did work, I was relatively happy with the sound I was getting. Often, I found I was only able to get it to work reliably at a volume setting higher than what I needed. The volume was sometimes OK for wearing  headphones, but amplified room noises more than necessary. Sounds from the amplified ear sounded extra loud and high-pitched noises were sometimes uncomfortable compared to how I hear them with my ear with normal hearing. Most hearing aids do amplify high-pitched noises, but this is where something that gives you a hearing test, like the Sony, can be superior.I already hinted about comfort. These are much more comfortable than the LEEL, which cause me pain after a while because the body of the hearing aid is too large for my small ears. But they are still much bigger than the Sony. I'm able to wear the Sony all day and almost forget I have it in my ear.  That isn't the case with the Go Prime.  I can wear them for a couple of hours before I need to remove them.  And because the body is so large, they do transmit body noise when I walk more than the Sony, and I can feel them moving around when I chew. I always wanted to remove them when I was eating, but because noisy restaurants are a good use case for hearing aids, I forced myself to keep them in the document the experience. Most in-canal ear devices will need to be adjusted if your jaw moves around a lot, and these are no exception.I'm not sure if the trouble I had with these is reflective of a larger quality control issue or if I just had a finicky pair, but seeing as these are more expensive than the LEEL and underperform in most aspects except the charging case and potential battery life, I'm not sure I'd recommend them over the LEEL except if you're like me and have small ears as the LEEL are likely to cause discomfort over time. They are much cheaper than brand name OTC hearing aids so it might be worth a try if you just want to get a sense for the experience but I think eventally you'll want to move up to something that offers better controls and performance."
89,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Different settings,"These work pretty well for amplification and the three listening modes definitely change the way you hear the sounds. Unlike many of these over the counter units, this model actually helps my tinnitus to some degree.  There is a constant background hiss using these like it is raining outside that may be masking the tinnitus ringing, and maybe the pressure of the buds in my ear helps too, but the tinnitus is reduced by about half, and the varying discomfort from the tinnitus also seems to be minimized.  Aside from the background noise, these also seem to flatten the depth of sound that you hear.  Everything you hear seems ""close"" and sharp sounds jump to the front.  Higher pitched sounds are also louder than lower pitch, even on the lower pitch setting. In loud settings, the background noise can drown out the foreground (the sound that you are trying to focus on). These units do not have any noise cancellation in the sense of filtering out background noise. They are strictly sound amplifiers. Good for me at home watching TV, but not so good out in public. At the current asking price of three hundred, they are entering the range where the quality should be a bit better. You can find similar quality for less than half, but it can be a real roll of the dice because there are a lot of garbage devices in the one to three hundred price range as well.Pros of this model are the push button settings and volume controls while in-ear (no tiny screwdrivers). Battery life is good and the case will recharge the buds, so if fully charged, you could go 5 days or more with just the case, between full charges. It comes with the needed accessories for cleaning as well. Plus the USB cable and plug in charger."
45,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Elevate Your Listening Experience,"Olive Max sets itself apart with its superior performance at a price point that's more accessible than its competitors.  Two elements that I really liked about this product:1. Elegant Design for Comfort and Style: Crafted with both form and function in mind, Olive Max boasts an elegant design that not only enhances your hearing but also complements your daily wear with a modern touch.2. Bluetooth Connectivity for Lifestyle uses: With Bluetooth connectivity, it doubles as sleek earbuds, allowing you to stream music and take calls directly from your device. It also works well with the dedicated My Olive app, which allows you ultimate customization and convenience."
45,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Comfortable fit,There's a bit of a learning curve but online video tutorials are great and there's a support team to walk you through modes and adjustments.
45,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is a steal at this price!!,"Bought this for my dad and he loves it! Didn’t expect it to get this kind of reaction from him, but he couldn’t stop praising how it improved his hearing. For roughly $200 he said it was totally worth it. Very satisfied with this product."
45,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great quality and reliable,"It took me a second to figure out how to use the product, but once I did I couldn't believe the audio and product quality. 100% recommend."
45,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,Does not work as represented,"These are advertised as Over The Counter (OTC) hearing aids, and they may very well have gotten approval as such.  The promotional materials state or imply that these can be used just like a traditional hearing aid -- i.e. worn all day and from environment to environment, AND that they can serve as earbuds for listening to music or taking phone calls.I noticed these when they were promoted on IndieGoGo, and seriously considered them for workouts.  But I am always afraid that if I back something on that platform that it could fail and then I'll have an expensive orphaned product, so I waited.  I was REALLY excited to see them on Amazon.One of my prescription hearing aids needs to go in for repair, so I'll struggle with one (or none) for a week while I wait.  This seemed like the perfect opportunity to try the Olive Max out -- I did not expect them to be nearly as good as my prescription hearing aids, but if they were ""acceptable"", then using them full time for a week would be a real help.My main reason for purchasing them is that I am a ski and bike patroller.  I don't dare wear my expensive (and vital) prescription hearing aids while I'm biking or skiing.  If I lost one (or both) I'd be out big money, and I can't afford to find out whether they are water-resistant enough to last through me sweating all over them.  So I keep them in their box and in a pocket and when I need to hear better, I take them out.  This concept -- an expensive earbud or cheap hearing aid hits my sweet spot.  I intended to use them in situations where I could drop one and where I'm going to be sweating on them.  At $200 - $300, if I lost one or got it wet and it died, I can afford a new one.I previously tested Apple Airpods Pro 2, as they are supposed to be able to be programmed to your audiogram and then transparency mode will make them work ""like"" a hearing aid.  Others have claimed this works -- my experience was that this is ... ""meh"", AND to make it fully work, I need the latest update and mine are not updating.  SO...  Apple had a great idea, but it won't work well enough to be a real solution.I bought the Olive Max ""hearing aids"", hoping they would be everything Apple promised but didn't deliver.  They are UNUSABLE as hearing aids!  I put them through the paces for almost a week and tried noisy situations, quiet, exercise, etc.  Here's what I found, if you are still interested in using them for a similar purpose:* Watching TV:  OK for this -- they pick up the TV and amplify it well enough.  If there is ONLY the TV, then they're pretty good.  However, if someone walks in and talks to you, you can't understand them.* Restaurant:  TOTAL FAIL!  I tried twice, and both times I had to remove them and just ask the server to speak up.  They amplify all the ambient sound WAY too much - to the point that it made me uncomfortable to wear them.* Car:  Similar to the restaurant, they pick up noises that my hearing aids would filter out and amplify them.  With nothing, I can still turn up the radio and hear, or I can have a conversation with someone that knows to speak up a bit.  With these on, it's like driving down the road with the windows open and a metal toolbox full of ball bearings in the back seat.* Meetings:  I hoped to connect directly to the BT on my laptop and use them in Teams or Zoom.  NOPE!!  They will only connect to Android or iOS devices.  I suppose I could have used Teams on my phone, but that is not practical all the time.  I tried using just the computer speakers and mic -- like the above, they over-amplify the ambient sounds and not enough of the voices.  I quickly took them off and instead used my Jabra headset, which works perfectly for meetings.* Conversations:  I tried many with the same result.  My own voice gets over-amplified.  If you've ever had the experience of using headphones or earbuds for public speaking and you get your own voice fed back to you, it can really mess-up your ability to speak coherently.  That's what these do -- they feed your voice back and you hear yourself louder than the person you're talking to.  So if you don't perfectly take turns speaking, then you don't hear the other person -- just yourself.* FEEDBACK!  I tried ALL the domes -- especially the ones labeled ""for less feedback"".  In certain circumstances, I can only set the amplification to 2 or 3 (out of 10) before they start screaming in my ear.  Other times, I can get them to level 5 or 6.  I did find a dome that produced less feedback, but it was still annoying.  You also cannot have anything behind your head, so laying in bed with them is out.* Outdoors:  OK -- this was my MAIN use case for these.  If you are hearing impaired and ride a mountain bike, then people will come right up on your tail before you hear them.  Then they just scare the crap out of you when they pass.  I was really hoping for a hearing aid I can wear on my bike so that I can pick up ambient sounds and not get startled as easily.  I use a program on my phone to track my rides and at each mile point, it will talk to me and tell me my time, pace, heart rate, etc.  If my heart rate goes to high, it will warn me to slow down.  I was hoping the promise of Olive Max being both a hearing aid and an earbud would let me hear my surroundings and also hear my training app.NOPE!!  Doesn't work.  When I ride, my phone is in my backpack.  My cheap $20 earbuds have a button to pause/play and volume up/down buttons.  OliveMax has volume up/down, but it affects the amplification, not the volume of your phone.  There is no button to play/pause, and calls are confusing.  So my experience was this:  I started off with the amplification at a comfortable level, but couldn't hear my app -- then when I increased the volume, the hearing aids amplified everything so much that my 8mph pace sounded like a hurricane AND the app was still too difficult to hear.  I had to stop, dig my phone out and change the volume using the buttons on my phone.  I tried music and the only way to start or stop is on your phone, so that's not going to work.A call did come in, and clicking the volume up button seemed to answer the call, but guess what?  They could hear me, but they were too quiet to hear and I could only turn up the hearing aid amplification with the buttons and my phone was in my backpack.So -- for my main use case -- a hearing aid for on the bike -- they are a complete failure.In summary - as a hearing aid they do not work.  As an earbud -- just buy Bose QuietComfort or Apple Airpods -- they'll be similar in price and you'll be happier.  For a hybrid device?  Keep looking -- I haven't found a good one yet (including my prescription hearing aids that promised this, but utterly suck for listening to music or phone).If anyone knows of a device that will deliver on this promise, PLEASE let me know.  I am desperate for something that I can wear while I bike (or ski) that will let me hear.Olive Max disappointed me on so many levels."

111,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wow!  Fantastic!  Great and price is great.,"This works amazing. I was at an ENT office when they told me it would be around 6k for new hearing aids, but then I saw these advertised and wow I am amazed at the quality and saved me thousands of dollars."

With Tweak Enhance on the other hand, I could hear well even at a low volume. It's restaurant mode also cuts down sharp dins, making it usable in noisy clangy environment. (I have the compression set at the max). I highly recommend it especially if you can get it on sale. (I bought it at Best Buy).On the down side, it's Bluetooth connection can get finicky. It didn't work well with my main phone, so I had to grab another phone to get it configured."

118,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Impressed by Quality of These OTC Hearing Aids!,"NOTE: I am a member of the Amazon Vine Program. I try out new products, and then provide an honest, unbiased review, based on my personal impressions and experience. I am not paid for my reviews.These hearing aids are so much more than I expected when I ordered them! They come well-packaged with detailed and user-friendly instructions for set up and to get you connected to the phone app that accompanies the device. Don't worry -- so far, I have only used the app for set up, so don't think you'll have to constantly be reaching for your phone to manage things all the time. In fact, you can easily control power and volume from the hearing aids themselves, and you can use the app pretty intuitively to fine tune high/low frequency levels and balance between left and right. There is an option you can turn on to automaticially reduce wind noise when you are outside. As you can see in a couple of the photos I have included with this review, they are equipped with signal lights to let you know when they are charging (orange) and/or have reached a full charge (green).The adaptive Bluetooth function works well with my iPhone, so now my hearing aids show up as an audio option when I make/receive calls or when I am listening to music or videos from my cell phone, and the sound quality has been great so far.  The adaptive Bluetooth function is an option that can be turned on or off in the app, if you don't want sounds from your phone to project directly to your hearing aids.  If you like this feature, however, you can actually connect to televisions, speakers, and other Bluetooth audio devices, as well, but I have not opted to do so and cannot comment on the quality of that function, other than it is presumably similar to using the Bluetooth connection to my phone.  The built-in microphones work well, too. They are positioned on the piece that fits inside your ear, so the only thing on the ear loop is basically the power/volume control buttons. Also comes with a selection of ear tips in three different sizes, a cleaning brush, and a generous supply of wax guards. I carry the lightweight portable carrying case in my purse now, so that I can easily store my hearing aids if I want/need to remove them while I am away from home.  The only thing I wish was different is the color of the ear pieces, which is black. Because these are not micro devices which can be hidden deep in your ear canal, you can see them, but it's even more apparent because of the black (vs. nude or beige) color of the ear pieces.Most importantly, the sound quality I am experiencing with these hearing aids has exceeded my expectations.  Indeed, it has taken me a little time to get used to hearing my own voice again, so I've appreciated the support documents and videos provided in the app that have very clearly addressed my questions about using these hearing aids so far. Not just the operational aspects about the devices themselves, but more general things like the new sounds I am hearing for the first time in a long time, and tips for adjusting to wearing hearing aids as a new user.For those without insurance, or who don't have thousands of dollars to spend on coinsurance, this is an excellent ""all-inclusive"" package that includes everything you need to wear and take care of your new hearing aids. Yes, it's still pricy, but at less than $1,000 for the pair (and everything that comes with them), the cost is nothing close to what I was being quoted in the hearing specialist's office, and considering the quality of the item I received, I find these devices to be an excellent value."
118,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Expensive but seen to work well,Picked this up for my dad whose hearing is going out. He’s refused to buy hearing aids because he doesn’t like how indiscreet many of them are. Luckily he agreed to try these out mainly because it was at no cost to him and it was from a reputable brand that he’s familiar with.He’s satisfied with the performance though he complains about a few random moments where they make high pitched whining noises. I think that might be a minor issue with the mics amplifying noise as he was able to make it happen by cupping his hands over his ears while the earpieces are in.He continues to use it but he’s now curious about the other model that goes further in the ear and makes it less obvious he’s wearing anything in his ear although the part that sits behind the ear is bulkier.I think this was a good introduction to hearing aids as the benefits for him outweigh his complaints.
118,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good sound but charging case has to be plugged in,"I have now been wearing my Sennheiser All-Day Clear Slim over the counter hearing aids for almost a month and while I like them a lot they can’t do everything the more expensive aids can do, and I am OK with that.  But there is still one thing that I miss.  Here are the pros and cons of a 20 year hearing aid user that has gone through several sets in that time.While for me this was a con for most it will not be an issue.  I have different hearing levels in the 2 ears, and I found in the app the ability to change the sound level between the 2 ears. I needed to reduce the sound in one ear but not the other and the app allowed me to do that.  It did warn me that the levels were significantly different, and I should check with a hearing specialist but allowed me to change them.  However, every time I used the hearing aids to listen to a pod cast via Bluetooth with my iPhone both ears would go back to the level of the loudest and this would be an issue suddenly for me.  For some reason the difference in sound level would not hold.  This is a temporary issue, but it was annoying that it would not stay where I set it.The rest of the pros and consPros – Good sound, this is obviously what everyone wants, and these hearing aids deliver. The size is ok for me and, longer and thinner, they fit well behind my ears with the wires being long enough to fit. You can change the in-ear piece to fit the size of your ear canal.  Different sizes are included. The set comes with a second traveling case different from the charging case, that is form fitted to protect them while they are off the ear and not charging. The price is right. Mic and speaker are both in your hearing aid. You can talk and listen within range of the Bluetooth connection to your smart phone.Cons – The app only gives you 2 choices for different sound settings, automatic and music. The equalizer is rudimentary, and I was not able to tell much difference when trying to use it.The biggest issue is the charging case must be plugged in to charge.  In today’s world, this could be a non-starter.  The fact that I have extra power banks laying around allows me to have a power bank stay with the charging case if I need to charge and can’t plug it into a wall outlet.  This is more often with my line of work than most I admit, but how much would that have set you back? Smartphone connection is, according to my wife, annoying since she hears an echo of herself when talking to me.  The only way to fix that is to stop using the hearing aids as the phone speaker and hold my phone to my ear or or turn on the speaker phone.  Other hearing aids with this capability allowed me to use the mic on the phone and listen through the aids. Putting the aids in the charging case to charge at night can be an issue as they must be firmly set in place and sometimes even reset 2, 3 or 4 times and then on 2 occasions one of them did not charge even though it appeared to be when I went to sleep. The charge is only good for about 12 hours.  I sometimes wear them for 14-16 hours at a time and they run out of charge before I am through.  This was about the same as my last pair so was not surprised but I was hoping for a bit longer.I would recommend them, but I would also recommend using a hearing professional and getting their advise as to what you should be buying based on your budget."
118,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,With a big selling price does have better audio but also some negatives,"At the time I received this, the seller's price was $1,000I am a 73-year-old male with hearing issuesI have tested 4 other OTC hearing aids from Amazon. They were only about $200 a pairWhere they worked they were not flawless as to quality of sound but better than using no hearing aids at allI expected as to the high cost of this hearing aid product to see a real big difference in sound quality and how they functionThis product does in fact have a better audio quality and helps in my case as my hearing in left ear is worse than right ear and this product allows adjusting volumes for 1 or both earsMost cases the sound is clear and not hearing any white or static noise, but in some cases like when in a room with no sound I can hear some noise and no setting other than reducing the volume level betters thisThis product to set up and use really requires you download from Apple or Goggle a cellphone APPNot until you go to install it you find to use this you must agree to allowing them to track you which i see no way they need to know your location just for hearing aids to function or know what else this APP is doing in the blindThe APP has no instructions, so you have to play with it and make judgements as to how to make the setting valid for your hearingThis APP connections to the hearing aids via Bluetooth, the more you have the 2 connected this way the quicker the aid's battery will dischargeThe aids are very small, about 1 inch long and very lightIt has only 1 switch/pushbutton for several different functions. There is no way with the size of aids installed behind the ear to use those, cannot see them, cannot even feel it, so I think all settings have to be done via the cellphone APP. But that means if you do not have the cellphone with you then of course cannot make changes without the APPI asked questions of the seller on their Amazon webpage, they have not repliedOne question is how long will the batteries last before having to be replaced and if I could buy and replace themBest I find in doing search on this produce is battery life is about 2 years or 500 plus chargesThis means for the $1,000 selling price after just 2 years you might not be able to get new batteries or someone to swap with the old onesI noticed in the manual as to operating conditions, it states functioning up to 70% humidity but where I live most of the year for weather daily goes to 100% and maybe lows in the 60-70% so do not know if that affects quality of sound and life of these aidsGoing to the maker's website for this product/model to find the charger requires a humidity filter installed, but the product does not come with one, and you have to buy those as an option, yet I could not find these on their websiteMy concern will be the life of the batteries, the quality of sound when batteries age and if even being able to get new batteries bought and installedLastly these hearing aids allow answering cellphone calls, but since cannot find/reach the button on aids than not a function for me and at least via the Bluetooth is allowing what most cellphones have is via Bluetooth is saying who the caller is to make a judgement to answer that callAlso, I have noticed when checking the cellphone when it was sitting on a table and I in another room, when a call was coming in the hearing aids did not beep to say call coming in and phone showed calls had come inAids do beep when cellphone is close by, so seems to say the Bluetooth receiver for these aids only have a short rangeOnly long term use will answer if these hearing aids are worth the $1,000 selling price"
118,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Works great but picks up all the background noise.,"It works well, the amplification seems to be good. You can adjust the volume as needed and they connect to my iPhone perfectly and I can listen to music. Needs a bit more bass though but still okay. It does pick up a bunch of background noise though but it's OTC and the price is way cheaper than what the doctors wanted to set me up with. So far, it's working well and I can hear much better. Just know it will pick up background noises also. A tiny bit uncomfortable after prolonged use though but it's still very doable, and for the price, It works."
118,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Sennheiser All-Day Clear - OTC Self-Fitting Hearing Aid,"So received these for review. I got them and charged them up and will try to give you as best a review as I can. As a person that hasn't used hearing aids before and considering how expensive they can be, I think these are a bit overpriced. Considering they are Sennheiser, I would think they would have more features and that everything would work as advertised.1. They absolutely don't provide the ability to hear just forward as many hearing aids do.I think much of that is due to design. Trying to get away from big ugly in ear models in favor of a reduced in ear footprint (which they do), I am sure had a lot to do with it. But with many companies supporting smaller and smaller in ear hear aids over the years, this seemed like a no, for back of the ear models.2. They are very light. I barely noticed wearing them, if it wasn't for my glasses I doubt I would give them any attention at all.3. Sound quality. Now here was not a deal breaker, but having owned Sennheiser products, I definitely expected better quality of sound. Highs, mid range and lows are just missing that crispness.  I guess the thought of the day at the time of making these was, ""Well they are hearing aids, not headphones"". Maybe they should of actually thought and built them like they were headphones. While definitely not horrible by any stretch, just expected more for the price. Hearing aids are a big and most times costly expense. To  put your name and not your best foot forward with these, seems a bit short sighted.All in all I would not say ""Don't buy these"". For someone that has major to severe hearing loss, and doesn't currently use a hearing aid, the entrance fee is lower than most, and I don't know that they would not find these absolutely great. I as having only mild hearing loss due to decades in heavy manufacturing, might find these a bit of a let down. I can still hear in most ranges, but at reduced distance. Most conversations in say a noisy restaurant are near impossible, these don't fix that. Their technology for whatever reason, is missing, and again I attribute that to design. But for less noisy environments, these work just fine, just don't expect binaural or stereo quality sound. Maybe next time add a equalizer to your app, as what is there doesn't do it, and would allow the user to adjust these more to what they expect, than expect and not get, and no way to compensate it.4. Battery life. I used these all day for 2 days, and nothing else while I was awake, and didn't charge them till the evening of the 2nd days. So about 16 hours, but they weren't dead, but about 20%. The one caveat I did have was, what to do if I forgot to charge, thinking as a person that has worse hearing issues than me. Well I suggest you don't forget as there are no spare batteries. So something to consider.All in all I gave them 4 stars, as they are useable, the Bluetooth worked great on a newish phone, and it worked with my windows computer (But in fairness, I usually use headphones, but you can't draw a conclusion without using them for that too). I use an android phone and no apple products, so I can't speak to whether they work with them.Buying hearing aids is a big decision, so please choose carefully. Best to talk to friends and people that use them, but don't solely rely on that either. Make sure they are of different brands, not what ARP is pushing this week. They really aren't a good shopping partner, when they are getting a cut of everything they advertise and sell to you. Talk about biased opinions. Find you a good Child or Grandchild that enjoys music to help you decide as well, then you will know what is good or not. Try before you buy is a great motto here."
118,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Takes getting used to,"Review: The Sennheiser All-Day Clear Slim OTC Self-Fitting Hearing Aid has been a game-changer for my mild to moderate hearing loss, offering all-day comfort and clear sound quality. The Bluetooth streaming feature allows me to seamlessly connect to my devices for enhanced listening experiences. FDA cleared and easy to self-fit, this hearing aid provides convenience and reliability for anyone seeking a discreet and effective solution for their hearing needs."
118,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Hear, here","So, since the FDA determined that hearing aids could be sold OTC there has been an influx of brands/sizes/shapes/ etc that resemb;e the cicada influxWith models priced anywhere from $30 to $1,000 or more/less, how do you decideMY advice (and I'm a patient, not a doctor) is: A) First GO TO an audiologist to determine your needB) Find a store that will let you try out a selection (not all that easy as these things DO go into one's ear) C) Look first to names you know (for instance Sennheiser) D) make sure you understand the ease/difficulties of getting the aids to function correctlyThese are pretty good, but they ARE more complex to adjust and they are NOT inexpensiveI WILL be trying them under a variety of circumstances  and if there's anything to report, i'll try to report it"
118,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent OTC hearing aids,"I have been alternating using these hearing aids with my prescription/audiologist pair that I have been using for two years (wearing hearing aids since 2017). Overall, the sound quality is excellent with these Sennheisers and comparable to my older ones that were six times the cost. They are easy to use immediately, charge up quickly and simply in their charging case, and easily stay charged for 18 hours. Electronic beeps and tones from appliances and live piano music sounds are often loud and distorted, but I have the same issue with the older ones. Unlike the more expensive pair, there are very few adjustments that can be made to correct or amplify certain tones. That is generally where the extra cost comes in, because I have an included-in-the-price-audiologist available as needed to make adjustments, which is NOT provided in the Over The Counter (OTC) hearing aids. I have experienced very little feedback/squeel when hugging someone or putting my hand near my ear, which can be common and annoying. Sennheiser is a respected name in the microphone/amplification industry for stage and recording and it shows here. The Bluetooth function for listening to streaming devices or cellphone works extremely well, better than my others. I got no distortion when I put my cell phone in my pocket and I’m listening to a podcast or music through the hearing aids. The Sennheisers have been durable, but I don’t know where to get them repaired when needed, also included in my more expensive pair. Overall, they function very well and are an excellent option if working with an audiologist is out of the question."
118,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Comfortable,"These are comfortable to wear, and the sound quality is fantastic. However, connecting them at first was a bit difficult to do. On top of that, I definitely don't think they are worth the cost they are going for."
118,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,OK,Pretty easy to set up but the fit does take some getting used to. It does make an improvement as I’m able to decipher people that talk soft as well as focus in noisy environments. They charge quickly and the battery lasts the day. I wish they were a bit smaller but other than that they are pretty good.
118,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Kind of difficult,While these seem to be well made but it's difficult to get them to sound right. When I walk into a room with a water feature these seem to boost the sound of the water above the sound of everything else. I'm still working on trying to get it all right but it isn't really easy. The quality of the sound is very high as fitting the Senseinheimer brand but I think having a professional set it up would be helpful as some of the instructions aren't very clear. I'll keep trying.
118,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Better than other OTC hearing aids,"I've used Sennheiser headphones and microphones for years, so I was interested in trying this product. But I was also wary, as Sennheiser was recently sold. After trying this product for a few weeks, my worry was unfounded.Unlike other brands I've tried (Eargo, Sony), this product was easier to set up and to isolate and amplify only the high frequencies I was missing. I tried the other brands first, as I wanted devices that fit completely in the ear canal. But the Sennheisers simply sound better and more natural after easy tweaking via the mobile app. (The app doesn't have what most of us want, the ability to adjust sound as easily as an equalizer provides. You just get basic tonal adjustments, which are insufficient, but better than other brands).The Sennheisers are not perfect, however. All that I've tried suffer from something I cannot stand: Anything with a sustained pitch (a single note being played or maintained in a music soundtrack for a few seconds, a human voice that drags out a sustained note for a moment, etc) is reproduced with a warble, where the pitch noticeably changes up and down just a bit. It's incredibly annoying, as I'm a musician. It renders sound unenjoyable for me. The cause: Manufacturers have installed software to help combat feedback, the squeal you often hear when someone inserts a hearing aid into their ear.Some manufacturers give you a user preference setting to turn off feedback control. Most do not. None of the over-the-counter brands I've tried, including Sennheiser, allow it to be turned off. I'd rather have occasional feedback than continual warbling of tones sustained for any duration. It's like a violin when a performer wiggles her fingers to add vibrato. The pitch oscillates. Sounds great in an orchestra, but not continually from a hearing aid.That said, the Sennheisers have produced zero feedback for me so far, whereas the others did nearly every time when inserting into the ear canal. And the Sennheiser's have the least oscillation to sustained tones. It's still unacceptable to my ear, but what are ya gonna do. I also need to hear better.While the Sennheisers are not invisible in the ear canal and instead are the old style that hangs off the back of the crease in your ear, they aren't as big nor visible as I expected. I don't wear glasses, but when donning sunglasses, the hearing aids are a bit uncomfortable. If I wore regular glasses, I'd need to go for the fully in canal aids.The charging case is simply a poor design. It's huge. The other brands have much smaller cases shaped to slide into your pocket. The Sennheiser case is built like a loaf of bread and it doesn't have to be. Eargo's includes a battery, so you can charge the case and then detach and use the case to recharge your hearing aids. The Sennheiser case is just a hold for the hearing aids that allows you to charge when the case is plugged in. Oddly, when you detach the case, the hearing aids automatically turn on. You won't likely notice this until you later open the case and find the no longer are fully charged. Really annoying and leaves you without hearing aids if you're out in the wild for the day. Other brands don't do that and let you recharge via the case.That said, it's all about the sound. Sennheiser wins, despite the aspects that need improvement.Highly recommended, but keep an eye on the OTC market, which will constantly evolve."
118,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Premium OTC hearing Aid,"Well built, and easy to setup. All day wear allows you to comfortably utilize them for up to 16hrs on a charge. The hearing aids are comfortable and lightweight, and come with multiple size of silicon inserts for an almost custom fit. Case is robust, and the BT streaming is seamless. Volume is good, some noise, but still adequate for low to mid hearing loss customers. Made in Vietnam."
118,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,OTC Hearing Aids,"These OTC hearing aids are well made, they're easy to operate and they come with an easy to navigate app. One thing I don't like about them is the fact that they connect to my phone's audio. I'd prefer they just amplify the sound coming from the phone, rather than connect through Bluetooth. Cuz I can get that effect with earbuds. And I could only wear them for about 30 minutes cuz it felt like they were tickling my ear. I thought that would go away, but it only got worse. So I can't really comment on the battery life."
118,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Exactly what she needed,"affordable. Sennheiser has an excellent reputation for audio equipment (headphones and microphones), so I thought this would be worth a try. Her comments:This one is perfect! The set up was very simple, as the app walked me though each step. In addition, the app includes tips on how to improve the usage of the product and how to adjust to wearing a hearing aid which I found to be extremely helpful.The All-Day Clear hearing aid connects quickly and easily and most importantly, it goes a long way toward improving my hearing. I work in a noisy classroom and often have trouble hearing what my students are saying, even when I get up close to them. Other hearing aids amplified all of the noise in the room, which did nothing to help hearing what I needed to. The clarity of the voices with this hearing aid is excellent, and background noises are kept to a minimum. This took some adjusting of the settings, but once set, the function of this hearing aid is wonderful.Other added niceties are the fact that the All-Day Clear connects through my phone so I don’t have to use additional head phones or earbuds; it also recharges easily in the case so I just put them in their case out at night and they are ready to go in the morning. I also like the fact that it is pretty small. I wear my hair very short, so it is visible, but small and discreet. With longer hair it would not be visible at all. The All-Day Clear comes with a variety of ear pieces to enable you to find the right fit; I found it to be a good fit and comfortable even when wearing throughout the work day.The function, ease and look of the All-Day Clear hearing aid are all more than satisfactory!"
118,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best hearing aid I've used.,"Wow, what a difference in noise cancellation of background noise compared to my $5000 dollar pair!  I can't believe the difference in these for $300 dollars.  They are easy to connect and are very comfortable.  I would actually take my other set out of my ears because they picked up all the noises around me and drove me crazy.  Not these, they are actually what they say they are, good quality with noise cancellation and comfortable!"
118,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sennheiser hearing aid,Premium OTC hearing aid. Very nice set with many features.
118,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,They make a difference!,"The Sennheiser All-Day Clear Self-Fitting Hearing Aid interacts well with the app and allows all adjustments to be made using the All-Day-Clear app.  They take some getting used to, however they work well in environments where external noise can be a distraction, or while watching TV, listening to conversation, etc.Setting them up is a breeze.  The app does most of the heavy lifting.  Listening to music, answering calls and speaking on the phone works well.My only real criticism with these would be that the case doesn’t have a built in battery.  You have to be connected to a power cord to recharge the hearing aids.  The charging cable is also a bit ‘old school’.  Rather than USB-C, it uses a micro USB cable to connect to the charging brick.  For the cost of these, the case should recharge the devices, similar to AirPods or Bose Quiet Comfort, but they are certainly comfortable, easy to set up and being over the counter available, can save you a costly trip to an audiologist.Pretty easy to recommend!"
118,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Compares favorably to a prescription set,"This is my second pair of hearing aids.  My first were over 4K list with an audiologist testing, fitting, and making adjustments, etc.The app on that pair was very sophisticated with multiple settings, etc.  But bottom line, while they were helpful, I could not tell that they made that much difference.  After a 60 day trial I returned them.  I simply could not justify the cost for the slight difference that they made.I decided to give these a try, based largely on the Sennheiser name and reputation, since I use their microphones and other equipment professionally.Imagine my surprise when I found that they worked just as well as the other set for a fraction of the cost.The app with this pair is, by comparison, very basic.  Only a couple of settings and the ability to fine tune is limited.That said, they compare very well on battery life and the fit and finish, being all but invisible to others unless they look for them.In addition, and not surprising, they are BETTER for streaming music via Bluetooth. That makes sense given Sennheiser's long experience in the sound industry.Like the expensive set I had, these still do not help that much when I'm in a crowd trying to hear one person with a high voice, but they  DO help and for the price, I'm glad I have them."

118,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Finally! High Quality OTC hearing aids.,"On day 4 with these hearing aids.  Let me start that they have been superb thus far here's a short list of pros and cons:PROExtremely comfortable for all day wear.Battery life has been excellent.  Easily getting 16 hours a day with moderate streaming involved.Hearing aids are very effective at enhancing voices.  The initial setup process helps you dial them in really well but I would add that you might want to overshoot your settings just a little on The initial setup process.  Set these up just a little louder than you think you'll need and you'll be fine.  I went thru the setup process a second time because I didn't think the volume was as loud as I needed.Literally set and forget.  Unlike other hearing aids I have purchased I don't have to fiddle with these things constantly trying to tweak the sound.CONS:I wish the battery case contained a battery for ease of topping off during the day but, since the battery life has been so solid on these I guess I really don't need to and it's really not that big of a con.You'll want to balance the volume of the various sound profiles. Initially the Bluetooth volume was a little high so when my phone transitioned to Bluetooth background noise increased significantly.  But once you get that dialed in there's really not much difference between the two profiles volume wise.Bluetooth connectivity for streaming has been just a little sketchy.  This seems like it's prone to connecting and disconnecting when you first establish a stream.  However it seems to work itself out after a couple of minutes.  I don't know if it's a Bluetooth fault with earpieces or my phone.Fidelity is not at all what I expected from Sennheiser.  Yes I know the RIC earpieces are probably very small balanced armature drivers and I shouldn't expect much from them.  But have used used many Sennheiser products over the years and I just expected a little better sound.  They're perfectly adequate I just expected a little more.And that's pretty much it for these.  I am so glad I went ahead and spent the money on them..... you literally get what you pay for these days. That being said they sound better than my prescription hearing aids I got from Costco which I believe were phonak brands and considerably more expensive.  They  surpass the phonaks in ease of use and overall quality.Save up and buy them.  You won't be disappointed.Update... It turns out the Bluetooth difficulties I encountered were the fault of my phone.  I just purchased a new Samsung Galaxy s23 ultra and Bluetooth is flawless."
118,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent fit great sound quality,My All Day Clear hearing aids work great! I have to check occasionally to make sure they’re still on because they are so comfortable and the sound is natural. I love the live music setting also. Being a musician I appreciate the quality of the sound from my instrument as well as others when listening to a live performance. And I found out that we do have birds singing in our back yard!
118,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,A Game-Changer for Dad's Hearing!,"I got my 72-year-old dad the Sennheiser hearing aid, and oh boy, it's a total game-changer! Dad's been dealing with some hearing trouble for a while, but this device has turned things around big time.Being far away from him, I sent the aid his way, and he managed to set it up all by himself using YouTube. Easy peasy! Now, he's raving about how it's like night and day. In group chats, he used to miss out on voices, but not anymore. He's hearing everyone loud and clear, even when Mom calls him from another room.And let's talk about phone calls—total transformation! No more struggles during family calls or chatting with the grandkids. He catches every word crystal clear. Plus, he's rocking two phones, and guess what? The Sennheiser aid plays nice with both of them. Super convenient!The best part? He can now answer all his calls hassle-free. The headset is sleek and subtle, so he's not shouting to the world about his hearing aid. Dad's thrilled, and I bet this review will help someone else make a smart decision. Sennheiser, you nailed it!"
118,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,No help in a noiesy situation.,"In many ways these hearing aids are not bad. Good connection to the app. Good connection to cell phone. These amplify sound and have treble and bass control. The slim model fit well. But I own an old Bose hear-phone and for a lot less money the hear-phone is superior. Hear-phone looks very obvious and sadly it is no longer available. I will keep my old hear-phone as long as it works. Later I hope to find something which can focus sound source to reduce overall room noise even better than the hear-phone.Update 1/28/24TI have been using these for over two months now.  They are very much worth the money.  I use them all the time I use my computer or cell phone.  They are the best ""head phones"" that I have ever had.  And they also are hearing aids at the same time.  Comments above about noisy places still applies.  But I'll now increase my rating to 4 stars."
118,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent OTC hearing aids!!,"Prior to these hearing aids, I wore Phonak Virto B-Titanium IIC for the last 6 years.My audiologist recommended I move to an over the ear hearing aid as my Phonak was unable to correct hearing in my left ear.I have severe hearing loss in my left ear and moderate in my right ear.I decided to try these hearing aids but was worried it wouldn't help my left ear as they are listed for mild to moderate hearing loss.  These hearing aids are amazing and I hear better than ever. Technology is amazing in any type of situation you might find yourself in.  Background noise is not an issue with these hearing aids.If you are looking for a great pair of hearing aids at a good price, don't hesitate to try these!!!"
118,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wow! Sennheiser gets OTC hearing aids right!!,"I had Jabra hearing aids from Costco. They cost roughly twice what I paid for these.  It took a lot of effort and multiple visits to Costco to get them set up to where they were mostly OK. These took maybe 3 hours and I did it myself.  The sound is amazing.  I love music and now I can hear it again.  And the bluetooth actually works!  The Jabras would disconnect from my phone, first one ear then both. I couldn't take phone calls on the hearing aids. I couldn't listen to a book while walking with the phone in my back pocket, the sound would break up and be distorted. With the Sennheisers, the bluetooth streaming is flawless.  I bought these expecting that I would be returning them, I have been so disappointed by OTC hearing aids.  Until now.  I don't think I will be returning them after all.The app is decent but really needs a few changes.  For one thing, it should be possible to set up a profile using live sound instead of the pre-recorded voice talking.  When you go to edit a profile it should show you what the current values are rather than reset them each time.  Multiple profiles would really help too."
118,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent OTC Hearing Aids,"I have worn prescribed hearing aids for over 10 years. The last pair was made by Widex. I had constant problems with those and finally one of them quit working completely. I've tried two other OTC models, including the first ones Jabra put out. I was really hoping they would work. After wearing them a few hours, they became uncomfortable. They also had drop-out problems so I returned them. I've worn the Sennheiser for two weeks now and think they are better than prescribed hearing aids. They are more comfortable and I really like the rechargeable feature. The only option I wish they had was a quick way to turn them off. I discovered when placing them in the case, they are still connected, which drains the power if not plugged in. Very nice hearing aids! I hope the last a long time and I highly recommend them."
118,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Hard of hear,Don't buy if you are severely hard of hearing
118,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Affordable good quality. Easy to use.,Quality for price. The quality is very good. I would like the app to have a better frequency adjustability. These are much more affordable and adequate than the $2500.00 per side from the local specialist. No waiting either. The next appointment locally is 10 weeks out.
118,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,disappointed,"The price of $1400 is very high for what it offers with one of $300. For those who need a Hearing Aid, hearing aid amplification is essential according to the Sennheiser All-Day Clear manual, this is left in the middle, simultaneous Bluetooth connection with a second device at the same time is not possible."
118,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,All day clear app not available in App store(iphone) canada,I am using iphone in Canada. All day clear app is not available in app store.  Please rectify.  Your prompt action is required in order to avoid. return.Your prompt reply much appreciated.
118,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not easy to pair. Not holding charge.,No comment! Didn’t get to try them out!
118,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Problem w/APP to make them work,"APP had a problem and so I could not get them to work. Contact phone number for seller was to a massage parlor, so could not contact seller for help. Took 4 days before I got a return address. The mailing label says I have to pay return postage and it doesn’t say which shipping service to use. This will be the first time I have ever had to pay to return something purchased through Amazon. Was really hoping these hearing aids would be as good as Sennheiser microphones. Guess I will never know and maybe a good thing with this type of customer service."

118,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,App unavailble,App does not download on  an Iphone bought in Canada. Must be a phone bought in the US
118,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,My dad has been enjoying them!!,"I ordered these hearing aids for my dad who has mild hearing loss. He was stoked to try them and see if they could help. The first thing he loved about them was the design and the way they look when he wears them. He says they aren't very noticeable like others he tried,  and he likes how discreet they are. He says they are very comfortable and fit in his ears well, he is able to wear them all day with no problem. They were simple to set up and installing the app on his phone was quick.  He is impressed with the sound quality as well, says they are loud, clear, and even sounding, and are definitelyan upgrade to his last pair. He enjoys that they have Bluetooth so he can listen to his music or answer phone calls hands free. Plus they have a long lasting battery, so he is able to use them most of the day without having to recharge. So far he really enjoys them and has had only minor sound issues, but for the most part they have been working great. He is happy since he can hear way better than before, so these hearing aids are truly an amazing gift for him."
118,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Work well and an excellent value,"My husband recently had one of his hearing aids fail and then not long after he misplaced one of them. Now, his hearing aids are prescription and cost thousands of dollars, so he was starting to look into OTC models because he wasn't sure he wanted to spend that much again, because OTC models are getting better and cheaper. Fortunately, the repair of the failing piece was only $200, and he found the missing one. But being without his hearing aids for a few days made him want to get some OTC hearing aids as a backup at the very least. Needless to say, he was super-excited to try these out -- and he really likes them. He says they are not as good as his high-end prescription hearing aids, but nevertheless very, very good and given how much cheaper the list price is, an excellent value given the quality.He was quickly able to fit and adjust them with the app -- he said the app is easy to follow and makes the manual unnecessary. The fit is comfortable and the sound is clear. Though he said in music mode the bass is weak. He doesn't like that the charger and the travel case are so large.From my point of view, they work well (he can hear me, and he doesn't have to blast the TV or radio or his video games). They look pretty good -- if you've got salt-and-pepper hair, the color blends well. The wire is a bit thicker and the piece that goes in the ear is a bit larger than his prescription hearing aids, but these are still pretty sleek looking and not that noticeable.In short, if you have mild to moderate hearing loss and can't afford or don't want to spend thousands of dollars for hearing aids, these are an excellent choice."
118,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Pretty good,"Maybe unfair, but I'm comparing these to my hearing aids I got at the audiologist for a lot more money.  I have an unusual low frequency hearing loss that is hard to adjust for.  I wanted to give these a shot to see if they were different than the others, as I am still having problems hearing.I had some trouble setting up the aids.  I tried multiple times, but the right aid connected immediately to my Pixel phone, but the left continued to fail.  So I called the support number, and surprisingly I got hold of someone who actually knew what they were doing, rather than a first-line support person reading from a script.  He correctly went right to the problem, that Pixel phones required a reboot to make the second aid connect.  Reboot, connected right up, and good to go.I have hearing test results, and I was hoping for a way to actually get into some precise adjustments.  However, all that is provided is a fairly generic 2-step process, one that adjusts volume, another for clarity, and that's all.  I was really disappointed it did not give me a way to fine-tune.Anyway, the test I chose was an online speech in noise test.  I honestly did not score very well even with my more expensive hearing aids.  But I was able to make out some of the spoken digits in the white noise.  With the Sennheisers, I could not hear the digits in the noise at all.  I was really disappointed.I still give 4 stars, as I think someone with more normal hearing loss would really benefit from these, and pay a lot less than at an audiologist.  They do seem to be very good quality."
118,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,So much I didn't even know I couldn't hear before,I've abused my ears for decades from working on jets to listening to heavy metal at top volume. I never really thought I had a problem with my hearing but have had difficulty understanding conversations at times and it seems to be more frequent. I had thought about trying some sort of hearing aid but never got around to it. Most are either very expensive from a hearing specialist or are just cheap amplifiers. I didn't know Sennheiser made OTC hearing aids but I have had experience with some of their higher end headphones so when I saw these I figured I could trust the quality and would give them a try.I went to their website first and ran the online hearing test twice. The first time I used a pair of Sony WH-1000XM4 headphones with noise cancelling turned off and connected to my iPhone and it said that I had mild hearing impairment. That didn't surprise me. But just to be safe I ran the same test on my laptop using a pair of Sony MDR-7506 headphones. This time it said I had good hearing. I know the wired headphones have better response than the wireless so your results may vary depnding on the quality of the device you use to test.After that I downloaded and ran the setup of the app. I didn't like having to install an app and create an account. I can excuse the app since there needs to be some way to tune/customize the aids but I don't see the need for creating a login. Once the account was created setup and pairing was relatively easy and it explained the settings pretty good. They inserted easily and I could tell the difference right away. I could turn the TV down quite a bit and hear it fine. But it was a bit odd because I could now hear the crickets outside clearly and also the cooling fan on my laptop.I normally don't like anything inserted in my ears. I have a high end set of UltraEars in-ear monitors and while they give me the best sound for music I can't wear them for long as my they start to itch and get sweaty so I normally use my cheaper over ear headphones for listening for any length of time. I can't use earbuds for the same reason. I kept the medium tips and they don't fit super tight so they were a bit more comfortable while still giving decent sound.I ran into one problem because I wear glasses and their earpieces rub on the top of the aids and gave me a bunch of noise whenever I moved around. I also noticed some crackling noise almost like crinkling paper or plastic when I moved around that seemed to be separate from what my glasses caused.I don't think I would ever use these for making phone calls. I did try listening to music through them just because I could but the sound quality was not good enough for me to ever attempt it again. I even tried adjusting the 3 band equalizer but it didn't really help much. I also noticed that when making adjustments in the app that the response was slow between making the adjustment and it taking effect in the aids so you have to slowly make an adjustment and wait to hear the results.Understand that I have never used any hearing aid before and have nothing to compare these to so this may all be normal. I'll keep wearing them for a while to see if I get used to them. They definitely make things clearer and I can hear things that I couldn't before. I may have to work with the settings too.
118,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,I highly recommend the All-Day Clear Slim,"I was on the hunt for new hearing aids that had to check a few boxes and these do it all very well!- Full Android integration- Rechargeable- Quick and easy setup- Application easy to use- All-day comfortI highly recommend the All-Day Clear Slim.The first draw for me was full Android integration, no holding my phone up to speak into as with other brands, these have microphones built into the earbud style receiver and the audio is crisp and clear for in-person conversation and Bluetooth streaming.I really like the form factor too, the Slim version tucks behind my ear very well with or without my glasses, the slightly larger wire feels more durable than others I've used, these seem to have a bit more deeper (less tinny) tone than others I've used, and the larger earbud-style in-ear receiver is stout and very comfortable for all day long usage. This style feels much more natural to me with less of a plugged ear feel than the smaller ones I've used before.I've had store bought HA's with custom programming which is nice for people who need it or don't know what to expect or understand about getting used to integrating any HA's into their life. If you're patient and have an understanding of the adjustment period of getting used to HA's then these are a great contender for the over-the-counter (OTC) market.I really like the application and setup of these, it's quick and simple for do-it-yourself at home and gives you some simple adjustments. After the quick initial profile setup be sure to adjust the EQ to ensure these are really dialed in for you. Alternatively, you can pay for the additional in-office service they offer through a network of providers, make note that network isn't huge so be sure to check their website for details if that is something you need/want. Also, purchasing that extra service extends your warranty by another year too.I really like these are rechargeable and last all day. The only thing I dislike is the charging case itself. It's very large and only works when plugged into the wall. The case doesn't have an internal battery to allow additional charging on the go. These HA's do last all day so probably isn't a big deal for most but the ability to travel over a weekend with a smaller recharging case would have been perfect for me. The Slims also come with an additional small non-charging storage case which is nice."
118,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good OTC hearing aids, missing some ""higher end"" features","Setup was straight forward.  Bluetooth connection to my phone (Android) and laptop  (Windows 11) was not a problem.  Button controls work but the timing seems longer than the manual states: it takes 6 seconds to turn the devices off while the manual says 4 seconds.  Not a big deal.  Sound amplification is clear, I can hear things I haven't heard since my last hearing aids died.So, what's missing?There are only 3 bands for adjustment: bass, mid and treble.  10 or more bands would enable the hearing  aids to be better adjusted to individual needs.  Increasing the treble helped for my high frequency issues and the midrange helped for consonants (""fifty"" can be distinguished from ""sixty"").  Finer adjustments  would be more helpful.There is no ""automatic noise canceling"" feature which would make the hearing aids more useful in noisy environments.  I'll be using them on a long flight in a few weeks and I'm afraid they will pickup all the airplane noises.  Setting the hearing aids to ""automatic"" and letting music play via Bluetooth should stop the noise amplification.There are no directional controls: you can't tell the hearing aids to ignore sound behind you and emphasize sound in front of you (helpful for TV or movies that don't have surround sound, or in a noisy restaurant).When compared to my previous hearing aids ($6400 and needed frequent repair/replacement during 3 year warranty, then became unusable after the warranty expired) these are a good alternative ($1000).  Time will tell how long they will work.  With any luck, the next replacement will be to upgrade to better features not replace unusable devices."
118,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Surprisingly good for an OTC and for the price!,"I acquired this hearing aids as part of a campaign from #Reviewclub.I needed to buy these ones twice because Amazon sent me laundry product instead of the HAs due to a problem in their warehouse and still waiting for my refund (I will update my review if I don't receive my refund).As a prescription hearing aids user since 2019, My goal is to find a better option for much less price as second or emergency HAs, but surprisingly I can say I can use these ones as primary ones.PROS- Sound quality is exceptional. Including bluetooth audio streaming for phone calls and music from the phone (iphone user). Comparable with my ReSound same RIC style) and Starkey ITE I have. Obviously you won't have the bass as earbuds because the dome. Also the mic sound for phone calls and bluetooth distance range are really good.- Customizable by your own on 3 easy steps thru the app. The app plays a conversation streaming to the HAs and you select the clarity and volume level that fits you and that's it.- App usability, very simple and easy. You can adjust volume and Equalize bass, Mid and Treble. Also activate wind noise reduction.- Noise reduction, I didn't detect yet bad things here. They  work very well doing it automatically.- Battery, surprisingly last more than my day entire day, sometimes I don't charge them at night and last till next mid day.CONS- You are not able to upload your own custom hearing profile from your audiologist. And the option for 250usd is not available because there is no audiologist in my area, which is odd not having one in Clarlotte NC area.- Domes. 3 domes size are delivered. The best sound is the bigger dome but I got occlusion effect (you hear your own voice and body internal sound louder) but you get the best sound in terms of clarity and bass. I needed to change to a smaller one to avoid occlusion effect but loosing the full benefit.- Sound Profiles, You can only select 2 profiles: Automatic and Live Music. And you can't create your own sound profiles in the app.- With the app you can't customize other advanced settings that are available for prescription HAs. Like AI or focused on any direction.- The charger need to be connected to the power. I have seen others with battery to recharge it giving you flexibility.- Sometimes if you are using your phone for music or videos, the phone automatically change the sound output to the HAs automatically. There is no way to configure this behavior, you need to shutdown the Bluetooth.Overall these OTCs are really good and at good price. I would ask for a little discounted price just because you can't upload your own hearing profile and need to pay for it going to an specific audiologist when you could do it by your own thru the app.  Otherwise I can live with these for daily use and replace my prescription ones entirely."
118,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Big Disappointment!,"I was really looking forward to using these hearing aids. Got them delivered today, charged them for the required three hours, the green lights lit up, put them in my ears and nothing! Dead silence regardless of what I did with the buttons! I’ll definitely be sending these back!"
118,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,I like the way it looks on me,"The All-Day Clear App was easy to download and use. The hearing aids fits well and the appearance looks nice. Some of the features I to get use to, like to increase volume you have to quickly press the push button on the right hearing and to decrease you have to quickly press the push button on the left hearing aid. The sound is clear and overall I like the hearing aids."
118,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,I would definitely purchase again,"I researched many brands of hearing aids before deciding to try these Sennheiser All-Day Clear.  I decided on Sennheiser because they are owned by Sonova who also owns Phonak (a well know hearing aide brand).  The day I received the hearing aids, I first charged them for about 2 hours.  They came with a slight charge, so it didn’t take long before they were ready to try.  I downloaded the All-Day Clear app and followed the easy prompts to configure them.  The hearing aids come with 3 sizes of rubber tips and the medium size is pre-installed.  I used the small size which fit perfectly in my ears.  They also come with  replacement wax guards to help keep wax from clogging and affecting the hearing aids.  At first, it took a few tries of putting on the hearing aids to get a good seal inside my ear.The app: the app walks you through each step: connecting them through Bluetooth, setting the volume for both left and right ears, and frequency adjustments.  It took about 20 minutes to fully set-up.  Once configured, you can adjust the volume of each individual hearing aid or both together.  You can also turn on or off the wind noise reduction setting and change the sound mode selection.  It took a few days to get used to how well the hearing aids work, and I would make small adjustments within the app to change the volume depending on the ambient noise around me.The hearing aids: These hearing aids are very small and discreet.  I will reemphasis, very small.  So small that I’ve had multiple people notice I’m able to hear them much better and clearer, they’ve asked me if I was wearing hearing aids because they couldn’t see any.  They are very light weight also.  Once I figured out the proper way to insert the earpiece in my ear canal, I forget I’m wearing them.  These take about 4 hours to fully charge when the battery is depleted but last all day.  I have not had to remove and charge them during the day.  The Bluetooth feature has worked flawlessly with my iPhone.  I can clearly hear the person on the other end and they can clearly hear me.  It’s very convenient to make and receive calls without having to hold my phone to my ear or use the speaker phone.The charging case:  The charging case is much larger than necessary.  One good thing about the size, it’s hard to misplace it.  The hearing aids come pre-installed in ear charging port but not fully charged.  To charge, simply plug the case into the included USB cable and wall wart and place the hearing aids in each charging port.  You can charge them with the lid open or closed.  I usually charge them with the lid open so I can see the charge status.  The case does not have an exterior charge status.  The hearing aids will show charge status through a light on each one.  Once charged, the hearing aids will have a solid green light on each one.  One important note, if you remove the USB cable from the case, the hearing aids will automatically power on.  You can turn them off by pressing and holding the button on each aid for 4 seconds until the light turns red.I highly recommend these hearing aids for anyone with hearing loss.  These hearing aids are not inexpensive but thousands less than purchasing through an audiologist.  I didn’t realize how bad my hearing had become till the purchased these.  They have made a world of difference."
118,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Effective but not efficient,"First off, the unboxing was simple and standard.  The box was secure and well-packaged.  It comes with a Type-C to attach to the base for charging, and a separate travel case.  The app was easy to download and pair the aids.  On to the good vs. bad-The good was sound quality.  They paired with an apple device and worked relatively seamlessly.  Some times it wouldn't connect and on their own, with normal handset use, they did not amplify sound.  The true bad, and real disappointment was size and fit.  They proved to be uncomfortable after a short time, and were more bulky than a similarly priced brand.  Unfortunately, they will get limited use.  For the price, they should be thinner, and more secure-this was using the smallest available mold."

118,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Old tech, weak app, terrible in noisy environments, and overpriced.","There is good and bad to these, but since you probably most need to know the downsides, I'll start there.1. These seem to be based on very old tech from the Phonak Marvel range of hearing aids.  That puts them two generations behind current hearing aids.  (Phonak and Sennheiser hearing aids come from the same parent company.)  So you are spending a hefty chunk of money for very old technology.2. These perform very poorly in noisy environments, such as restaurants.  That's especially true if they have music playing.  The Sennheisers amplify everything, including the music coming from behind me and the guy talking loudly two tables over and a little behind me.3. No front-focus or restaurant mode.  The app is so limited and restricted that you only have two settings: automatic and music.  There is no way to control the focus of the sound to only amplify what is in front of you.  That is a common and very important feature in hearing aids and to see it missing here is baffling.  The automatic mode does not work well enough to do without this.4. Lots of hiss / floor noise, especially in quiet environments.  I find I have to turn these down quite a bit to get the hiss to a tolerable level when at home with my spouse.  A little hiss is not uncommon for hearing aids, but this seems much more than it should be.5. Professional programming upsell is expensive and not refundable.  They charge you $250 to have a professional program these for you and that is not refundable.  It's a huge gamble to take if you find these insufficient right out of the box.6. There are MUCH better values out there for only a little more.  Most important is the Jabra Pro 20 and Philips 9040 (soon 9050) hearing aids from Costco.  Those will run a few hundred more than the Sennheisers, but they are current tech (especially the Jabras), come with professional programming and fitting, a free hearing test, excellent support, cleaning and maintenance accessories, a great warranty, and more. And everything is included with the price of their hearing aids, and it is fully refundable with a pretty long trial / refund period.  Even with the cost of 60 for a Costco membership, it's a much better value.6. No options for longer receiver cables.  The main part of the device sits behind the ear, with a thin cable that goes to the receiver inside your ear canal.  The problem for me and a good number of other people is that the cable is sometimes too short and the hearing aid ends up sitting high on the ear, being very visible, or the cord won't sit flat against the face.  That also makes it harder to wear glasses.  Another reason to opt for a professional fitting at Costco or a similar place.However, there are some good things about these that set them apart:1. Bluetooth classic connectivity.  Most hearing aids still need an adapter to connect to Windows computers and other classic bluetooth devices.  That's changing, but right now Phonak / Sennheiser is about the only brand of hearing aid that has strong bluetooth connectivity to Windows devices.  They also work well with older Android devices.  Note that this makes no difference to iPhone and M-processor Mac users, nor people with the newest Samsung devices, but for others it may matter.  Adapters for other hearing aids to connect to Windows machines can be had for ~40 used up to 300 new.2. Good battery life.  I never ran these down below 30%, even wearing them for 17+ hours straight with a few hours of streaming in the mix.3. Build quality seems solid.  No complaints at all.  The device appears to be made well, even if it is old tech.4. Pretty natural sound.  The sound quality is pretty good and the sound around me seems quite natural.  The streaming quality isn't the best, but that is pretty much always true of hearing aids.For me, personally, these are just not worth the price when I can get something so much better from Costco.  I am returning these and will get the Jabra Pro 20s instead.  It will cost me 600 more, but consider it would cost 250 more to get the Sennheisers properly programmed and maybe get longer receiver cables, and even then I would be using older tech, I just can't justify keeping these.  They were a real disappointment, especially given the strengths of the Sonova/Phonak brands and the premium Sennheiser name.  In the end, these fail to live up to any of those brands' reputations and, ultimately, make me less likely to look at their hearing aids in the future."
118,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Rivals more expensive Rx Hearing Instruments,"What an exceptional product. Comfortable to wear for long periods, helpful in short bursts, battery life is plentiful, and the build material rivals professional instruments. The app is easy to set up and use, and the sound quality is exceptional for mild loss, especially in those hard-to-hear environments. A+ from me. I also purchased the other style variant, which is top-notch."
118,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice quality and comfortable hearing aides,"I was pleasantly surprised to see these OTC hearing aids on Amazon and decided to give them a try as my Wife has been encouraging me for a while to get evaluated for hearing aids.These are simple to setup, with an app to control the settings and a nice (although rather large) charging case.I have been wearing them for about a week so far and they make a big difference in my ability to hear people speak, as well as other noises I was unaware of before.So far I’m very happy with them and they are performing exceptionally well for me. I’ll update this review if there are any developments, but I’m optimistic they are going to make a positive difference! Recommend!"
118,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,I can't believe how well these work,"First things first, when the box arrives everything is so well engineered that just opening it you know that you are getting something special.  You are immediately introduced with the instructions, then the device is is the next piece, and there is a ""drawer"" that slides out and unfolds that contains the accessories such as a carrying case, ear wax removal tools and additional soft ear pieces.  At first it was difficult to figure out how to get them to function, you will need to download the app and everything worked perfect including the app which is half of the problem with devices that use apps as the primary control module.  I also love that they don't look like what you would think a hearing aid looks like, they actually look very modern and like you are wearing ear pods.  Yes it is very expensive, but worth the price for what you get."
118,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Dramatically better than my prescription hearing aids,"I've tried multiple hearing aid solutions from Amazon, and none of them were very good.  I eventually was able to get a set of prescription hearing aids from the VA, and while they were miles away better than anything I'd tried before, there were still some issues with the sound and functionality, but I was told that was just par for the course.  Turns out that wasn't true, because the Sennheiser hearing aids are fantastic.  The clarity of the audio is outstanding, and using the app, you can adjust your audio to boost the bass or treble.  That feature alone has made a massive difference in how well I can hear now.  The bluetooth connectivity is great, and I've kind of become an audiobook junkie because of it.  The battery lasts all day without any trouble (another big improvement over my old hearing aids), and they charge very quickly. These have become my new daily go-tos, and if you're on the fence about these, I'd recommend getting them."
118,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Rolls Royce of Hearing Aids,"The Sennheiser All-Day Clear - OTC is a very high end premium solution hearing aid.  It is made by the trusted brand Sennheiser and provides all day comfort in wearing.  The fit is universal amongst ear types with the in-ear bud easily maneuverable to seat inside your canal.  From there, you can also control the ADC1 will the abundance of controls to adjust according to your hearing needs.  The Sennheiser All-Day Clear - OTC is FDA cleared, very lightweight and secure in fit when placed behind your ear.  I was able to get up to 16 hours usage in my testing and all communications while wearing were clear and crisp.  This is a very high end premium priced hearing aid and you truly do get what you pay for in a comprehensive item.  I highly recommend this for purchase in your mild to moderate hearing aid solution."
118,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent Hearing Aid,"These are fantastic because they provide clear sound all day long. The Sennheiser All-Day Clear is easy to fit and comfortable to wear. Only downside is they are a bit expensive, but worth it for the quality."

This review is a Sennheiser All-Day Clear Slim Self-Fitting Hearing Aid.  They call them hearing aids, but if you continue reading about the product, they say they’re for mild to moderate hearing loss, which would describe them more accurately.  I have had a lot of different amplifiers in my day, and the biggest issues are usually the fit and I can hear my hair moving back and forth.  These are different, they’re lightweight, they fit around my smaller ears, the earpieces fit nicely, and I couldn’t hear my hair moving back and forth in front of them.  Something that’s cool is they automatically optimize the sounds around me, and what that means is they control the volume, and I don’t get blasted with sounds as I walk around the house.  Another plus is they connect to Bluetooth, so I can use them with my laptop, iPad, iPhone, and I can use the app to adjust settings while I wear them.  I like and recommend these amplifiers for all the above, and for the great clear sound."
118,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,The best hearing assistance,Sound is adjustable manually or through the app. App isn't necessary when wearing these and sound is clear. Charges quickly and comes with different sizes depending on size of ear for comfort and audio. Due to low hearing I used to talk louder than I needed too and now talk softly and I'm able to enjoy my music and talking with friends a lot more. This hearing device has many features to accommodate what a person needs to improve their hearing. It does connect easily with my phone when my signal is working properly.
118,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Rechargeable batteries,After doing a little research I ordered the all day clear hearing aids. They look to be a pretty good brand. The batteries are rechargeable and have a battery life of 16 hours. They are taking some time to get used to. I'm not used to having something stuck in my ears. It took some time to configure and get them adjusted to where they're working well for me. So far everything is working good with no complaints.
118,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Unbelievably high sound quality,"As someone who has been dealing with mild to moderate hearing loss, finding the right hearing aid has been a journey. As a music producer and DJ, I spent too many years listening to extremely loud music and it has taken it's toll on my hearing. I knew about Sennheiser since I have experience with their studio monitor headphones which were some of the best I've ever used. I first tried some lower budget hearing aids which turned out to be garbage. So I recently decided to try these Sennheiser All-Day Clear Slim, and I have to say, it's been a game-changer. The self-fitting feature made setup a breeze, and the slim design is comfortable for all-day wear. What really sets this hearing aid apart is its Bluetooth streaming capability, allowing me to seamlessly connect to my devices for crystal-clear audio. Whether I'm on a call or listening to music, the sound quality is top-notch. Plus, being FDA cleared gives me peace of mind knowing it meets rigorous safety standards. If you're looking for a hearing aid that combines comfort, clarity, and convenience, the Sennheiser All-Day Clear Slim is worth considering."
118,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Lives up to its name,Its a Sennheiser and the name speaks for itself . Got it for my elder in the house and she is so happy using it. Small enough and crystal clear sound. Comes with a charging cable/case and well packaged box with instruction manual. Easy to use too.Bit pricey but you wont regret!!
118,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent quality for OTC,These self-fitting hearing aids are excellent quality for OTC. Sound quality is great. Comfortable fit. Worth every penny. I recommend.
118,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,They are more than I expected ！！,"Product support, hearing aid performance, app ease-of-use… all exceeds my expectation!"
118,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great hearing aids,"These work great and feel great. They are very difficult to see and the battery life is pretty good. I love the Bluetooth features and I highly recommend these. These are about 1/6th the cost of the more expensive hearing aids, so they're a great value."
118,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,The clarity of the sound is great,"The media could not be loaded.
                



The pros are the sound clarity, and being able to control the hearing aids through the app. The fit is okay and I am able to wear the hearing aids all day with no problems.The cons are if you have small ears the appearance is not flattering. The travel case should be able to charge the hearing aids and carry the charging cord. The charging case that comes included is a little too bulky to travel with."
118,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love them!,"This is my second style of OTC hearing aids I have tried and I have quickly noticed some positive differences. The other set I have is more of a ""ear bud"" style which I did originally like because they looked like regular wireless ear buds and they were pretty small. However, battery life wasn't ideal for all day usage with those more of just a pop them in when there is a reason to hear better kind of set-up. Originally I was hesitant for this style thinking that they would be a little unsightly for my age bracket (sub 40 years old). While I probably wont be gaining any style points at the club these are barely noticeable and substantially more comfortable to use over the entire day. Having the wire go from the ear piece to the body behind the lobe provides good weight distribution and better comfort. I had no issues using the medium size ear insert that comes pre-installed but they do also include a small and large set for other ear shapes. These offer much better battery life than the ear bud style, I would imagine also being contributed to the design to allow more space for a larger battery. The charging case is pretty large and bulky, but it does use USB-C thankfully, they do also include USB-C cord as well. This is a huge necessity for me especially since I'm on the go a lot. I am able to get 12+ hours of use in on a single charge. Sound quality has been good, not very harsh in the way it amplifies and makes it easy to focus on voices and not flood you with background noise. Overall I have been very happy with these as finding something that fits well is extremely important for how good they will function. Sennheiser is a brand I have been familiar with and trust for quality, so far these hearing aids haven't disappointed yet. All in all I definitely recommend these hearing aids!"
118,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Work well for me,"I've needed hearing aids for quite a while.  I'm retired now and about half of my friends wear them.  Prescription hearing aids are very expensive.  I've resisted buying them because there are only some situations where I have problems, mostly parties and loud restaurants.  I'm reluctant to spend what a nice vacation costs just to find out if they work for me, especially since there isn't a way to try them out easily.  I normally get along pretty well.  Sometimes I have to ask people to repeat themselves, but I can watch TV, at least with my soundbar that has a setting for clear voice.  I've had professional hearing tests over the years and have been told I need hearing aids.  I've seen the audiogram as well, my hearing loss is real.The Sennheisers come across as truly professional.  Appearance wise they look the same as the prescription hearing aids my friends have.  They are quite inconspicuous, my wife didn't notice I was wearing them for several days.  The battery life is good, I typically wear them for 7 or 8 hours which runs the batteries down from full to about 45% or 50% so they should last through even a long day.  I wouldn't want hearing aids that aren't rechargeable.I was extremely impressed with the initial experience.  I charged them until the LED's turned green (about 2 hours).  They paired easily to the app (Samsung Galaxy), at least once I figured out that taking you have to take them out of the case to put them in pairing mode. They re-pair reliably whenever they aren't charging. The app is very simple, and has proved to be quite useful, although there are a few things I'd change.The most surprising thing was that they felt completely natural right away.  There hasn't been any squealing or feedback ever.  I've tried to trigger it with maximum gain and maximum EQ and they have never squealed. And they don't just make everything louder, there seems to be some processing that enhances intelligibility beyond just simple amplification.  Initially I wore them for my ordinary routine, watching TV, shopping etc.  They did improve TV sound intelligibility, and didn't get in the way or interfere with my normal routine.  I could hear lot of sounds I couldn't hear previously, especially high frequencies where I know I have the most hearing loss.  I probably won't wear them every day though, I get along pretty well and end up needing hearing protection rather than hearing aid when I'm in my workshop or using power tools, which I frequently do.The app is quite simple.  The main screen has a volume control that can be optionally split into Left and Right.  This is good for me since my left ear is much worse than my right.  This screen also shows the battery charge level for each hearing aid.  At the top there is a ""Sound Modes"" selector which allows only two modes, Automatic and Live music.  I would like to see more modes, especially a ""Party"" mode.  There is a button ""Fine Tune"" that opens up a 3 band equalizer and a toggle for ""Wind Noise Reduction"".The real test was dinner in a very loud restaurant with 5 other people.  While not perfect my ability to hear was much better than without the hearing aids, especially my left ear which is my bad ear.  I always split the volume control and have the left one or two steps higher than the right.  Watching TV or shopping the right is usually -2 and the Left -1, with the EQ flat.  In the loud restaurant I found that increasing the treble nearly to max, with the bass down and the mid up a bit made voices more clear.  I also had the volume nearly maxed out on the Left and a bit lower on the right.  They are directional, it helps a lot if I'm facing the person who is talking.There are some things I'd change if I could.The largest annoyance involves power on/off.  When the hearing aids are placed in the charger they disconnect from the phone.  But if the charger is unplugged they don't show as paired even though they are on.  The batteries will run down, so its necessary to turn them off manually each time unless they are actually charging.  It would be far better for them to detect the case regardless of charging mode.  The case is quite large given it doesn't have any real functionality other than holding the aids for charging.  I'd very much like it if it had its own battery, similar to most wireless ear buds.  This would make travel a lot easier and eliminate the on/off annoyance.Functionally I'd like it if the equalizer had another band, and if the left and right could be split like the volume.  I also like to save settings as a mode, for example the settings for the loud restaurant.Despite the things I'd change I still rate these as 5 stars because they work and work well.  I've tried two or three less expensive hearing amplifiers and OTC hearing aids that were completely useless.  The Sennheisers worked immediately and easily.  They definitely improve my hearing, especially in noisy rooms where I couldn't follow the conversation before.  Because of them I understand that hearing aids can work for me.  At some point I'll may want more but I'll know what I want and why.  It will be much easier to judge the value of spending more.  The Sennheisers would continue to be useful as a backup pair in that case.The Sennheisers aren't inexpensive but they are less than a quarter the price most if my friends have paid for their prescription hearing aids.  There may be less expensive OTC hearing aids that work OK, but the ones I've tried were terrible.  If my hearing loss gets worse I'll spend the money for the prescription hearing aids.  But I'm quite pleased with these for now."
118,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Decent sound, easy to use","These hearing aids took less than an hour to set up. You have to download an ap to your phone, then use it to set up the hearing aids. The ap is pretty simple and self-explanatory. There's an instruction booklet that you do have to read in order to be able to work all the features of the hearing aids and maintain them.These are the second set of OTC hearing aids I've tried. The first made things seem excessively scratchy and distorted, due to the way they handled high frequency sounds. For me, these Sennheisers took very little getting used to, and after a week or two all I noticed was that the sonic environment around me seemed richer and more interesting. My hearing loss is mostly in high frequencies, and I don't need much in terms of across-the-board amplification.Result? I can understand what people are saying better. I play bass in an orchestra, and from my spot in the back I was having difficulty understanding what the conductor was saying. That problem is mostly gone now. A few days ago I sat in a cafeteria with a couple of hundred high school students, and I had no difficulty understanding what my companion across the table was saying. Can I hear now with these hearing aids at 79 the way I did when I was 20? I don't think so, but this is a big step in the right direction.Cons: If you don't have a smartphone and aren't able to work slightly complicated ap's, these hearing aids are not for you. Returning to the ap after the initial setup I found a little confusing. The hearing aids have two tiny buttons, and you have to memorize what they do. Getting the buds into your ears and then getting the hearing aids in position behind your ears is a little awkward, but I guess this is the case with all hearing aids of this type. I have never tried the kind that just fit in your ear canal with nothing behind the ear. The 45-day free return period is shorter than some of the competition. These complaints are nothing that would reduce my 5-star rating.The bottom line is that these hearing aids work very nicely. I can't say what they would be like for other people with different kinds of hearing problems, but for me they are keepers."
118,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Easy to use/Works well,"On the slim model, the mics are in the in ear piece and work well.  You can dial up the bass, which adds alot to the enjoyment of blue-tooth music.  Also since I use eye glasses, the in-ear mics avoid the scratchy pickup from hair, etc when the mics are behind the ear on conventional hearing aids.  Battery works well and lasts all day for me.  Easy to set up, and adjust fine tuning of treble, mid-tone, and bass.  Connection to phone is solid. Phone app is simple and works well. Good value for the money for someone with mild hearing loss and looking for a likely OTC hearing aid."

17,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product at a great price,"I have waited several weeks before writing a review for MD Hearing Aid Volt. After several weeks, I have been extremely pleased with this product.  I have slight hearing loss in one ear and moderate loss in the other.  I had purchased a hearing amplifier before hearing aids became available over the counter.  From the moment I put the MD hearing aids on I realized what an amazing difference there was.  I was hearing things that I didn't even know that I was missing.  The hearing aids are well made and the controls are easy to master and provide a wide range of volume and programs for various situations. Also, the batteries are rechargeable and that is a real plus.  After experimenting with several different types of ear pieces I found one that works perfectly for me.  I have been really pleased with these hearing aids and highly recommend them.  Great over the counter hearing aid at a great price point.  I am hearing things better than I have in years."
17,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,It should easily be wearable in the ear with no noise.,Patient can’t listen anything properly because even after every possible adjustment aid is not up-to level we need
17,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Junk..,These are junk. I had a pair of MD hearing aids that failed and were $200 cheaper. I tried to by another pair but they were discontinued.  I bought these as replacements. These are horrible. They have feedback. You can't tune them to hear without getting constant ringing. They are junk. Don't waste your money like I did.
17,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Had to send them back,"Only had these for about a month before the left one stopped working unexpectedly. While they worked, they were decent hearing aids. Especially for the price. Since I’m going to the trouble to send them back, I’ve opted for a refund instead of replacement. I think this time I’ll pay a little more and get a hearing aid that has an app for my phone and some type of Bluetooth compatibility.To be fair, if these had continued to work, I would have been satisfied, but probably not impressed."
17,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Quality Aids,Just received my pair of volt adhering aids and they are absolutely wonderful. Great quality for a very fair price. It is so nice to hear all that I have been missing.
17,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,Design flaw does not work for everyone .,I dislike the fact they will not stay in my ears. They are of no value if they are not in my ears 100% of the time I’m wearing them.
17,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Lousy sound quality and weak batter,"This company should be ashamed of itself. If I worked for this company, I would quit. ......... The thing pooped out after 12 hours, and the sound quality was full of static.  The crooks said the regular price for the ""Volt"" was $2000 but they had it on sale for $400 ..........  Not only that, I sent it back after two days, and now the lousy company doesn't want to give me back my money.  Yeah, I bought it through Amazon, but the lousy company put a hold on returning my money.  --- DON'T TRUST THIS COMPANY"
17,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very good value.,Well made. Did the job. Very satisfied.
17,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,I have only tried one other. So I don't know much.,I am very old so everything is more difficult. Also born with nerve deafness and tiny canal on left side. MD hearing aids are $5000 less than the Big Box Store I tried in 2010. I can wear them all day and hear much better. MD has been very helpful with the very few problems I had. Mostly my fault too. You may spend more but you won't get more elsewhere.
17,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Might work for you,My husband lost one of his older generation MD Hearing Aids so we thought we'd try this.  It whistled a lot. I called customer service and they suggested I buy more tips to try.  The old one he still has does work and does not whistle.  Your experience may differ.

17,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Customer Service/ Warranty,"These are bad hearing aids, but the customer service is horrible. They have a 1 year warranty but of purchased thru Amazon or Walmart they won't stand behind the product. My personal opinion stay away from MDHearing Aid."
17,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,My Disappointment,I was so excited it was great until I tried to eat. The sound of my Jaws moving was loud and clear.
17,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,That they don't last very long,That I purchased these on 09/08/2023 the deadline was 12/07/2023 and on 12/24/2023 the left one does not work at all!  Not happy with this happening.
17,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,Battery life,I have bought MDHearing Aids 3 times. Very satisfied. These last (7 months) Volt rechargeable the batteries do not last a full day on an overnight recharge. Warranty is good enough if you will send them $98 to determine if the repair is covered. I’m done with this company!
17,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Only an amplifier,"Most with hearing deficiencies have frequencies that need more amplification than others.  I recommend having yourhearing tested at Costco for custom programmed hearing aids...about $1,500 with free regular servicing."
17,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,"High hopes not realized. Can you repeat that, louder?","I have used the MD hearing Volt, Series H for about on month. They so work. and the higher frequencies had returned somewhat.  However, two issues. One is the  ""tubes"" are rather rigid and that means their stiffness ends up with a pain in the ear. And the tubes tend to get plugged up. Fixing that means removing the tubes and reaming the out. Sort of a bother. Each time I detach the tubes they become less tight. Tube cleaning seems to be a 2X time/week. And replacement the tubes is a $50 deal. Larceny. On a dollar/gram they cost like gold. I suspect the stiffness is the result of old replacements. Hard plastic.  And customer service over the phone is non existent. Has the company shut down?? So, OK. but low price and short lifetime may go together. And not much customer service. Must be a lot. of customers repeating my experience."
17,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,Only lasted 5 months (two of them),"Bought a pair of the Volt V series (under $300 at the time), and one failed completely after 5 months. Fortunately, warranty replaced both with a pair of the H series. 5 months later one of those failed. I very much liked the MD hearing aids for form, fit, and function. But now they cost a little more and the very poor level of quality has me searching for my next pair. Good luck with your selection....UPDATE: MDHA is providing some above and beyond customer service. I sincerely hope I'm not back here in 5 months."
17,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Cheap made China product,Not worth $20 . Save your money . They act so nice until you want to return them for refund . Embarrassing return policy .
17,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,HEARING AMPLIFIERS NOT HEARING AIDS,After experiencing some hearing loss in my right ear I have been looking for a hearing aid to help with the problem.  I did not find this hearing aid easy to use. I found it difficult to adjust the controls once in place behind the ear and the noise produced by touching it once in place was annoying. I found that using it to improve my hearing only amplified the distortion in that ear and did not improve clarity substantially.  It has 4 settings besides volume but again I did not find switching between them easy with the small button on the hearing aid. They might work for someone else but did not work well for me.
17,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,VOLT OTC hearing aids,"If I had to rate the sound quality, it's mediocre. For the price I expected it to be higher. It didn't come with extra earbuds but it did come with a charging cord and a 5v1a adapter. There is a pamphlet that explains a stepping process to go thru. With hearing aids, finding the right ones is hit or miss. Because of the sound quality I have to give it 3 stars."
17,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,terrible sound quality...popping and static no matter how much i adjust,"nice box....nice storage case, nice charger and cord, good instructions for adjustments and volume....simply terrible sound quality and constant, annoying interference, popping and high pitches. If you touch them to adjust, they go off the charts with noise. They are comfortable in a old school conventional way, but they come with no ear bud cup choices so fit is mostly miss unless the ones on there are your size conveniently. The connection between the ear cup and the unit is very fragile and makes terrible noise when anything comes in contact with it. The adjustments on the unit are fine once you get used to the tiny size and what the controls feel like. Not impressed, even when it works, it is so bad that I want to take them out."
17,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,Poor experience and questionable claims,"I suffer from mild hearing loss and have been trying various OTC hearing aids ever since the regulations were relaxed last year. I was excited to try this brand because it has a professional-looking website and seemingly has reviews. Upon experiencing the product, I have to say I'm disappointed with the experience and it did not live up to my expectations. The hearing aids look very similar and in my experience perform no better than the much cheaper (<$100) hearing aids on Amazon. They did not offer any advanced features that I would expect for the premium I paid. One positive thing is that the instructions were clear and helpful, but I ultimately did not find that to be enough to make me recommend these."
17,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,They are working fine for me.,"These is good hearing aids. They work very well. They definitely help to enhance my hearing. Very easy to use and they look great. Hoping it will last, slightly concerned about the durability. Time will tell."
17,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Terrible,Got these for my deaf brother in law who lost his hearing aids. I knew these weren’t meant to be replacements for expensive medical grade aids but he said they didn’t help his hearing at all. Waste of money.
17,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth the money or the time to deal with them.,"I purchased the earlier model Volt and they lasted exactly 3 days before the right one would not charge. I cleaned the ports as instructed, and there was no way possible to get it to charge. I finally got MD hearing to replace them, and they replaced them with these as an upgrade. Well, guess what upon taking them out of the package, they will not charge either. It shows they are fully charged, but they will not even turn on. They are pure trash.DON’T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!!!"
17,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Broken within 8 months - there is no warranty if you buy from Amazon,"Terrible quality, terrible customer service, terrible warranty"
17,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wow,Ordered this for my mom who lost one of her hearing aids.Mom loves them. They fit well. The instruction manual is very thorough. And goes through everything with clear instructions and great color photos to illustrate to you how things need to look. The hearing devices are completely rechargeable and comes with not just the charging cord but the Plug in too. We both are very impressed with the product.Product comes with a case that is also your charging base. The left and right are clearly labeled.
19,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Better than BTE’s,"I have used behind-the-ear hearing aids for over 25 years. My hearing loss is “moderate to severe”, mostly caused by exposure to machinery and genetics. My complaint with BTE’s was that the sound was never natural. I have used Resound, phonac , Lively and Lucid brand BTE’s and could not understand speech from children or from the TV. These new Sony CIC’s have eliminated that problem. I have the volume set about mid scale and I can hear everything much more clearly than with any previous device. I think it is because the CIC design takes advantage of your outer ear shape to direct the sound to the device whereas the BTE design relies on their tiny microphones to capture the sound. I have the CRE-C10 model. I prefer the battery over the rechargeable because if they go dead I can immediately recover whereas with a rechargeable model I would need to wait several hours to recover. I highly recommend this product."
19,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fantastic!,"The media could not be loaded.
                



I got prescription level, top-of-the-line, and hearing aids a few years ago and I did not like them at all. And they were $2000.These are fantastic three sets of sleeve, depending on what kind of or size ear hole you have fit perfectly.  I’m 6 foot, 215 pounds in the small out of the box fit my ears perfectly..I keep saying perfectly a lot, but these are just amazing. I can hear good. I can adjust the volume you can’t even see their in my ear. I’ll post a picture of that. Go to a hockey game they turn himself down and go outside. They themselves stop playing the guitar they sound great. I use headphones with them music and no problem at all. Easy to take out easy to put in. I love the fact that the batteries so I can swap a battery out and the last three or four days up to two weeks depending how much use them.You might find a different experience, but for me, I’m blown away.We’re in the car, my wife sitting in the passenger seat and say, can you even see these things are my ears and she looked at me and said” see what, in your ears”There you go, enough saidBe very careful pulling off a sleev if you want to try the other sizes.  It’s easy to pull them apart/tear if you don’t get your finger nail under the metal end piece that snaps it onto the hearing aid."
19,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great concept but a lot of feedback,"These look and fit great, but they are not designed for moderate hearing loss. If you turn them up they have a lot of feedback."
19,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best hearing aids I’ve worn,"I have worn hearing aids for almost eight years.  I started with the top-end Widex, then went to Eargo 6s, and then back to Widex.  I purchased these Sony C-10s and I absolutely love them.  They are more comfortable than any others I’ve used and the sound is great.  It is easy to adjust the sound via the Sony Hearing app.  Although having rechargeable devices is more convenient, I went with these to avoid the inevitable battery fade of a small rechargeable device.  The batteries are small, but it’s easy to replace them if you pay attention to how they go in.And they are less than half the cost of the other two brands I’ve used.Give them a try.  I’m pretty sure you’ll love them."
19,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not for severe hearing loss,"I was excited to get these because they are small and I am annoyed with the over the ear amplifier, there’s an app that you have to register with email and password after giving them too much info then you have to take a hearing test one ear st a time answering a series of how many beeps did you hear 0-4 I could only hear few out of about 8 different times, I failed the test and tried again three more times, so I wasn’t able to get the point when I could actually hear anything with them in my ears, no option other than returning them very disappointed , they are very small and comfortable wish they would have worked for me"
19,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Work great in noisy situations.,"These hearing aids work great!  My old hearing aids weren’t good at picking out speech in noisy situations which led me to buy these Sony CRE-C10 as they seemed to meet my requirements, were a high end product from a company I trust, and not overly expensive. After the initial set-up and some fine tuning, I can hear conversations again!  And they are so comfortable that I don’t notice I have them on, until l take them off and wonder why everything is suddenly quiet. The  batteries are a little tricky to change but it gets easier with practice and they do last about 70 hours as advertised.  The only drawback is that they don’t have Bluetooth for streaming music etc but I have airpods for that when needed.  All in all a great product that I can heartily recommend to anyone with similar hearing issues."
19,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good quality,"I have limited experience with hearing aids other than handling my parents for comparison. For the money, these are high quality and did assist my ability to converse easier in public. If you are sensitive about being seen with them in, these go a long way in helping ease your anxiety.  I wore them around the house for the first two days and my wife and three kids never once noticed them.I am in the process of returning as I have small ear canals and they were very uncomfortable for short periods of time even with the XS attachments. If I could have found a way to make them fit comfortably, I would have kept them.If you are on the fence about dropping 3-6k on hearing aids, I would try these and definitely recommend."
19,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect choice for senors,"After owning top of the line hearing aids ($5200.00) that where starting to have problems I decided to try these less expensive ones. I had checked out quite a few and decided on the Sony invisible ones. They turn out to be as good as my old ones. It took me a good week to get them adjusted to my needs, but with patience they are exactly the right ones for me."
19,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,I almost cried when I first started using them.,I lost a lot of hearing from the mumps when I was 5 years old. Now I am 62 and this is the best I have been able to hear my entire life. My wife was outside talking to the neighbor and I could here her. I am truly amazed! Thank you all!
19,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sony hearing aids work,"I suffered sudden hear loss on Easter, an aerosol can exploded in my bathroom, resulting on losing 40% of my hearing in both ears. I saw 2 ENT Dr's and an Audiologists. They reccomend hearing aids.  I then went to my local Costco , which I highly reccomend, if purchaseing RX hearing aids, you save thousand of $.The Costco I want to let me Demo very similar hearing aids to the Sony's for a week.  They were Rexton's , which are also made by the Sony , and Signer mfg.They are the same product essential, but different levels of technology.  The costco Rexton were $2200, used the exact same app as Sony' s. Just with a different app name.  The biggest difference was the Rexton units had 1 more preprogrammed app, setting that was "" restaurant mode"" which would turn down background noice in loud settings. While that was very helpful, and I do miss it, these are essential the same units as they Rexton. & Signer brand hearing aids.They just have some features turned off.  They definitely work.  I'm happy with them.for the price.  I reccomend watching youtube Dr Cliff to help setup.  He reccomends over boosting loudness control over Sony's reccomend setting, it help me get the most power from the units."
19,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Better than Eargo in many ways,"It took a while to get used to my Eargo hearing aids, and I had to remove the bottom petal from the mic cap so they'd fit without hurting my ears. I loved being able to adjust the sound level to the environment by flicking the pull string, and the small size. But after a year or so, they just wouldn't hold a charge, often failing when I needed them most. So I had to decide whether to spend $500 on a new battery charger or invest in new hearing aids. I'm glad I decided to purchase Sony CRE-C10s instead of a charger.Overall, the sound is as good as my Eargos, and the click sleeves are so comfortable that I often forget I'm wearing hearing aids. The batteries last multiple days and are relatively easy to replace. (Use the yellow tab on the battery to position it in the aid, then remove the tab.) I wish I could turn them Off without opening the battery door, but I can live with it. I have the sound set to the highest level, and the balance set to max treble, because my hearing loss is in the upper register.The biggest problem I've encountered is occlusion. Because my hearing is better in my right ear, I'm using a Left aid only. With both inserted I sound (to myself) like I'm talking from the bottom of a barrel. I'm using extra small Connexx sleeves right now; I'm going to try sizing up to Small to see if they'll work better.Also, the sleeves make my ears sweat when I'm outside in the heat. I have to remove the aid, wipe the oil/sweat from both the aid and my ear canal, and then reinsert them. I didn't have that problem with Eargos, likely because they had open petal caps."
19,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound!,"I love the fit & feel of these in-ear aids, better than the larger out of ear ones.  Also, the sound is clear, & I can slide between an increase of treble or bass.  I wish [thus the 4 stars] there was a manual background noise control, or better noise reduction in total."
19,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,I expected more of Sony,"I really wanted this hearing aid to work. I have tried two other over-the-counter alternatives and they were absolutely disappointing. So when I tried Sony's hearing aid I had high hopes for a good product (not only for the long-standing electronics brand, but also considering they are pricey). Right off the bat, the sound was much better than the cheaper devices, so it got me excited. However, one of the sets was sounding funny, with some distortion. I called customer service (which was excellent, by the way) but this was never resolved. Also, the device is shaped like a smooth wedge. As I move my jaw, for eating and talking, it gets expelled out. So much for an aid meant to improve my hearing in restaurants and meetings. In the end, I am returning it and will keep looking."
19,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sony CRE-C10 Self-Fitting OTC Hearing Aids are amazing!,"Sony CRE-C10 Self-Fitting OTC Hearing Aids are amazing! These Sony hearing aids replaced my Starkey Invisible In Canal Hearing Aids that I have had for years.I originally was fitted with Starkey's custom made invisible in the canal hearing aids in 2014. They were just about $7,000 for that first pair.In 2019, I had to replace them because I had broken one of them and warranty had ran out. The next set was a little cheaper at $5,700. Both sets took molds of my ear canals to give me a ""perfect fit"". Wearing hearing aids changed my life and I was very happy with the improvement they provided.Unfortunately; the perfect fit from the custom made in my ear made me constantly feel like I was under water or in a plane. I had to constantly clear my ear pressure by plugging nose and blowing hard. I had constant adjustments with audiologist and I was never perfectly satisfied with the units. The uncomfortable feeling of the custom made units just made me stop wearing them about 2 years ago. It was Covid-19 time and I just didn't want to wear them around the house.When the FDA approved over the counter hearing aids; I was skeptical.  I watched many ads on TV and social media for other products and I was not convinced OTC would work. Then the Sony CRE-C10 Self-Fitting OTC Hearing Aid showed up in my social media feed. I did some research and they looked very similar to my Starkey units. Difference was there was an adjustable vented sleeve that was over the unit. Basically like an earbud with multiple sizes. I decided to try them.They were less than $1,000 and came with an assortment of sized vented sleeves. I took them out of the box and followed the app instructions. Within about 30 minutes; I had them up and running and adjusting the volume and control on my units. They are way more comfortable than the custom made Starkey units since the vented sleeve forms to your ear and leave an air opening in the canal. Gone are the feelings of my ears being plugged up like on a plane.After using about 2 weeks; I have done just a few adjustments and they are superstars. My ear size for the vented sleeve is size Small and that was what was installed on the units when they arrived. So basically; unboxed, downloaded the app, paired and put them in ears - Voila they worked. It was super easy and I love them.I rarely write reviews and hope that this one helps!"
19,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,You Will Forget You’re Wearing Them!,"These OTC hearing aids are very small and discreet. I chose these because I have a pair of prescription RIC aids that get in the way while wearing glasses, removing T’s, and Pullovers. The Sony Cre-C10’s also did not catch the wind when bike riding. I have small ear canals and didn’t find them uncomfortable as some have said. I removed a star because a simple blue and red dot would have been a quick solution to finding the right or left bud. I found I had to reach for glasses because the tiny R&L are hard to distinguish in low lighting. Unfortunately as I age my hearing has diminished substantially in 1 ear. I now have a severe loss which these aids cannot compensate for. I wore them for 3 weeks and returned them for a full no hassle refund.In summary: I was amazed that these aids worked so well. If not for the 1 bad ear I would’ve loved to have kept them."
19,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Noticeable Improvement - Wife Approved,"My wife really notices my ability to hear her and demands I wear these.  These fit completely in the ear canal, so are virtually invisible.  The right size ear cup makes a huge difference in comfort.  The XS work best for me.  I've tried (and returned)  some cheaper aids, but they amplified the noise as much as what I wanted to hear.  These work a lot better.  Some noise is still amplified, but if the setup is done correctly, it isn't bad.  I've noticed a big improvement in hearing the TV, hearing conversations in public, and improved hearing in crowded situations.  The app leaves a lot to be desired but gives some basic control.  I wish there were some preset configurations to quickly set up the aids for different situations (crowds vs. outdoors vs. in the house).  If I want to use earbuds, I have to take these out but hasn't been too big of a deal.  The aids are really small, so I've had to be careful to have the case handy, or I might lose one when I'm using earbuds.  These aren't perfect but look like keepers."
19,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,good option,"UPDATED June 2024Left hearing aid died.Called Sony support (chat operator)Pleasantly surprised!!!Interacted with 3 different persons as needed to try their instructions.All of them very helpful and patient.Eventually was confirmed the unit was non-responsive and a replacement was offered.Received a full set (both ears) brand new, they work very well.Had trouble with the app installed in my IPhone, eventually support guided me to a set-up of the software.Unit was purchased last September, glad was still within the 1-year warranty.My 4 stars remain as these are good options but not there yet on human voice recognition.5 Stars on support and service.Have used the Costco hearing aids for 2 years, decided to try these, and they are definitively an improvementnoise magnified is a little better, speech remains a problem, these aids do not provide to differentiate spoken words, it fares better but not there yet.Will keep them and hope technology continues to improve and as research/production delivers a better product in a not too distant future.Unfortunately, purchased them before the 100 dollars discount!!  bummer!"
19,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent investment. I’m a happy customer!👍🏻,"Over the past 5 years I’ve tried a bunch of $100-300 hearing aids, basically results were underwhelming. I spent $2600 on Eargo 6’s and was pleased until after 12 months the rechargeable battery failed and I found Eargo doesn’t do a replacement. $2600 per year is ridiculous imho.Because of my prior disappointment I wanted to wait a few weeks before posting a review.My experience is that the Sony's are at least equal in performance to the Eargo's at about 1/3 of the cost. Batteries are easy to replace and about $50/year, very reasonable. The Sony CRE-C10 APP is helpful to adjust tone and volume. The feature providing current level of charge is very helpful.After nearly a month of constant usage I recommend these units very highly."
19,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Very good.,"I tried a couple of other ones. Set up was simple, follow the bouncing ball. These work very well, and are tiny. The most important thing is that since they are so small you use your ears and get a 3D perception of sound so sounds are directional. The other ones were too big and you lose that, it can make you dizzy.So five stars for sound quality and comfort.They are too small for rechargeable batteries, which is a bummer. Batteries last like two days.And they ain't cheap. But some of these things can get quite expensive...All in all it's Sony quality. So do I recommend them?Yes."
19,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Better instructions would help,"This was a first experience with in the ear OTC hearing aides. Published reviews compared them favorably with more expensive products, and they seem effective.  The instructions for setting them up could be better. For example, the adjustment for tonal balance shows a slider with treble at the top and bass at the bottom. It is unclear exactly what is being changed, but it is most likely just the higher frequency output. The Sony app itself easy to use for the most part. There is almost no instruction regarding how to select the best fit for the rubber suspension caps that snap on to the devices to hold them in place and minimize extraneous sounds. The is clearly a tradeoff between reliability and comfort. There are 4 sizes, and while one of the smaller sizes felt better, we did have one of the hearing aids fall out while using it. Some discussion of how much adaptation takes place over time so that the devices do not feel uncomfortable in the ear might be helpful.Overall, these are cost effective compared with similar products, and Sony is likely to be around long term while some of the companies making competing devices may not."
19,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Better than my $5000 pair.,"Hands down these are better in every way than my ME RIC 312 that cost $5000.00. Zero wind noise, sound quality is great and the self fitting is equally impressive. No more scratching sounds is a bonus as well. Highly recommend the CRE C10s."
19,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound quality, have to get use to something in your ear.",Great sound quality.  Wish they blue toothed to my phone but for the price you can't beat it.
19,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing. I love them.,"I have tried many hearing aids over the years, and these are by far the best. If you have tried Signia as I have, you will quickly learn that they are made in collaboration with that company, which charges many times the price of these.  And these are better than my Signias! Set up is simple, and better the results are better than multiple trips to the audiologist.  Highly Recommended!"
19,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It is a great device, for many a better option","Fit was great, no need to pay extra for custom fit. But unfortunately my hearing requirements exceded the current OTC possibilities, thanks to the great service of the vendor I returned it to them at full refund. Dont miss test it"
19,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice,"These hearing aids sound better than my $3000 hearing aids that I had to constantly have adjusted.I can wear them all day with no discomfort and don’t even know they are in my ears. I have only had them three days now however with the Sony name I trust that they will be durable and problem free. Time ,of course will tell.The setup and app controlled hearing test is simple, easy and seems accurate and sounds are crisp and clear. I put them in a dry case each night to eliminate any accumulated moisture from each days wearing to extend their life."
19,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Trouble with Service Department,"These hearing aids are Great!! But the left hearing aid battery holder Broke. Dealing with the Service Department was to much Red Tape , Protocol to much ! Felt I was a on the Defense !! I just wanted my left hearing aid!"
19,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not for me,They didn’t work for me it was either all background noise or no sound couldn’t find a setting to help my hearing without having a lot of background noise and my own voice sounded like a robot.
19,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Better than any OTC or prescription hearing aid I’ve had!,"Received same day, easy setup using phone and following instructions, sounds it tailored better than the audiologist did on my last hearing aids. I have had Eargo Neo Hifi’s, Eargo 7 and oticon in ear hearing aids and these beat them all! I’m one day in but completely impressed with the sound quality and being able to hear TV and my wife! She’s happy about that too!"
19,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great little aids,After a few months I am very happy with these aids. Setup was easy. Small enough that they go unnoticed. I have the 5 thousand dollar aids but really do prefer these.
19,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,I wish I would’ve found this product a year ago,"In the last year, I purchased 5 to 6 different hearing assistant products via Amazon.On the surface, they all did what one could expect, given the price point.Once I splurged, and bought this set, I never looked back.In the purchases leading up to this purchase I spent way more than I did on the Sony product. It’s versatility and ease of operation via the app make it my new favorite."
19,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,*READ THIS ✔️*!!! My hubby’s affordable dream come true is here 🙌! Thank you Sony!!!,"Yes, there are cheaper options out there for over the counter use, BUT if you are looking for quality, effectiveness & value, as you still cannot buy a real set of professional grade hearing aids at anywhere close to the cost of these, then you NEED these Sony hearing aids in your life. FDA registered & the best model that we have tried to date!We cannot afford to get my husband the ‘real’ hearing aids he so desperately needs. Times get hard, and when they do? Reach out to SONY! A name that you can trust 🙌. For the just under $1,000 price point, they truly are a winner at a fair price to both the person who needs them & the people that are around them, whose lives that their altered hearing ability, also does affect. This I know quite well.These fit in the ear discreetly, are comfortable & stay inside the ear canal better than most. They truly DO help with even the higher end of moderate, hearing loss, as one of my husband’s ears is a decent bit worse than the other one. Typical hearing amplifiers in the $150-$350 price range, they offer only very minimum help.. some not at all for him. These are a game changer.The Sony name is a plus. Their ability to help change lives of those on a budget? That is the game changer! They hold a charge like a boss & really ARE worth the money, from an honest reviewer to the general public. This product IS worth giving a go at. When you can’t afford the rest… then Sony is the best! If they happen to NOT be everything you’re looking for, Amazon’s return policy is top notch. Buy & try with confidence 👍!An impossibly rare for us, full 5 star rating for a hearing device based on quality for cost- functionality- true blue effectiveness- discretion- aesthetics ✔️! 10/10 recommendation! Great product, phenomenal gift 🎁!!⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️** I hope my review has been helpful 😊!**"
19,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,hearing aids,"I really wanted to love these. unfortunately for the price I do not see these being worth it.  They came up with a good plan for hearing aids, I mean the app has you do a hearing test with each ones before you start to use them, but once the hearing test was done, I always felt like they weren't even on when they were.  It did not enhance the sounds around me at all.  I wanted to use these when I am watching TV or a movie but no change when they are in my ears.  I also tried each different size ear piece and none were comfortable.  At first I put them away then I said maybe it was just me, so I reset them and tried all over again, but unfortunately I ended up with the same results.  They do not work for me."
19,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Not quite as good as traditional hearing aids, but a great deal","I got hearing aids last year for the first time. I went to a local audiologist (because Costco didn’t have appointments for months; my local health system didn’t even call me back). The audiologist was wonderful, and extremely patient; she helped me try several different kinds of hearing aids, including the custom-molded Oticons I finally decided on. My audiologist really earned her money, but the final bill was $7000 (some of that’s due to my living in the San Francisco Bay Area). Even so, I settled. None of the hearing aids I tried really solved my hearing issues, but I had tried all of the options.So now, given the opportunity to try over-the-counter hearing aids (via the Vine program), I decided to give them a shot. In short, they don’t have the fine-tuned audio curves that my audiologist created, but they do help in some situations, and at a fraction of the price, I think they’re a fantastic option for people who either don’t have the money for traditional hearing aids or are just dipping their feet into the idea. And as this is really just the first round of OTC hearing aids, they’re going to get better—and I hope they push traditional hearing aid makers to greatly improve their products and become more price-competitive.The CRE-C10 hearing aids I’m using are much smaller than my custom-molded in-the-canal Oticons, and they’re much more comfortable. The Sonys are *really* comfortable. Traditional hearing aids come in many different types and sizes, with the behind-the-ear kinds having the most features (like two microphones, for better directional hearing). The CRE-C10s are the size of the smallest “completely in the canal” (CIC) type, meaning that most people won’t be able to see them when you’re wearing them, even if your hair doesn’t cover your ears. They amplify sound, of course, but they also don’t block unamplified sound as much as the Oticons I use. This makes them much more comfortable aurally; I don’t get the sensation that my ears are plugged.The downside to the CRE-C10s’ size is that, as with most (all?) CIC hearing aids, they don’t have Bluetooth. You can make some minimal settings via a phone app, but you can’t tell how much battery life is left, and you can make only very basic changes to the audio qualities. You turn them on or off by closing or opening the battery door (as with most hearing aids).The phone app gives you a “volume” control and a “sound balance” control, the latter of which means only bass versus treble. It has a “fine tuning” mode, but you have to log in to it every time, and it’s more like you’re setting up the hearing aids for the first time again; you’re not making instantaneous changes. You answer questions, like, “Speech: incomprehensible, too soft, sharp, too loud,” which might be helpful, except that they’re too basic. One problem with hearing aids is, for example, you’re in a restaurant, and you want to hear the people sitting at your table, but the people three tables down are laughing and shouting. Some hearing aids—ones with multiple microphones—purport to help with situations like this (though they really don’t). But questions like the Sony app poses don’t even try to address the problems that many of us experience.And most of the times that you want to adjust your hearing aids’ settings is in challenging situations, and that’s not when I want to walk through the setup again. The Oticons (and most other hearing aids) allow you to adjust on the fly, access pre-programmed situational profiles (like “Restaurant” or “Theater”), and they let you set up and save profiles that work for you; the Sony app does not. The app does very little after your initial setup, and it is pretty frustrating to use. Most of the time, if adjusting the volume or trying the bass versus treble control doesn’t help, I give up.So, do the CRE-C10s work? For me, the audio quality across the board isn’t as good as my Oticons, and the app is far, far worse. But they work just as well in some situations. For example, amplifying the speech of my low-talking teenager in a quiet room is just as good. And, the CRE-C10s are much more comfortable. In challenging situations, neither is going to help, though.If the CRE-C10s had been available before I went to the audiologist, I probably would have been just as happy with them as the Oticons, because I’m not all that happy with the Oticons, and I’m not all that happy with the Sonys, so why not be not that happy at a fraction of the price? Just keep in mind that, while you’re not paying for the services of an audiologist, you’re not getting them, either, and for many people, those services are worth paying for."
19,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great hearing aids,I enjoy this product very much it is high quality and helps a lot with my hearing a recommend this product to any age person
19,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Fit is a difficult thing,"I have weird ear canals. Not many ear buds fit me well. These are not made to order so fit is similar. They are mad for the average ear canal. I cannot get a good fit with these. I therefor can't use them. I didn't reduce too many stars, since I have had this experience with a slew of ear buds. Build quality is nice. This is a quality product, but just keep in mind these are not fitted and fit is key to a good experience."
19,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great! Amazing for the price!,"Almost two weeks have passed since my CRE-C10 aids arrived, and I could not be happier. They're not uncomfortable at all, and I can hear! I am 68 and worked in a boisterous environment during my state trooper firearms instructor and siren above-my-head career. The sounds I have not perceived in years are clear to me now…the turn indicator makes a blinking sound, the toaster dings when done, and my slippers are noisy on linoleum floors. Ha. I have not had to utter HUH very much at all lately …had to ask my wife not to talk to me so loud, and I can hear and UNDERSTAND the dialogue on TV without closed captions. I found that smaller ear bits are more comfortable and efficient than larger ones.I purchased a dehumidifier gadget for these babies as I will take genuine good care of them, and apparently, moisture is a demon to them eventually. At night before bed, in the dehumidifier, they go. I learned that the batteries last pretty long if I leave the battery doors open when I take them out for the night. The other evening, a pleasant female voice said Low Battery in my ear, keeping me from prematurely replacing batteries. I bought a pack of 48 quality batteries for less than $20. I put one of the more miniature packs in the car in case I'm out and get a low battery warning. It is essential to leave the battery door open with a fresh battery for 5 minutes before closing and using the aids to increase battery life substantially. The iPhone app is excellent and easy to use…sometimes they might not connect, but simply recycling the Bluetooth on the phone sorts that issue out. I only need the app if there is a significant sound environment change. I was in an auditorium last night for a eulogy and could easily hear and understand the speakers rather than just a loud background sound around me. I was surprised to learn that I must add some bass in the sound adjustment to keep things from sounding tinny. Bass has been my enemy for a while but no more. I wish I had been able to use these for the past ten years, as I have missed a lot in conversation and surroundings. I am impressed with the quality and support. After all, they're Sony! Color me ecstatic."
19,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Exceptional control via app and excellent hearing,"So far exceptionally pleased with these - this is after trying a number of other hearing aids which were either ineffective or based on different locations and sound levels would lose a lot of its effectiveness.So here are the amazing positives:1.  Incredibly small - these are invisible to people around you - someone would have to know that you are wearing the pair and would have to look closely to see any trace of the hearing aids.2.  Very comfortable - three sizes of earbuds (click buds) - once inserted they are like very comfortable headphones - easy to pull out as they have specialized attachments to grab and pull out the hearing aid.3.  The battery installation is effortless and can be done within a second - to turn off the battery compartment just has to be opened to conserve battery life (no. 10 battery).4.  The installation of the app and the adjustments, paring of the earbuds with the app, and setting the personalized controls are very easy.  The setup and adjustment take about 20 minutes for each ear and specific to each.5.  Once installed and tailored to you - you can use the app to make some adjustments to the volume, treble and bass for different environments.Excellent hearing aid so far.  Very pleased with the improvement in hearing for an OTC hearing aid since the change in the rules allowing OTC - as always, this is great piece of electronics by Sony - stylish and works very well."
19,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great alternative to conventional hearing aids,"These are great hearing aids, and work even better than I expected considering the Sony brand. These are the CRE-C10 (replaceable battery) model, which I find significantly less convenient than a rechargeable battery, but it lasts days without needing a replacement. The other nice thing about replaceable batteries is you can immediately swap out the batteries if it dies (whereas the rechargeable model takes several hours to use again).These are really small and fit comfortably in my ears. I get no noticeable ear fatigue even after wearing these for 6+ hours. They are virtually invisible.Unlike other hearing aids, these do not squeal or screech at me and rarely require readjusting in my ears. This alone is a huge plus for me. The sound quality is also excellent and I really can't distinguish it from regular sound. It doesn't sound distorted, it just makes everything sound louder in a clean and clear way.Overall - these are really a game changer for me. They are far better than any other hearing aids I've tried and the sound quality is better than even my prescription aids (which admittedly are getting to be pretty old).  If you are looking for an OTC hearing aid option, this is a great choice, although I personally prefer the rechargeable model."
19,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Tiny and Effective,"I've tried a number of over-the-counter hearing aids and this is the first one I've tried is isn't more than a glorified earbuds.They are tiny. While they are black and you can see them, they do fit deep in the ear canal and pretty much disappear when you are wearing them. I would prefer if they were white or a more neutral color.The sound is fantastic. They amplify the sound around you in a comfortable way that isn't annoying or distracting.I do wish they had a rechargeable battery as replacing the battery is annoying and there is a little anxiety that it might run out when you don't have batteries handy but the 70 hour life is good for about a week of use.They are not Bluetooth compatible so they are purely hearing aids.Overall happy with the ""Sony CRE-C10 Self-Fitting OTC Hearing Aid for Mild to Moderate Hearing Loss, Black""."
19,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent product for people with mild hearing loss!,"Both my husband and I have some mild hearing loss.  I have a set of lower quality in-ear hearing amplifiers which can only be adjusted for volume, but are helpful, and my husband expressed an interest in these, so I ordered them.  He set them up with ease on his Android phone, praised them, had no issues he would tell me about, but wouldn't wear them.  Since he wasn't using them, and I could use better quality hearing aids than what I had, I asked him if I could have these back.I had issues setting them up, as the instructions in the iOS app were not all appropriate (for instance, Bluetooth needs to be off, not on, during setup), and, as it turns out, also because he still had the app on his phone, so the hearing aids were attempting to pair to that phone, rather than mine.  I was able to figure that part out while I was on the phone with Sony's excellent support staff, but they not only stayed on the line, but also called me back when I lost the call a couple of times, and it turned out there was more, some of which needed to be bumped up to a higher level support staff member, which the first person did without my having to ask for him to do so.  I was still having some problems because the right one (in my better ear) was having an intermittent connection issue during setup (only).  Sony's higher level support person was able to suss out that it was caused by interference from my Apple Watch.  Once that was turned off, the hearing aid worked properly, and the app was able to complete the setup.  After setup, I was able to turn bluetooth back on on my phone and to turn the watch back on without issues.I love that these OTC hearing aids are individually tuned for my ears, as my hearing losses are not the same in each ear, and I'm now getting balanced hearing again, in addition to much better acuity.  It's amazing that my husband's mumbling is easier to hear too;-)  The app gives me the ability to increase or decrease volume from the mid level which it sets to when the battery door is closed again and the hearing aid put back in my ear at the beginning of the day.  (Open the battery door when you take them out at night, so the battery isn't draining.)  It also allows me to adjust for treble and bass, as needed to make it easier to hear human voices vs. other sounds.My husband's ""issue"", aside from his thinking he ""didn't really need"" hearing aids, seems to be that he listens to music and his computer a lot using earbuds, and thought that removing one set to use the other, swapping out numerous times during the day was inconvenient.  I, OTOH, mostly just use one earbud at a time to listen to the spoken word on audio books, and am happy for that to be in my right ear, so I can keep the hearing aid in the ear in which I have the more noticeable loss, even if I'm swapping the one in the right ear in and out occasionally.The only issues I have found is the size of the case, which is designed for carrying and/or storing the hearing aids themselves, but not large enough to hold the cleaning device or cloth, let alone a pack of spare batteries, and hearing aid batteries do get drained quickly.  Detailed information on how to clean the hearing aids would also be useful.  Additionally, one of the click sleeves, in a size neither of us needed, tore while it was being removed from the hearing aid initially, although the directions were being followed, and I have not found any information on how to order more, as I will want to keep spares on hand.  I should have asked customer service, and will have to call during their M-F daytime hours.Thank you for reading my review.  I hope you found it helpful."
19,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not nearly as good as a professionally programmed ones,"I’ve had hearing issues in my left year since I was 18 years old (over 20 years ago now). I’ve had multiple surgeries on that ear and after the last one I was left with tinnitus and even more hearing loss than before. I was able to get a hearing aid about 7 years ago and since my hearing loss is not typical (loss in the lower ranges, typical is higher ranges) I’ve gone to the audiologist a lot to make adjustments to what I have now. I currently use a custom molded Phonak Vitro M90 ITE (In-The-Ear) style hearing aid from 2021.I have an incredibly small ear canal on my left ear (from the surgieries) and I’ve always found the in-ear earphones and ear plugs to be uncomfortable after awhile. I actually looked at a pair of ITC (in-the-canal) style hearing aid (that is what these Sony’s are) but because of the size of my canal I decided against it since there is little customization options, other than smaller silicon sleeves. When I saw these come up on vine I decided I would test them out and see how they compare to my “premium” (aka expensive) hearing aid.I knew I’d need the smallest sleeve on my left ear so I immediately changed that out to the XS one (and I ripped the S one that was on there trying to get it off so be careful when removing them! I left the S on my right sided one. The left one almost fit in, if it was a little shorter it probably would have been fine. The right slid in perfectly.I don’t have any hearing loss in my right ear and I really don’t need it but I wasn’t given the option to not set it up. I went through the setup which is very similar to an actual hearing test, but it’s not done in a soundproof room, unless you’ve got one of those hanging around. Interestingly it did not come back with any warning about my left ear having issues. After doing both ears you get to adjust the volume independently from each side, I had to move my left ear up to 8 and my right ear down a couple levels so it sounded equal.When you’re all done with the setup you get two options to adjust, overall volume for both sides together and an option to increase bass or terrible. That’s it. I get a little bit more than that with my Phonak app with my hearing aid, but I was expecting to be able to actually program the Sony’s more like what an Audiologist can do. Really disappointing that I couldn’t actually find tune these, which for me is a deal breaker. I also couldn’t stand the feel of the silicone sleeves in my ear canals.Is my review biased? I’m not sure, I definitely don’t have typical hearing loss and mine is one sided. Would these be a good solution if I couldn’t get my health insurance to pay for hearing aids? Yes, for sure. I would totally make these work if I wasn’t able to get my custom hearing aid. I will be bringing these to my elderly parents to try. Neither of them have had hearing aids before (and they both need them) so I’ll be interested to see what their impressions are of them. But I see these more like “hearing amplifiers” than true hearing aids programmed by an audiologist. Now if you could have an audiologist program these for you, that would be a game changer.For reference my single hearing aid, before health insurance, was $3,000. If you needed two it would be $6,000. I did opt for the “premium” version but I could have gotten one for $1,000. So the the price of the Sony’s for less than $1,000 for two they could be worth a shot."
19,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,Wasted money,"I bought these because I have bilateral hearing loss, one side worse than other. Sony usually makes quality stuff, but these are not good if you have moderate to moderately severe. They did not help at all, just made your ears feel stuffy and your own voice boomed in your head. Thank God for returns. I was blessed enough to buy a better quality one that's wonderful....I hope these work for you."
19,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Good when they work,"I didn't buy these from Amazon, I bought them directly from Sony's website in Feb. 2023. I also bought Sony's 3-year protection plan at that time. since then, I am on my 4th set of replacement hearing aids. These are easy to set up on your smartphone, the sound is good, I actually prefer them to my $6,000 Oticons. However the durability just isn't there. I have received 2 replacement sets of the originals so far, but with each replacement Sony makes it harder and harder. The first set was easy, I did an online chat with a Sony rep and they replaced them. The second set a few months later was more of a hassle, more hoops to jump through. Now they're not working again, but Sony has outsourced the protection plan to a 3rd party, and they are unresponsive. I have been trying to get a repair or replacement now for about 10 days, for a right hearing aid that no longer works, but they are not responding to my requests. Which makes me think that Sony is having severe durability problems with this product. I notice that Amazon's protection plan for this product is through Asurian, and they may offer a better experience, but who has the time to hassle with these people when the hearing aids don't work. You definitely need to think twice and three times before buying this product.ADDENDUM 06/21/2024I've been trying to get a warranty replacement on these since May 31 and they are just giving me the run around. It is now 21 days without any hearing aids. I've done online chat with Sony but they are powerless because the protection plan is handled by a third party. CAVEAT EMPTOR!"
19,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,$4000 cheaper than my last ones,"I paid over 5k for my first set of hearing aids from Phonak. I had issues with them the entire time from having a continuous ""blocked"" feeling in both ears too not being able to hear music very well or play guitar without losing the ability to hear tones completely. Then after a while they started to malfunction and need to be sent away for fixing. Another $300 a pop each time that happened. Needless to say when the hearing aid market got deregulated I waited with anticipation.I first purchased the larger Sony larger ones with bluetooth but the large speaker part I found to be quite uncomfortable and make my ears hurt. I gave up on them after a couple of weeks. Sony took them back no questions asked and I then tried these little beauties. Yes I'm back to small batteries but the difference in feeling in my ears is unbelievable. I no longer have a ""blocked"" feeling in either ear and I can hear music and the guitar clearly again which for me is quite miraculous. I have no doubt they will continue to develop this type of aid as technology continually improves but at 1/5 th of the cost of custom hearing aids I'm okay with trying new ones out as they arrive on the market.Very satisfied overall. I would love a bit more control over them with the app and hope that Sony are able to develop that side of it. Of course recharging and bluetooth would be great too but I get the limitations at the moment. If you are done with paying exorbitant money for custom hearing aids, give these a go. I reckon you might just love them like I do!"
19,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome if you can get it to work,"I bought this for my 75 year old dad.  He isnt tech savvy so I had to set it up for him.  Setting up this hearing aid was disastrous.  I had to reset my fathers iphone xr even when it was updated to latest ios.  The installation had lots of bug.  once i was able to finally create sony account another problem came up.  Sony hearing center, ios app that controls the device was horrible.  My father and I did some 6 or 7 15 minute hearing test before we were able to bypass its “see a doctor” statement.  My father has hearing loss.  He already saw a doctor and has a hearing aid.  We got this hearing aid for convenience.  We dont need to be told to see a doctor and have software shut down installation.  After several hours of struggling to get the hearing aid working, I was able to finally get it to work.  Once working, my father told me this hearing aid worked better than his custom hearing aids.  I was also able to notice ease of communicating with my dad.  This is the reason I gave 4 star.  I would have given 5 stars if the installation didnt take so much work as it is impressive a 1000 dollar hearing aid can out perform ones that cost more."
19,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,I can’t believe my own ears!,"I dropped six grand on Signia Active X Pros and I had to constantly go on the app to adjust for the ambient noise, plus they wouldn’t stay in my ears and my dog ate one!Rather than replace that ONE hearing aid for three grand, I did a deep dive into the various options and found out that these Sonys are manufactured by the same company that makes Signias. In fact these Sony CRE-C10s have the exact same shell as the Signia Silks.So I got the Sonys to try. OMG, I’ve tested these in various sound environments and these things adjust automatically. No more reaching for my phone to adjust the hearing aids! This is the first review on Amazin I ever wrote because I wanna thank Sony for saving me big bucks and they just work, how you gonna beat that? Lol"
19,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,"More like hearing amplifiers, but they do help me somewhat","First of all, I have zero experience with hearing aids, but I am certain I need them, so I was excited to be able to try and review these from Sony.They are fairly comfortable in my ears and I have small ear canals.  I did need to use the smallest of the included tips.  Once they are in my ears they are very difficult for others to see, so no worries about people knowing you are wearing hearing aids, unless you want to tell them.I tried these in a busy restaurant while having dinner with friends, where I most often struggle to hear all parts of a conversation.  These did help, but they also picked up and amplified the sound of the large exhaust fans in the kitchen area, which we were admittedly close to.I also used these hearing aids when working at my booth at a local farmers market (outdoors.) I was able to hear customers more clearly while wearing these, so that is a win in my book.  If there also happens to be music or other loud background noise I still struggle to hear conversations though.The battery life is not great on these.  I really expected them to last longer. I know there is a rechargeable version, but those look more bulky and I am not sure they would fit my ears as well as these tiny ones do.A few times these seemed to loose connection as I can normally hear a faint static like sound in my ears when they are on (not sure if that is normal?) I took them out, opened the battery compartment on each one and then closed it again.  They seemed to be working after that, so I am not sure what's going on with that.I use an Android phone and the app to set these up was fairly easy to use, but much more basic than I anticipated as far as the customizations options.Overall, I think these will be useful for me until I can afford to get prescription hearing aids, but they are by no means life changing.  (I realize that their effectiveness will vary for everyone based on your type of hearing loss.)"
19,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,A Solid Value IF They Meet Your Hearing Needs,"When I saw these Sony CRE-C10 hearing aids available for review in Amazon's Vine Program I jumped at the chance to try them.  I was hoping to find that they would provide a better result than my Eargo 5 units that I acquired through my medical insurance in late 2021.  Although I haven't had an audiology exam in years, I am now quite confident that (at age 78) my hearing in both ears has deteriorated to the point that these tiny ""in the canal"" units that primarily enhance frequencies in the range of voices are simply not what I really require for my current condition.  I can tell a difference with and without the Eargo 5's in that TV voices are crisper and a little more distinct with them--but I still have issues with insufficient volume.  I also normally need to keep my iPhone in a speaker phone setting to handle most conversations.  With these circumstances, I suspect that my review of these Sony units is not really applicable to most users--but I own a review on them to Vine and so will provide my experiences.Another reviewer was critical of Sony's ""intake"" process, and I also found the need and process to create my necessary account cumbersome and time-consuming--which got things off to something of a bad start.  I had no issue downloading the app, but I quickly ran into difficulties trying to set up my Sony aids.  I carefully followed all the instructions about my phone adjustments, but try as might I could discern NO ""beep"" that was supposed to indicate the hearing aids being linked to the phone.  I tried the process multiple times, and finally lied to the program about hearing the ""beep"" showing the left hearing aid linked--just so I could progress to the right unit and see if that one was different.  No difference.  Again, I finally lied about the right hearing aid being linked to try to progress to the actual set-up process--but could not discern any of the set-up beeps.  I wondered whether my older iPhone 7 might be acting up and was not providing the required communication with the hearing aids, so resolved to try the process using another phone as soon as I was able access one.In the meanwhile I contacted Sony Support, and I need to give a five-star shout-out to that experience.  The responder from the Sony Team was quick, knowledgeable, and understandable.  I discussed my experience in some depth with her, and she concurred that what I reported would have been the proper set-up of my phone and I should have been achieving a link with the hearing aids.  The fact that I seemed to not be connecting with EITHER hearing aid indicated that my phone COULD be the thing at fault.  Since I was leaving on a trip the following morning, she gave me a case number and we agreed that I would try the process with another phone as soon as I could and would re-contact them if that didn't solve the issue.  It was 4 or 5 days before I had the chance to try another phone, and by that time the Sony Support Team had re-contacted me twice to try to check on things.  I didn't take the calls, because I had nothing to report, but the Team left voice mails saying they were trying to follow up.  They finally sent an e-mail saying they hadn't been able to re-contact me and asked me to please let them know if I was still having problems.  I don't believe I've EVER had a support experience in which the manufacturer was so proactive in trying to ensure I had proper support.When I was finally able to coordinate with my grandson and his iPhone, he was able to determine that I was actually getting the beeps indicating link-up with my phone, but they were fairly faint and I simply couldn't hear them.  As I then progressed through the set-up process, I could hear SOME test tones in each ear, but I simply couldn't hear enough of the test tones in the process to enable the program to determine a valid hearing profile for me--and it reported out as such.  Even though I've gone through the set-up again since then, I still can't establish a profile that would allow me to set up the Sony units, so unfortunately they are not going to work for me.I have included photos of the Sony and Eargo units--they compare fairly closely in size and design.  The Eargo 5 aids are more refined units, offering a choice of 4 programs by tapping the units in ear, and contactless recharging rather than battery changes, but when I got them they were priced at $2000--twice the price of the Sony CRE-C10s, although I think that price is reduced some now--two years later.  These Sony units look good, and are as comfortable in my ears as the Eargos, at least for the length of time I wore them.  I am confident in Sony's engineering and inherent quality, and I fully believe the several reviews that rate their performance five stars.  My own poor experience, I am sure, is due to my unique hearing disability, and while I had no issues setting up the Eargos two years ago, they provide no real improvement in my overall hearing ability either (as I previously reported).  I am going to assign my personal overall rating for these Sony units as a ""three"", which reflects both the positive aspect of my experience (Great Support!) as well as the lack of any actual help to me."
19,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,Stopped working after 18 months,"While they worked they were fine.  The right ear hearing aid stopped working over night. Cleaning, redoing the setup, and several new batteries did not help. These are way too expensive for just 18 months of service.  BTW... Warranty is only 12 months.  Will not buy again!"
19,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Work but take time to get use to them,My daughter lost partial hearing when she was young. While she has regained some of it she still struggles to understand people if she's not reading their lips. These help but they take some time to get used to and adjust them to your specific comfort level.
19,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Didn't work out for me; but still might be worth a try for you,"I've worn hearing aids for 15 years now. About 2 years ago I got Eargo 5s. They're okay, but I was hoping for better sound clarity so I tried these. To begin with, I struggled to get the app to save my hearing test settings.  It just couldn't get it. Wearing the Sonys always felt like my ears were plugged up, even with the smallest click sleeve, and I kept fiddling with them.  And I felt like I heard my voice in my nose (like when you wear earplugs). I couldn't really understand people any better, even after tweaking with the app (which is quite decent). Eargos were rechargeable, and I wish these had been too. These are cheaper than Eargos; so if they work for you it can save you some money, although you'll have to buy batteries."
19,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Like these much better than my previous Eargo OTC hearing aids.,"Very comfortable to wear and great sound.  The only thing visible from the ear is the pull cord.  The hearing test / setup was easy to accomplish; just READ THE INSTRUCTIONS.  Of course I would prefer not having to open the battery compartment to shut them off, but a switch would increase the size of the units and make them too visible.  The batteries are cheap and readily available.  They last about a week for me.  My previous Eargos were rechargeable, but they died at 2 years and the rechargeable batteries can’t be replaced.  They also accumulated much more wax because of their floret design.  They required much more cleaning than these Sonys.  I also believe the cup design seals much better than the florets, helping with feedback.  The Sonys are also much more economical than the Eargos brand."

I am a Musician and the aforementioned LATENCY DELAY left me with a sound that RESEMBLED HOLDING A LONG PIPE UP TO MY EARS!  Also had some PERSISTENT FEEDBACK!  I DID RETURN Them and will be looking for a Pair that has LESS THAN 10ms LATENCY TIME!
19,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,The best DIY hearing aids I have found,"These are great and the best DIY hearing aids I have found.  At least Sony did not put their name on inferior product, these meet the Sony expectation.  The volume has limits as top volume is much less than others.  Since the quality of sound is so much better I can live with clarity rather than volume because I really need meetings and table conversation help.  My hearing loss is not too bad  just high pitch sounds. These do great to compensate at business meetings and do not allow noisy environments to become unmanageable as the tree prior ones I tried.  They are small and unnoticeable and I like the disposable batteries so I never have to worry about rechargeable battery repair in the future.  Luckily, I found these after returning 3 prior DIY off Amazon and will keep these.  In a meeting of 37 people in a structured environment it went well and I did not have to ask anyone to repeat.  My brain felt relaxed and my psyche calm now that I can understand what people are saying with ease. That is why I needed them in the first place."
19,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,By Far The Best OTC Hearing Aid,"After trying several other options, I read a NY Times review that recommended these and found them much better than other more expensive products. The sound quality is exceptional, they are virtually invisible, and easy to set up using a smartphone. Although they do not stream music or calls through your phone, because they do not use a Bluetooth connection they don't inhibit you from using it for headphones or other Bluetooth devices."
19,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Batteries?,These were ok for my hearing but having to deal with batteries is a deal breaker for me.
19,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,the best hearing aid I found,"I am lucky to have found this  hearing aid.  I enjoy using it.  The sound is crystal clear.  The size is small so it is very comfortable.I have been searching for good hearing aids for a long time.  I read a major review article for the best hearing aids of 2023 and thought I would buy the top-rated one because all my prior purchases were not satisfactory.  However, the top-rated one only received a 3.5 rating from Amazon users.  This Sony hearing aid received 4.5 rating from Amazon users.  But for some reason, it was not mentioned in the review.  I thank the Amazon users who rated this product for my good choice."
19,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Game changer!!,"These hearing aids are fantastic!  I have been loosing my hearing for several years now, and I have been putting off buying hearing aids. The main reason is that I wanted a good quality hearing aid that would not show. These work great and it has been so nice to be able to take off the close caption on my television! As you can see I am bald and I did not want a hearing aid that would show. Unless I tell you I have them no one will know. They claim that the batteries will last up to 70 hours and they do. I can now hear and understand what is being said and do not have to constantly have to ask what did you say? I LOVE THESE!"
19,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great at what it is,"This product does what it promises at a fraction of the cost of Eargos. Everyone has very unique ear canals and a trillion different causes on why they need hearing amplifiers. Per my ear canals and need for hearing amplification, they work for me and are a quality product. If this product does not work for you, it is more likely than not particular to your situation than a faulty product."
19,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Invisible!,"Guys, this product is excellent. You just download the app, the setting is super easy, you get accuracy and it they are very comfortable. I had the other traditional hearing aids for years and always complained how uncomfortable and itching they were. These Sony ones are great! They come with three size bud fittings. I don’t even remember I have them on! You can program them individually according to the needs of each ear.Anyways, I love them and highly recommend them."
19,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Amplifies background noise,I was extremely disappointed with this product.  Not only was the tone very thin (even when I adjusted the tone control) but I found they amplified all the background noise to a level that made it even more difficult to hear the person who was speaking in front of me.  I would not recommend these hearing aids at all.
19,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,not able to connect because is not available for my country,"I bought this hearing aid for my 99 year old mother, but I have not been able to connect to program them because the app is not available for my country $1000 dollars to the trash can. Plus I bought a whole bunch of batteries.... so disappointed"
19,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Would not Recommend,Seemed to work fairly well for an hour before the battery compartment on one broke. It’s a poor design when you have to pull the battery to turn them off. Broke the first time I tried to remove one.

19,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Previously used by someone else,"When I ordered these hearing aids, I was unaware that they had been used by someone else. Disgusting."
19,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound and comfortable, but just too fragile?","The Good: They are comfortable and very discrete.  I have gotten good battery life of about 70 hours. They work well to improve my hearing, and I have no issues with wind noise.  These are made for people with moderate hearing loss like all the OTC hearing aids on the market.The So So: The setup requires a very quiet room to tune the response for both ears, I use a closet with the door shut.  After initial setup there are multiple tweaks that can be done to adjust for feedback, your own voice, or other sound issues.  These take some time to go through to get good results you can live with.The Bad:  After 6 months my left hearing aid went crazy loud.  It was so loud I couldn't put it in my ear for fear of making my hearing worse, and it wasn't responding to the setup app.  Fortunately Sony replaced the hearing aids after trying all possible fixes while on the phone with Sony help.The Really Bad:  Now 9 months after the hearing aids were replaced, the left hearing aid has gone bad again.  This time the aid acts like the microphone has died as it refuses to connect to the app or amplify any sounds.  The only thing it does is play the turn-on jingle after inserting the battery.  Fortunately the right hearing aid is still working fine.Other:  The setup app uses cellphone verification data that fails if you switch phones or carriers.  This results in the ""Not Available In Your Country"" error.  The simplest solution that I've found is to just create a new Sony account with a different email address.  Unfortunately you'll then have to go through all the setup and tweaking again if you want to make any adjustments to the sound.Bottom line:  They take time to set up, work well, but may fail within their 1 year warranty period."
19,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Used hearing aids,These were used by someone else. Disgusting!!
19,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wow! I can't believe the difference!,"The device comes with the Small click sleeve installed and XS, M, & L sleeves included in the box.  Switching the size is not for the faint of heart!  They are very snug and you really have to commit to removing them.  Installing the new size is easy (and less stressful).  Make sure you hear/feel the click to lock them in place. There is a clear tube that I assumed was an antenna but it is the way you remove the device from the ear.Once the app is installed and the fit is good you will walk through the setup process one ear at a time.  You do need a quiet environment for the initial setup!  The device emits a beep or series of beeps and you respond each time by selecting the number of beeps (if any) on your phone.  This is repeated a dozen times (or so) on each ear.These hearing aids do not require you to be near your phone to use them.  They only use the phone for initial setup or if you need to manually adjust the volume.  You cannot stream calls or media with these.These hearing aids are not rechargeable.  They use size 10 hearing aid batteries and they come with 6 in the box.  They also don’t have power buttons.  The hearing aids are on if the battery is installed and the battery door is closed.  If the battery door is open the hearing aids are off."
19,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very discrete,"I can't compare these to traditional hearing aids because I've never used those before. I work in construction and as I'm getting older I've had progressive hearing loss so I've been trying out different cheapo hearing aids to varying degrees of help. These are in a completely different league from those and the difference is pretty substantial in how much they help with my hearing.Using my phone (android Samsung Galaxy s23 ultra I had no problem getting the app. It did require an account being set up. Once installed the app was simple enough to navigate and the set up process was easy to follow.The fit is great and they are very discrete. My wife didn't even notice I had them in. No issues with comfort or them falling out. They are small, compact, and stay in place well.They came with a case and batteries."
19,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Prescription quality hearing improvement, at a lower price, though still pricey","These work extremely well to improve hearing, at least they certainly did for me. My main con about them, which ill just get out of the way early, is the batteries being so small! And they don’t seem to last a full 70 something hours that is advertised, but they do work great overall!They fit rather comfortably in my ear, I forget I’m wearing them after a few minutes, except for the fact that I can hear much better.The only other thing I had difficulty with is I had an initial snafu setting it up, which was my fault for not reading the instructions and making sure I turned my Bluetooth off on my phone.Overall, these were great and a major improvement to my life being able to hear clearly again, I didn’t even realize how many sounds I was missing out on.I can have my tv and music turned down to a much lower volume and hear it!Overall, I would recommend these for someone who’s got some hearing damage but not enough to get prescriptions. Keep in mind, they do not play music or calls, but they let you hear them a lot better!"
19,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Outstanding hearing aids!,"I got these Sony hearing aids for my uncle who has mild hearing loss. I was hoping to upgrade his current aids since he has been having issues,  and thankfully these are so much better than the others. He immediately was happy and said they exceeded his expectations.  He says they are the most comfortable aids he has ever worn, and they are easy to put in and take out. They have a sleek design and aren't overly bulky like his other set.  He was able to set them up to his liking quickly and they were simple to control on the app. He says the quality of sound is amazing, no horrible background noise and he can hear himself very clearly. This box includes everything he needs such as a case, different sized sleeves, 6 batteries, and care tools.  He is very pleased and so appreciative, which makes me feel great. They are a lot pricer than his last pair, but he says they are worth it in every way. Overall satisfied and would definitely recommend."

19,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Absolutely amazing,"Out of the 4 or 5 different sets of hearing aids this one actually works great. When people say ""you get what you pay for"" , you really get what you pay for. If you can find it cheaper I'd definitely do it. Or if you really need it and can spend the money, then definitely buy these."
19,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wow.,These OTC hearing aids work stupendously. My father is on the cusp of needing RX units but not there yet. We previously were using another big brand's devices and we thought they were the best around after trying multiple units. He took to these instantly and he could hear like he was when I young. You don't realize how much you lose before you even know you are losing your hearing. These brought his hearing back and he is so happy. The only gripe is he can't stream music directly to them on Android like you can with an Iphone. Excellent++ set of aids. Kudos.
19,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Work great and easy to setup and use,"I suffer from reverse slope hearing disorder, a very rare disorder that only affects a small percentage of the population. This means I have a hard time hearing low or bassy tones. I didn’t think I’d ever be able to flive a life where I didn’t have to say “huh” or “I didn’t hear you, I’m sorry” to people. I had learned to live with it, but then I discovered the Sony CRE-C10 otc hearing aids. I’ve tried many different otc hearing aids in the past and never found any that were comfortable, discreet and worked well. But these are different. I can honestly say I am living life to the fullest now and am so much happier since discovering these hearing aids."
19,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,ah!,"wonderful hearing aids. my father has mild hearing loss and usually he is wearing some pretty expensive pairs to help him now and then because he deserves the best there is. this one is not the most expensive pair he has used BUT it is definitely worth the extra dollars because of the comfort, ease of use, and quality of sound. really he is no stranger to Sony's quality and he was amazed with the hearing aids by Sony just as much as other products we've bought over the years. so far my dad has been loving this pair the most so I must say we recommend trying it at least."
19,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Hearing is back!,"This set of hearing aid is really quite surprising.  I was not sure if I could set this hearing aid up but I did.  By reading the instructions and watching each step , I got it set up quickly.  It is very comfortable to use and with the right setting, they seem to work good.I am not familiar to prices on hearing aids but I know this price is lower than some of the other I have seen.  I would recommend these to others that want to try hearing aids.  They seem well made and they do make it easier to watch and listen to the TV."
19,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Repackaged Returns,Item came already opened. Ear piece had ear wax from previous buyer (disgusting). The extra ear fittings were put back in package with scotch tape. If I am buying a $1000.00 product it better be new and unopened.  Returned immediately.
19,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Practical solution to moderate hearing loss,"Bought the battery one, and glad I did. The batteries last a long time, are relatively inexpensive, and the smaller hearing aid fits nicely in the ear and is hard to see from the outside. No regrets-downside is I have no excuses now when my wife asks me to do something!"
19,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,"If you lost hearing in one ear, do not buy this product.","I purchased this hearing aid thinking that it might aid me since my hearing in one ear is subdued. For my purposes, it didn't work at all. I went through the setup process as explained in the manual but I couldn't get past certain portions of the test since my hearing in one ear was so poor. The nightmare started when I tried returning to Amazon. I promptly returned the item within 1 day. After 16 days after they received the item back, I talked to Amazon's representative, Andy,  and he said that it'll  take 30 days to refund my money so I would have to pay for it on my credit card before they can refund the money. I explained that situation to their customer service and they turned a blind eye to make matters worse. I'm not buying anything of high value with them after this experience."

19,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,The change in your life could be profound,"Executive summary: the CRE-C10 is life-changing, and excellent! But there is much more to consider. Let me tell you what I've discovered:Straight off, the Sony CRE-C10 is a world apart from the inexpensive (mostly under $100) models, and unlike those, is considered a medical device, and as such is sales tax free in the USA. Because it's OTC (Over-the-Counter) you can buy it direct, without an Rx or a visit to a hearing professional. And although its price, at nearly $1,000, is high, it's much less expensive than one you'd buy from a hearing center/audiologist.I chose to purchase the replaceable-battery model (called the Sony CRE-C10), yet I'll also provide in this review a comparison with the rechargeable battery model that's called the Sony CRE-E10. The two are significantly different in size, appearance, and features, each with its own pros and cons. Which model you choose will depend upon what you value most. The rechargeable one has more features, some of which may be important to you. The replaceable battery model is virtually invisible. Thus, appearance might be a decisive factor.Indeed, at least for me, the most important difference is the appearance. While the C10s are true stealth tech and can't easily be seen, everyone will know you're wearing the E10s, which sit outside the ear and are black and seemingly as large as quarters.Will they get clocked as a hearing aid or a bluetooth speaker? Do you care?Here are some reasons to care:1. Vanity.2. Privacy.3. To combat ageism.4. To combat (illegal) discrimination due to being perceived as a person with hearing loss (e.g., job discrimination).5. Because you don't wan't to be seen as an older adult (or anyone) who is hearing impaired and thus a target for crime. While the stigma of hearing aids isn't anything near what it was 30 years ago, how you feel about yourself always matters.So, let's first talk about whether you need this, and also whether it will help you. Sony is clear that they classify this for use by people 18 and over who believe/perceive they have mild to moderate hearing impairment. That's basically part of the FTC's OTC ruling.The Sonys are meant to be adjusted (tailored to your specific hearing loss) solely using the app, without the intervention of an audiologist or hearing professional. There are the usual caveats and warnings about seeking medical help, etc., under certain specified circumstances. If these apply to you, follow the advice please.If you'd like a view from the medical establishment, Johns Hopkins Medicine has an online article covering Over-the-Counter hearing aids, and their FAQ includes their answer to the question, ""why should I see an audiologist before getting an OTC hearing aid?"" The tenor of the article is from the medical-professional side and is worth reading.Yet the FTC now allows you to purchase an OTC hearing aid, and thus you do not require a visit to a physician or audiologist before you buy one. Johns Hopkins also has a telling article entitled, ""The Hidden Risks of Hearing Loss,"" which is a must read; so please read it even though its conclusions might be surprising and are somewhat controversial. This is vital information that you and your loved ones should know, because it addresses hearing loss and a putative connection to dementia, its possible interference with ""some of the mental processing needed to walk safely."" Wow!To be clear, my input in this review is just from the point of view of a consumer who has purchased this because of a perceived mild-to-moderate hearing loss, and my advice is my personal experience, not medical advice.Let me describe my before-and-after experience:The 1st question you'll need to answer: Do you have 'mild to moderate' hearing loss? I'm pretty sure I'm over the mild, and a bit into the moderate.  See if this rings a bell, as most likely you can hear bells, like the loud ding on the desk of the concierge.But can you hear:Birdsong?Wind?The water faucet?Steam?The clinking of a set of door keys?The touch-tone pitches as you enter a phone number on the iPhone keypad? Or the various clicks on entering a text?People talking on their phones as they walk by, and what they're saying?Conversations?And critically: An approaching car!(And as a quick aside: If you are watching TV and someone tries to talk to you, especially from behind, and you feel annoyed, that's another clue to look for. It's your brain on overload trying to concentrate on two things at once. That's what it felt like to me.)Here's a kind of hearing test you might want to try before you buy: If someone says these two names to you softly, can you tell them apart?JanetJaniceThey differ only in the final sound, and the ""s"" which ends Janice is a hissing (voiceless) sound that will be difficult or impossible to hear if you have a lot of high frequency hearing loss. Yes, that's right. Even though most speech is mid-frequency, it's vital to hear those higher frequencies, as they affect your ability to discern consonants, especially initial and final ones, and thereby play a big role in intelligibility. There are two ways of saying that final ""t"" in Janet: with a puff of air (British) or without ('merican). I knew a lot of Janets and Janices, and it was a problem. Also, English requires hearing vowels clearly, lest pit/pete/pet/pate/part/put/putt are insufficiently differentiated. And if everything is muffled, it's hard to tell them apart.That's the before. Here's the after, which is the good news:All of the above normal sounds were pretty much inaudible (or very nearly inaudible) to me before firing up the Sony, and all are perfectly clear now. The water faucet near made me jump! And now I can hear the ""ding!"" of the toaster over from outside the kitchen, and can converse with people who speak softly even while they are wearing a medical mask. With the TV on. The difference is night and day. It's really worth something to not drive your friends crazy.Now, to be sure, even with a $100 low-price hearing aid, all of those normal sounds (birdsong, etc.) become audible, but not necessarily in a good way. Most of those less-expensive aids are not adjusted to your particular hearing loss, with the result that your likely perception may be that everything is loud, and annoying, so as a result you may not really want to wear them. Some of these low-price models have ""modes"", being different frequency curves, but they never helped me at all.My hearing loss, and quite possibly yours, too, is with the higher frequencies. After going through the steps to customize the aids in the app, Sony picks a frequency curve it thinks is right (and I wonder of there's some built-in AI intervention). But you can override, adjust, and question later on.Note that Sony believes, as do many in the field, that it may take weeks for you to adjust (it's your brain that's adjusting for you), but for me, not really. I've worn them for only a few days and I forget they're in. Until something beeps at me. From behind.Before I get to discussing the differences between the two models, I want to talk about what you get in the box, and what you have to do to make these work.There is manual that comes in the box. It is a model of excellence. It's superb. Every single step is made as simple as possible, clearly shown in drawings, and backed up by videos (QR codes are in the manual). You will need time, and you will need patience.Specific to the CRE-C10:Here are some things to consider: The #10 batteries are very small, and it takes dexterity to put them in -- and while not on the level of threading a needle, it's getting there. Putting the hearing aids themselves in is easier, and you will get better at it. You also get better at the batteries and removing the attached tab without pulling out the battery (practice, practice).You do not want to be starting off with these outdoors and have one land in the yard. The manual urges you to go slowly and in a quiet place. It's supposed to take I think 10 minutes, but it took me much longer.Putting the hearing aids in and taking the app's hearing test:Since I dove into this on a wing and a prayer, I freely admit that I was scared of little hearing aids that fit in the ear. (Sony refers to them as ""self-fitting Completely-In-Canal (CIC) hearing aids."") And although it might be scary at first to put something into ones ear, you'll be a pro in no time. Although the back end of the hearing aid sticks out by merely a few millimeters, a short built-in metal cord makes it easy to extract. Depending upon factors such as the anatomy of your ear canal and the size of the sleeve, the hearing aid might be flush, or a bit in, or a bit out, and this could be different for each ear. (There is actually a totally invisible hearing aid style (Invisible In-The-Canal, or IIC) but for my money, the CIC is invisible enough.)Before putting the CRE-C10 it into your ear, the aid must always be attached to its click-sleeve, a rubbery cone that comes pre-attached when you first open the box. You must never put the sleeve in alone, and you must never put the aid in by itself, they must always be attached.The first time you try to extract the hearing aid you may have trouble finding that short metal cord (it looks like it's an antenna. It isn't. Or it is, no one knows, at least not me. It's maybe a quarter of an inch long.) Do not panic. Feel around carefully and you will find the metal cord and be able to remove the hearing aid, which, by the way, comes with the Small ""click sleeve"" already attached, and Extra-Small, Medium, and Large sizes all on-the-ready should you need them.The manual contradicts itself, in one place saying that once you remove a sleeve you should discard it, and in other, instructing you to remove the sleeve to clean it.The click-sleeves snap into place. If you are attaching, say, a new sleeve to the hearing aid, in order to hear the confirming ""snap"" sound you may need to put it near ""the other"" ear, the one that still has its hearing aid in place. Definitely go for that snap, because it means the sleeve and the aid are firmly attached to one another. (You'll see how firmly the first time you try to remove a click-sleeve.)OK, it's in, here comes the hearing test:From my reading of both the C10 and E10 manuals, it appears the hearing test should be the same for both. You get to take the hearing test only after downloading the app and allowing it to synch with the hearing aids.The ""hearing test"" in the app moves slowly. It first plays (initially in one ear only) three tones. The tones are short, but they are longer than beeps. They are all at the same pitch, but they vary in loudness.Maybe on this first iteration they will go: loud, soft, medium. Or in a different order. And the app asks you ""how many tones did you hear? 0, 1, 2, or 3?"" This series of tones is repeated, and to the best of my memory, the tones are repeated softer, and the order of loud and soft is varied (but for you, maybe that will be different, as I said, I think there's an AI built into the app looking in and deciding what to do next). So, there were times I heard all three, or just two, or just one, and even, nothing. This is the app making a judgement of your hearing.Are you done? No you're not done. You're just getting started. Next the whole process will be repeated for a higher pitch (maybe two octaves up). Clearly this is to allow the app to judge your hearing loss by playing tones at different volumes, and and different pitches.Next, there is another series of tones, if I recall correctly at lower pitch, more in line with the pitch of male and female voices. The app will ask you to move on, and if you agree, and then, are you done?No you're not.You have two ears. So the whole thing now proceeds, all of it, for the other ear (left is first, right is next). Then you're done.Back to the setup:There are very specific instructions as to putting the batteries in and closing or not closing the battery door when you begin the setup. These will not seem to make any sense. Follow them. The hearing aids can detect ultrasonic sounds produced by your phone (you can't hear them, your cat can). Your phone app communicates with the hearing aids, not with WiFi (they don't have WiFi), not with Bluetooth (they don't have Bluetooth), but with some secret proprietary high-frequency communication system. Cool! (The rechargeable ones have Bluetooth. More on that later.)OK. Now you are done, you can put them it, try not to drop them (remember, choose your location carefully) and proceed to hear stuff you haven't heard in years.Everyone I tried them out on was astounded. They were finally able to speak at a normal volume. For the most part, this should help many marriages. Except the ones where someone is having a call they hope you can't hear. Kidding.(Not kidding.)So now you are wearing both aids, and you move on to possible further adjustments in app:The app (which is wonderful for the setup, but quite wonky for the menus, I mean, really not that clear at all) will allow you to set the overall volume. I think you will end up after the setup with the slider in the middle, giving you a lot of room to go louder or softer as needed. Always adjustable from your phone.The app also has a frequency slider, marked ""bass"" on the bottom and ""treble"" on the top. If you want to hear the effects of this as a self-test, just say ""shh"" to yourself and watch the difference as you amp up the treble. (The slider is really adjusting ONLY the treble, from minimal to maximum treble; it does nothing to the bass).There is another part of the app where you can adjust the volume (now called ""loudness"") separately for each ear, if you feel one is too soft or too loud. And while you already did this in the setup, it's nice to have this backup.There is an additional whole slew of adjustments that you can make, found in the app under ""fine tuning,"" which are presented to you as a series of ""problems"" and suggested solutions (numbered 1 to 4).One more note of interest: Before I used the Sonys I would see videos of classical music where the cymbals or the triangle or the snare drum played on the video, but were not audible to me. Bad engineering? Nope. It was me. Can hear them now.Now I'm going to get into the two different models, since this is important.PROS of the C10s (the model with replaceable batteries, which I reviewed here, which I use):Small, light, almost invisible in the ear. Much longer battery life (""up to 70 hours"") than the rechargeable E10s. Not a fashion statement. Stealth. These pros are strong reasons to opt for the small C10s!Guaranteed for a year, and with a stated likely life of 5 years.If you remember to bring along batteries you should not be left in the cold. Of course if you drop the batteries you will be. When I opened the pack they went flying (you get 6 to start and at around 25 cents each they could add up to $150 a year--or maybe just half that--depends how much you use them).CONS of the C10s:Difficult to insert batteries, at least the first time you try. I required a bright light and reading glasses. And even then, these suckers are small, under the size of an aspirin, and slippery.No Bluetooth. So you can't hear music through them. But you can still answer the phone. Hey you have hearing aids, so you can hear the phone now.Not waterproof. Do not take a shower in them! Think of them as delicate jewels: no hairspray, etc.PROS of the E10s (the model I didn't use, that has rechargeable lithium-ion built in):Rechargeable, so you can't run out of batteries. And, like the AirPods, the case itself recharges the hearing aids, I think up to three times. A full charge (like 4 hours) gives you ""up to"" 26 hours of use, or 23 hours if using streaming. Pretty bullet-proof.Water resistant.App will let you adjust directionality, so you can turn on or off (to whatever extent, no spec given) the front, rear, left, or right, and, for example, thereby accentuate only the forward (and further narrow its field like a zoom microphone). This should be helpful in noisy environments like restaurants, where you want to hear the person you're looking at. I don't own these aids, and I have no experience yet in restaurants with the C10s but I imagine, if it works well, it's potentially worth a lot.Preset curves start lower in the frequency range, and there are 6 the app choses from rather than 4. Does this matter? It might. The overall amplification appears that it might possibly be higher.Bluetooth! But not for Android, only for iPhone. So you can play music! I don't imagine the music will be on the level of Apple, but this might matter to you.CONS of the E10s:A fashion statement. People will see these. Will you be advertising your hearing loss, or will people clock these as cool bluetooth? I think they will become an unwelcome conversation starter unless you're OK with your hearing issues. And maybe you'll like the look. Lots of pix online to judge for yourself.Built-in lithium ion battery is not user replaceable. I don't know if one day it stops charging whether it can be replaced by Sony. No stated likely life. Do you want a lithium ion battery next to your ear?There is a potential for charging problems, as with any rechargeable item.You are advised to charge this every night, and warned if you don't charge for six months it might no longer accept a full charge.A bit more expensive, if you think of $300 as ""a bit.""Overall, I'm glad I chose the smaller C10s, because (and this is ironic, I know) I'd almost rather be seen as ""hard of hearing"" than caught wearing hearing aids and be seen as ""hard of hearing."" And there is a difference: in one case, you don't necessarily have to admit to the disability; in the other, you could be advertising it. Just being honest.So now you have it. They work, they're a bit of a chore to get started, but the app is extremely helpful. My experience was the best, and I'd recommend them to anyone willing to give them a try.*** Update May 6th, 2023:The other day, while reading in bed with my head propped up by my left hand, the left hearing aid fell out. Quietly. But I felt it slipping, so put it back in.I should have done more.Because later the next day I accidentally fell asleep (were both aids in?) and upon awakening the left one was again missing. I did not yet know it had fallen under the bed in an elaborate hearing aid escape maneuver, so frantically retraced my steps until I thought to move the bed, and whew! (BTW, the manual says you should not wear the aids while sleeping...)The lesson, which I did not learn until mishap #2, is this: If one ever slips out, then that needs to be addressed right away.This could have been a $998 loss, so I'd just recommend if you have doubts, do not go horseback riding just yet, and see how they fare for a while in safer locations. If one falls out, best to try other click-sleeve sizes.*** Update May 12th, 2023:Many sites stress that it's vital to keep the hearing aids dry; at minimum they should be stored with the battery door open (opening the battery door turns the hearing aid off). But I've decided to add a desiccant packet (in the 2-gram size silica gel packet -- they're very cheap by the hundred, and available on Amazon) which actually fits the small case included with the hearing aids.One more thing:If you misplace that small case, it could be hard to find. So I've put an Apple AirTag in the case. The AirTag, the 2 open hearing aids, and the silica gel pack just fit, if you put them in the order of AirTag, aids, gel pack on top. At least you'll know where exactly where they are hiding -- but you could need another pair of hearing aids to hear the AirTag's beep ;-)"
19,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Excitement to disappointment. Open, used items, missing parts. Sony Customer Service sucks.","Review of Sony CRE-C10 Self-Fitting OTC Hearing Aids for Mild to Moderate Hearing Loss, Prescription-Grade Sound Quality, Compact Virtually Invisible Design, Customizable App, and Replaceable Batteries, BlackI wanted to love these, and I did really like the size and fit and concealment. I received a used, open box, with the extra package of 6 batteries missing. There were already batteries in the hearing aids. There were what appeared to be earwax flakes in the hearing aids compartment. I contacted Sony customer service, if that’s what you want to call it. Once you manage to contact them (my only way was finally via text-chat), I was given a case number and the representative had no clue how to help me and told me that he “escalated” it, and that he would contact me or call me or email me by the end of day with a response. That was 2 days ago, and I still have no responses in any form!I went ahead and cleaned things up and found earpieces that fit best. I went ahead and tried the setup. I was so excited to get them and try them that I ignored the open box issue. The app sucks. It just sucks. Upon trying to set up my account with my preferred email address, it just kept telling me that I was using the wrong password. I tried resetting the password but never got any emails to do the reset. I ended up having to use a different email address and setting up another new account. It worked. The hearing test was very poor. Any tones played are barely audible, even at the highest level. Yes, I have had professional audiologist testing and have tried another brand of hearing aids. Those tones were all easily noticeable at various levels. I finally got the aids “paired” to the app and the app did its thing of doing the settings. I barely noticed any differences in the hearing than without the aids. Maybe it was because of the open box? Maybe they were returned because they were defective? I will never know. I returned them. I obviously could not count on customer service from Sony for such a little thing, so why expect any help on something major? I hated this too! I really did. I cannot afford the major brands and have no insurance. I wanted to hear conversations clearly and other such things again."
19,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Updated review,"Pretty good before the left one just stopped working after 3 months. For $1000, It's acceptable. I like how it fits discreetly inside the ear. Sound can be a bit tinny and echoey. Some feedback once in a while but not bad. I'm still using the right one. I'll try contacting Sony and see if they will give me an exchange.Update: My left one is working fine now. I think I had some bad batteries. They batteries come in packs of 6, and the one pack must have been old or bad. I wear them everyday, all day. I noticed that I can turn down the volume of my car speakers by 25 percent when I have them on. I watch a lot of foreign shows on TV so they dialogue can be hard to follow because of the accents. With these hearing aids I can catch a lot more of the dialogue by ear without reading the captions.It doesn't solve all of my hearing problems because some of it is due to my brain not processing speech as well as it used to. That has nothing to do with the volume of the speech. It does help enough though that I wear them all the time now. Some day I may splurge for custom fitted ones for that cost $6000 or more, but these will do for now.Update2: After reading some other reviews I realized that I need to fine tune the sound quality in the app.The fine tuning has made the sound quality almost perfect now. The echo and feedback are completely gone now. There is some very minor, mostly unnoticeable tinniness but the sound is so close to natural now that I sometimes check to see to if I'm still wearing them.Update3: Still using them everyday but there is an issue when changing the battery. Sometimes I need to close and open (turns off when it's open) the battery holder 3 or 4 times before it recognizes a new fully charged battery. After that it works normally until the next battery change. I think it may a problem with keeping the contacts clean. I have started to make sure to blow air into it to make sure there's nothing in the battery compartment."
19,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Super simple. Super small. Super comfortable.,"I haven’t worn hearing aids before, decided recently to try them. Started with highly rated top level Jabra. Hated them. Hard to get in my ear, and behind the ear piece ran into glasses earpiece. Very difficult to talk on cell phone because of touching the sound piece when holding up to ear. Yuck! $2000. Tried Eargo in-ear, way too big for my small ear canal. Hurt. $2500. Tried these inexpensive Sony, they’re great! Easy to insert, super comfortable, sound good, very easy to get in and out. Very simple operation, no unnecessary Bluetooth connections or superfluous settings to change. Batteries are great, small, and way cheap; kept forgetting to charge the others. Super satisfied where I thought hearing aids were gonna be an awful experience. Wow! Thanks, Sony!"
19,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent and reasonable costing in ear hearing aids,"I have gone the route that many of you guys, like me , are trying to work out which hearing aids work for me and I can afford. The behind ear aids were just not cool enough for me. ( I’m 74 but being a 60s teenager I’m Always going to be cool …. Tell me I’m wrong all you baby boomers and HI 👋 guys. We may have met somewhere down the road in the greatest decade of all. The 1960s , Hippies Hi ! Flower children Hi ! UK mods ( that was me !)  Hi ! . Ok so now we’re Old . Not for the feint hearted right. But guys , if you’re like me and still 25 in your mind. Wow , how cool is that. Just absorb that for a little while and remember how young and Sun tanned and healthy we were. Reminisce a while, like I do every day…. Any road up . I bought these Sony CRE-C10 hearing aids . Listen guys . They ARE discreet. They DO work. They don’t screech at you. There a great price for their quality. I had an issue downloading the Sony App . BUT 👈 I’m a total tech nerd. So if you have any problems with the Sony App call the number on your helpline provided with these amazing little in ear heading aids . Those helpline up guys are incredible AND so patient . Just like we need them to be. Right. BTW they take E batteries. BUT when rechargeable aids go out you have to replace the whole thing right! Big Bucks. Also BTW they come in black and you know what? They fit so far and discreetly into your ear…. Which is kinda a dark hole….. they really are NEARLY invisible. John W"
19,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Mark return date,I can’t hear. IMissed the return date by two days. They are comfortable and easy to adjust but I still can’t hear!  I was going to try and rerun it missed return by two days. My bad
19,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,The CIC model won't connect to the app using Samsung Galaxy phone,I tried to set the new hearing aids up and connect to the Sony hearing aid app.  I have a Samsung Galaxy S-22 Ultra.  I couldn't get them to connect.  I called Sony customer support and they told me that there have been issues reported with connecting with Samsung phones.  I will be returning them.  They seemed like they might be nice hearing aids but I will have to find some that will work with this phone.
19,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not for me but maybe you - LONG time for refund,"I don't like these but I think hearing aids are a very personal choice so I figured I'd give them a try. I don't like that they aren't bluetooth as I use my AirPods all the time for music, audiobooks, phone calls. These are very small so people who don't want anybody to know they are wearing hearing aids seem to really value that. They are very easy to insert once you get the hang of it. I never got the sound to sound normal but they tell me that that's almost impossible because if you are not hearing a lot of low sounds, you will now. No, I don't like that. BUT it's a personal choice. I am in the mild range of hearing loss so maybe a person with a high loss would benefit more. I am irritated that I dropped these off at UPS on May 17 and they tell me to expect a ""refund credited"" on June15. Sitting on my credit card, that draws interest."
19,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,High-end basics for a low-end budget,"The Sony CRE-C10 hearing aids are a joint effort by Sony and WS Audiology, a Danish company that also makes Rexton, Widex, and Signia hearing aids among others. The Sonys offer a virtually identical design to similar models of each of these other companies, but at a fraction of the cost. What’s missing in the Sonys are advanced features like switchable profiles for different listening environments, more sophisticated noise cancelling technology, tinnitus therapy options, and audiologist set-up/support. But the basic sound amplification and noise reduction are here, along with a phone app and ongoing tech support that compare favorably to higher-end counterparts worldwide. Finally, a great option for those of us with limited needs and tighter budgets.I found the Sony C10s while considering purchase of the Signia Silk 7X model, priced by my audiologist at $5800. Both models are battery-powered, which I prefer for dependability at my work. These two models -- Sony C10 and Signia 7X -- exemplify the similarities and differences discussed above. After two months of daily use of the Sony C10s, I’ve decided to stick with them for the next few years. At nearly $5K less than the Signias, they accomplish 80% of what I need: they sound good and are fully adjustable in numerous ways via the intuitive app. I do hate giving up the Signias' unique ‘notch therapy’ for tinnitus and may head that way eventually if my tinnitus worsens. For now, I’m very satisfied with these relatively inexpensive Sonys.For most folks with ‘mild to moderate’ hearing loss, I think the Sonys are a fantastic OTC option as long as one keeps expectations in check at this lower price point. My own high-frequency hearing loss is actually slightly worse than moderate, but the Sonys still make a wonderful difference in my ability to communicate comfortably as a teacher with my students. And in two months, no one has ever noticed my Sonys, even my wife until I told her. I like stealth!I’d suggest avoiding the Sony C10s: (1) if you have severe hearing loss, (2) if you don’t want (or are unable) to replace very small batteries every 4-5 days of full-day use, (3) if you don’t want to spend hours tweaking app settings to achieve the best sound, or (4) if you need the additional advanced features found in higher-priced models. I see these issues raised in some user reviews, and I agree.But if you can live with solid performance of basic sound amplification and background noise reduction, and if you like being fully in control, the C10s should be high on your audition list of tiny CIC models. These Sonys have significantly improved my quality of life, which prompted me to write this supportive review. Apologies for the length -- ouch! Regardless, I know that nothing works for everyone, and I hope you find similarly positive results wherever your own search leads.______________________________________________________P.S. IF YOU EVENTUALLY DECIDE TO AUDITION THE C10s… My hours of research uncovered two repeated suggestions from audiologists and users regarding how to minimize long-term repairs, costs, and frustration. I did both.1. Consider purchasing an electronic HA dryer/sanitizer to reduce daily moisture build-up, a potential problem particularly for small HAs that live deep inside the moist ear canal. I bought one of the highest-rated models on audiology sites (~$60 on Amazon).2. Consider adding an extended warranty. The C10s are a first-time offering from Sony, and tiny in-canal HAs tend to have more tech trouble than larger models. Paying a bit more upfront ensures at least a safe 3-year run, matching higher-end HA warranties elsewhere (~$130 on Amazon or Sony)."
19,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great, but could be even better!","This is an updated review since I have had mine a couple months.  This is for the invisible model - I didn't want any colossal thing hanging off my ears and the batteries are so each and cheap to replace that I'll take that any day.As others have mentioned - there is one major flaw in the software. One of my ears is pretty poor and the setup told me I can't use this. I literally had to repeat the setup 5 or 6 times to get past that step.  At one point some wishful thinking and lying and saying I could hear a tone finally got past that.The should fix the software not to utterly reject the user in this case.  What if over time that ear gets worse and I have to reset them? I'm supposed to throw in the trash?Which leads me to my next complaint - limited and simplistic software.  After setting them up they didn't work all that well so I used the ""customization"" feature a couple times and finally got them to work GREAT.But now I have a real fear of ever successfully repeating the step should I need to.  A simple way to save the settings would suffice. I should be able to save my settings.  Otherwise, Sony, when these need eventual replacement the new one may have to be returned. Try to name a product where you can't save the settings somehow?Once I finally got them customized they work really well if not perfect. I do have some residual feedback at times.  My ear that hears poorly is dramatically improved, proving they should have better software and let you use it even if it won't be optimal.  I have no intention of ever paying an audiologist for what is essentially the same thing, so OTC is my only option.The battery as I suspected is a non issue.  The Amazon Basics brand is practically free and it only takes a couple seconds to swap.  They last a long time and you get two different audible warnings before a battery dies so really not a big deal.If Sony could make a couple small improvements - allow you to save settings and let setup continue even if results won't be optimal - this thing would be just about perfect.Nowadays, I am wearing them more and more. I can watch TV with my wife again and let her handle the volume control. I hear background noises in the house I have not heard in years.Overall they are well worth the money!Edit: After a few months one failed. Sony sent me a replacement fast so I’m raising to 5 stars for decent service which is rare these days."

8,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Hearing Aids!,"This is my first experience with real hearing aids, and I’m definitely glad I bought them! They’re incredibly comfortable, completely unnoticeable to others and Eargo offers remarkable service. The audiologists are easily accessible and really know what they’re doing. I’m usually a DIY kind of guy, and I wasn’t sure how much they’d be able to help, but after my first telephone consultation, I can report that she definitely tweaked the settings to make them exactly what I’d been looking for. After two weeks of wearing them, they are so comfortable that I forget I’m wearing them. I’m a big guy, but the medium “petals” are the most comfortable for me. I noticed a slight tinny sound to voices and some minor feedback with my first settings, but the audiologist removed those issues right away. The battery life per charge is actually better than they quote. I expected to get a “low battery” warning after 16 hours of continuous wear, but I’ve gotten over 20 hours several times. When I take them out, everything sounds muffled and I have to turn up the volume on the TV, so I know they’re doing their job. The app lets me adjust the individual volumes, active noise cancellation and program selection (normal, TV, restaurant, mask, etc.), but I rarely have to do that. I just pop them in and the “normal” setting works great all the time. The app changes those settings by sending ultrasonic tones to the earpieces and it works great as long as the phone volume is turned up and the environment is fairly quiet. I noticed a couple of times that it didn’t change the settings, but I discovered in one case that sounds from a nearby air conditioner prevented it from working, and in another case outside the otherwise un-hearable chirps from an ultrasonic wind speed sensor in my Tempest weather station interfered. The simple solution was to go to a quieter area and use the app there. The bottom line is that they work great! I’ve recommended them to my 92 year old mother who’s noticed a decline in her hearing, too. Definitely a good purchase."
8,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product and a wonderful customer service team,"I have to say the EARGO customer service and follow ups are great.  Trying to get used to the EARGOS when first receiving was not hard but there were little things I could not figure out.  I had called your reps a few times and each time they were very helpful and informative about using the hearing aids.  If one person could not give me the correct answer an audiologist would give me a call the following dayI did have a little trouble with the Smart Match for my individual hearing but I had finally figured it out.  I had the Otterbox case on the phone and the hearing aids were not picking up the chirp of the phone correctly.  The app repeatedly told me to go to a quieter place, but trust me...I could have heard a pin drop.  Once I took the case off of the phone the Smart Match worked and I was good to go.Very impressed with the app and I am still learning but for the most part, I think the EARGOS are going to work for me.  I have a phone meeting with one of your representatives today and I am compiling my questions on the hearing aids for the meeting.  Hopefully they will be worked out.For me this was a no brainer....45 day return if I feel these are not working, no batteries to fumble, two day delivery from Amazon and a $300 discount on the aids.  I don't have anything to compare these too but these little guys help tremendously.  Thank you"
8,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,My excellent experience with Eargo 6 devices,"I purchased Eargo 6 devices three months ago from Amazon Prime.They were delivered by FedEx promptly and well packaged in short order.I had some slight difficulty confirming the two year warranty online, but the company  representative contacted me by email and confirmed that the product registration and warranty were recorded and in effect.After the initial setup, a phone conference with a representative went over the product's features and reviewed the settings the ""Sound Check"" application had selected.I should mention that my hearing loss at age 79+ was mainly high frequency and that I ignored it for a considerable time.Conversations with my wife were often punctuated with ""what"",""I'm in another room"",you're not talking loud enough"" ...all the usual excuses for hearing loss!Finally a week long multigenerational family vacation convinced me to remedy the situation.All were relieved when I announced my intention to address the loss.What a difference the Eargo 6's made.Conversations are much clearer...Television movies no longer require text enabling...phone calls are a breeze...the high notes in music now ring true.I also love the fact that the devices are virtually invisible and are easy to insert and remove at night.A recent software update offered by the company was accomplished without difficulty.As you can tell,I am completely satisfied with the Eargo 6 product and look forward to years of improved listening.Jon"
8,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great in an office environment,"I bought the Eargo 6 because I was having a difficult time hearing the people I work with and my board of directors and they worked great for that. People who I struggled to understand now come through clearly in both individual settings and in meetings. I have not had equal success in other settings like restaurants or my car where you have a ton of outside noise. I've also been very impressed with the level of support provided by Eargo. They provide help with the initial set-up and then a call with an audiologist that I found very helpful, she even provided a text number if I have additional questions or issues. I've only had my Eargos for about a month but so far I am very pleased."
8,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Eargo 6 Hearing Aids,"I am a first-time hearing aid user. During my yearly physicals my Primary Care Physician did basic hearing tests. The results showed age-related hearing loss. I wanted to avoid the trouble of having to schedule appointments at hearing centers so I chose Eargo because they were professional-grade devices with very good reviews.It has been about a month since I first started using the Eargo 6. I was delighted from the start and my experience has improved ever since. There has been a learning curve but it has been easy and well supported by Eargo professionals. No big issues, just help in getting the optimum experience.This included the assignment of a personal care specialist who is very personable and has provided some tips that I wouldn't have thought of doing. For example, I thought the iPhone app was ""buggy"" because I had to hold it close to my ears to change certain settings. He suggested I use a toothbrush and spray air (canned air used to clean computer keyboards) to clean-out the iPhone speaker grills. It solved the problem!Based on my very positive experience I highly recommend the Eargo 6 hearing aid."
8,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,Didn't work for me,"I have had professional hearing aids before.  Wanted to try these to save some money.  I found that these squealed when I put cell phone up to my ears, which I cannot hear but my wife definitely could.  Also some sounds like piano playing on hold music and some construction noises sent them into a feedback loop.  Which I called their customer support regarding and they did attempt to change settings but the issue continued.  Also occasionally I had issues with pairing to the Eargo app.  That usually happened after driving as my phone would pair to the car.  I also noticed that the charger case battery seemed to need recharging daily and would keep the aids from pairing if it was dead.The sound quality wasn't as good as my old professional hearing aids.  I really wanted these to work but sadly I returned them.Thankfully Amazon was quick to refund my money after receiving them back.  Give it a try if you like but I'd steer you to others."
8,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Thank you for this quality product.,"When I first received my hearing aids I loved the fit, finish, and immediate improvement I experienced! However, the charger would not ""talk"" to my iPhone in order to bluetooth. I contacted customer service and they were superb. Long story short, after going through about 3 different agents and multiple attempts, we agreed that the charger must be defective. You all arranged for a new charger to be sent to me and for me to return the original.Within days, the aforementioned exchange happened. I got my Eargos paired with my iPhone and VIOLA I am a happy customer.I have 6 grandkids. I WANT to hear them and now, I do. I also do occasional substitute teaching which absolutely requires good hearing skills...my EARGOs are fitting the need. Also, everyone who knows that I am using hearing aids has commented on the amazingly discreet nature of the EARGO...no one has noticed them until and unless I point them out!Thank you for this quality product!"
8,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,small yet powerful,"I have been wearing a single behind the ear hearing aid for more than a decade. I've been told I should wear two, as my hearing is degraded on both sides.With the opportunity to try out a pair of Eargo 6 in the ear devices for less than the price of my last hearing aid, it was an easy decision. Thus far I have been impressed, the devices are quite light yet powerful and functionally on par with my high end hearing aid. The support has been better, as well. I am not sure I have all the possible settings dialed in, as yet, but I have a dedicated resource for help and advice which is a huge improvement vs going to see may audiologist.The performance has been good, and I am adapting to the ""petals"" vs my custom molded earpiece without noticing any real difference - if anything the petals are easier to clean. so far I'm very pleased."
8,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,A great product which I would highly recommend to anyone who would listen.,"My story is that for a few years now my hearing had been diminished. I tried a hearing assisted device to no avail. Recently realizing that my hearing issues were getting worse, I decided to venture into the maze of ""hearing aid land"".After much research, I decided to go with the Eargo 6 which seemed to be the best product for me. I can't begin to tell you how satisfied I am with this decision. As you may know, this product is an in the canal earpiece that is not visible to anyone I have in-person contact. Different program settings with background noise reduction are marvelous features which I do utilize.I own this set now approximately two weeks and I believe I have attained my comfort level rather quickly, notably with the excellent assistance of Eargo's hearing assistance professional.Thank you Eargo for such a great Product."
8,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,The wife doesn't have to keep repeating herself.,These hearing aids are easy to use and work well. Being able to adjust the settings on my phone is especially convenient. Customer service has been excellent. I did lose one hearing aid while shoveling snow but a single phone call got a replacement quickly.
8,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Eargo hearing aids are definitely worth the price!,"Delivery was prompt, packaging exceptionally protective of product.  Hard copy instructions very clear and easy to follow.  Extra parts - petals, mic covers - are included for experimenting with hearing and fit comfort.  Unique and practical magnetized charger keeps hearing aids in proper positioning for charging and is very protective.  Hearing aids are easily programmed by app or simply tapping your ear.  Where I am employed masks are required, and Eargo has taken the guess work out of what people are saying in muffled voices behind the masks.  Tech support is exceptional!  I was contacted personally by phone and also by email, and was very happy with the helpful hints and personal attention.  Overall I am very impressed, and recommend Eargo hearing aids for assisting with moderate hearing loss!"
8,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great Service,I received my Eaggo 6 hearing aids from Amazon promptly.  My connection to Eargo and Eargo services was seamless.  I enjoy enhanced hearing with my devices.  My only regret is that I have to take out my Eargos and replace them when I want to listen to a podcast or music privately--then I have to use my Earbuds--otherwise a great choice for me!
8,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Hearing again,"Eargo works very well for me.  It feels as if a filter has been lifted off my hearing and the world has reopened.  It's a wonderful feeling.  The portability of the device makes it easy to travel with in my purse.  Charging is fast and I've never had hearing aids lose their charge during a day, no matter how many hours I wear them.  They are easy to clean and maintain and the customer support is always there if you need it.  I do wish that it could Bluetooth with my phone both for music and calls.  Perhaps in the next iteration.  Overall, a well priced, well working device that makes my life easier.  Highly recommended."
8,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are wonderful!,"I purchased these for my husband who had used two different brands that our ENT's office sold.  He was very unhappy with the quality, noise control, look and comfort.  Since these hearing aids were less expensive than the ones he had previously tried he was not sure if they would be any better.  He loves them for the quality, size and noise reduction.  The size is incredible as you can not see them in his ears.  His hearing is greatly improved even in crowded restaurants or parties.  I no longer have to repeat myself or speak louder.  So far we both love them.  I would definitely purchase a pair for myself if I needed them!"
8,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Don’t talk too loud! I can hear you!,So much technology in these micro earbuds.Great to watch TV and crystal clear sound even in restaurants with my friends.I also  appreciate the sound customization setting from  smart phone if needed.I have my earbuds since December 2022 and it is making a great change in my quality of life. I am 79. Thank you Eargo.
8,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,They helped me significantly.,"They helped me significantly. I don't ask ""what?"" near as often. I don't depend on closed captioning anymore. Recently my wife asked me to turn the TV up. I could here it fine. IMPORTANT: The hearing aids are controlled thru an app on your smartphone. Check with the company to be sure your phone is."
8,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best hearing aid so far, more affordable","This is the 3rd ""customized"" hearing aid I wear, other 2 by big box membership & franchise retail location, and by far is the best fit/sound/price. I have severe hearing loss on one ear which it helps but can't fix, and less severe on the other ear which works wonderful!!! Easy to wear, friendly app and programs, programmable like you go to a hearing specialist, etc. I also go to hearing specialist and their results are in par to those obtained by programming my Eargo 6. Biggest drawback is the app can be glitchy but close/open usually works plus new app releases are working better!"
8,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very Please with my Eargo 6’s.,"I like everything about the devices.  I never expected such a good fit nor such comfort.  As an older women, I appreciate the near invisibility. Call it vanity.  I do have trouble with squelch with the treble at concerts and background music on TV programs.  However, we will work to resolve that.  The app is good and the follow up from the audiologist is extremely helpful.  All in all, I would recommend Eargo 6.  P. S. I’ve had other over the counter brands of hearing aids, and the Eargo 6’s are the best by far."
8,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,Started out great - batteries don’t last,"Purchased these for my husband. He was very impressed with the sound quality. He used them every day for about 8 months,  cleaning them on a regular basis. The battery life was originally about 12 hours but has slowly dwindled to about 3-4 hours before needing to be charged.  We are going to attempt a warranty exchange. I will update this review after that."
8,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Eargo6 delivers as promised.,"Having tried a variety of amplifiers in the $2-300 range, I felt it was time to pay more see if the difference in cost was worth it. For me, after a full month I would have to say it is worth the money.I’m nearly 79 and years of working in heavy (metal on metal) manufacturing has taken its toll.The Eargo6’s are a quality in-the-ear product. The hearing test is first rate. The app makes the product very friendly/useful. The customer service (audiologist) has been very informative and friendly.The product does exactly what I was promised.During last week’s vacation on Cape Cod, my oldest son remarked,”Dad, you haven’t said ""what"" once this week.The Eargo6’s are a very good investment. Highly recommend.UPDATE, 13 MONTHS LATER - Be Aware of short battery life & no replacement!After 8-9 months of daily us and charging/cleaning/replacing accessories as recommended, I noticed the batteries losing strength. Instead of getting the “low battery"" audio msg after 12 hours of use it has worked its way down to about 6 hours. Of course warrantee is 1 year.$2600 for 1+ year of service makes the Eargo product a bad investment for me. They don’t offer battery replacement so you’re talking $1500-2000/year. Not good!"
8,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,So many sounds...,"I looked at OTC hearing aids for months before choosing Eargo 6....and I'm glad I did.  The sound quality is excellent, they are comfortable, and no one has yet to notice I am even wearing them.  Because of the noise canceling, I especially appreciate having them when in noisy environments.  The charging case design is brilliant and it fits well in my pocket.  And customer support has been awesome in answering my questions and helping with adjustments.  An excellent investment!"
8,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Just the kind of hearing aid I was looking for!,"I love the small size and how it fit into my ear canal to be more inconspicuous than any hearing aid I have seen to date. Sound quality is excellent and my restaurant conversations are far more enjoyable now that I have the Eargo. I only have mild to moderate hearing loss so these are just perfect for me. If you have been hesitant to jump in to the hearing aid life, like I was, these are definitely worth a try."
8,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Eargo sent me a replacement for my rt ear after I sent in a request.,I use them every day. Now that the rt earpiece has been replaced.  Before it was terraced the rt ear sounded too soft.
8,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Pete E. Excellent hearing aids,"I purchased the Eargo 6 last spring. They are my third set of Eargo and the best so far. The sounds are clear, and noise reduction very effective. Eargo has figured out how to better clean them by adding removable caps over the microphones. I did have a problem with one of the devices. Customer service was immediate and a new one was sent within days. These are not cheap hearing aids. But, you get what you pay for. Eargo is a high quality product.Pete E"
8,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Arrived non-functional and no support,"Product arrived, initially it appeared the charging base and hearing aids were functional. The android app paired with the base and spent an hour doing a software update. When that was done, the app was not able to control the devices at all -- which it does via sound, not bluetooth. I followed app instructions for setting phone volume, no good, tried higher volume, low volume, nothing worked. I put in a support call and was asked to make an appointment 2 weeks from now. Meanwhile the charging base stopped working completely - no longer connected to phone, no lights, no sign of life at all. Tried support again and was told it would be a 3 day wait at a minimum just to speak with anyone. Seriously, cannot believe this company expects people to spend $3000 on their product, have it not work for whatever reason, and expect customers to wait days, weeks, on a chance of getting some kind of support. So, thankfully the defective return process here is as easy as can be, sending these back and buying a different brand."
8,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Long time hearing aid user, best set by far.","The quality of manufacture, sound quality, ease of testing and expertise of the online and phone contact help, could not have been better.Eargo aids are almost unnoticeable, you can easily forget you have them in your ears.Have had to bail out of the shower (twice).I have recommended to many friends and one has already bought a set for him and her.All in all, a great experience."
8,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,A Quality Product,"I am quite pleased with the quality of sound and the various app programs. The latest software version appears to have solved the slow reaction time when switching between programs.As a Quality Leader for a Fortune 500 Personal Care Medical Device company, I am pleased with the quality of the product and service Eargo provides!Brian C.Neenah, WI"
8,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Certainly hear better,I have been quite impressed with the Eargo product.  I certainly hear better.  The biggest surprise has been that I hardly notice them in my ears. I know they are there because I hear different and sometimes strange sounds.  But I hardly feel them.  I am getting accustomed to the unusual sounds after a month and realize most of these are sounds that were there before but I didn't hear.  The bottom line is that I like them.

8,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Eargo medical hearing aids,"I have purchased a set of eargo 6 hearing aids, at first I had some trouble with them but the eargo audio team worked tirelessly with me until they got everything working perfectly. They are well designed and you can adjust the sound to any setting. I loved them and recommend them to anyone interested."
8,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,These hearing aids changed my life,"I have been an Eargo customer for more than three years and I couldn’t be happier. My Eargo devices have changed my life. My wife and I enjoy going to the movies and live theater. Prior to getting my Eargo devices, I had great difficulty hearing the dialog in movies and had to use assistive hearing devices at live theater. I know don’t miss a word!I love the ability to adjust my Eargo devices using the app on my phone. I can actually hear conversations at my table in a noisy restaurant.Customer support is outstanding. The support team does everything possible to make sure that you get the most from your Eargo hearing aids."
8,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent product,The Eargo 6's work very well. The sound from the previous version is better and softer. I'm pleased with the product and happy to recommend them.
8,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Can't hear? Eargo is the answer!,"If you have trouble hearing and considered hearing aids only to be put off by their exorbitant cost ($6000+), then you might want to give Eargo a try. For under $3000, you can get a pair of Eargo hearing aids without a prescription.They take a bit to get used to like any hearing aid would. But Eargo has exemplary customer service professionals to help you navigate all things Eargo. The best part of their customer service is they are all Eargo users themselves so they are able to give first-hand advice.As for battery life, I put them in in the morning and wear them all day without having to recharge them. They usually have about a 1/4 to 1/2 charge remaining when I get back home in the evenings. And the best part? They're nearly invisible to the outside world. Only you will know you're wearing them. They also come with 4 presets to help you hear better in certain situations, such as in restaurants, watching TV, or sitting in meetings. I typically don't wear them when using headphones, however, I did try them and was surprised that there was no feedback. Obviously, you will not be able to wear Eargo and earbuds at the same time.Bottom line, if you want an ""over-the-counter"" solution to high-cost hearing aids, you can't go wrong with Eargo. The only reason they don't get a 5-Star rating from me is because nothing out there can simulate our natural hearing when not suffering from hearing loss."
8,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Failed after 3 monthes,"Hearing aids wouldn't charge, charger shows fully charged but they won't connect to phone.Several calls to support only get a script to clean the units with no resolution. I kept removing and replacing unit in case until they would connect phone only to have low battery message in my ears even though charger shows full charger. Another call to support and again i get script to clean. Now trying full discharge reset (2 days unplugged) then probably another call to support to have them tell me clean them again.Can not recomend these."
8,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Customer Service runs hot to non-existent.,"Purchased Eargo 6 direct from company. Initial orientation was fine and learned their open ear petals worked better for my situation.Their specialists worked with me on multiple occasions to fine tune my experience and were great. I decided Eargo was not for me me cause the fit in my ears was extremely uncomfortable- but that’s me, not them.One of the devices was charging intermittently so they sent a replacement which arrived a week later. By that time I’d decided to return the whole thing - along with the replacement - for a refund. Return process was easy and I received a refund to my card right away.Since then I’ve been reminded to return the proffered “replacement” or risk being charged. Have received 4 follow up emails in this regard. Have talked to the reps and sent multiple emails about this and have been assured that it was taken care of. Apparently not as a fresh reminder arrived this morning.To sum up - good product, great staff, product will not fit some people, follow up procedures are hot and miss. Would have been a terrific experience, even with my fit problem, except for the breakdown in internal communication noted above. Given the high cost of the devices I would have expected 5* service at every step."
8,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Eargo 6 Review,"Having bought Eargo Max a number of years ago, it was time for new hearing aids. Eargo 6 has been an excellent product so far and the enhancements from the original Eargo's I had are remarkable."
8,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth the price. You get what you pay for.,"I have had them and been using them for about 7 weeks now. All I can say is that they are exactly as advertised. The first time I wore them around family, I had to tell them (after a while) that I had them on. No one could see them but they did notice that I was acting differently. I could actually understand everything that was being said and didn’t have to ask anyone to repeat themselves. I now refer to them as my clearingaids because that is exactly what they do (clear things up). My wife is happy, my family is happy, and I am very happy.The support from the Eargo company and support team has been exceptional from the first time I spoke to them. The instructions and videos make it extremely easy to set the hearing aids up and maintain them to keep them in top order. I would recommend cleaning them every night before placing them in the charger. They will then be ready to go the next morning.The product may seem a little pricey compared to the cheaper products you see advertised,  but I would highly recommend them. This is a case of “you get what you pay for”."
8,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent Hearing Aids for Active Lifestyles,"I've been using Eargo for more than five years, and they fit perfectly into my active lifestyle.  I'm a cyclist, work out daily, and have two very active children.  I've always had hearing problems for as long as I can remember.  And at age fifty-seven, I continually need to improve my hearing due to natural aging.I've tried the behind the ear models with replaceable and rechargeable batteries.  It was difficult to wear glasses/shades, battery life was too short, and maintenance was time-consuming with doctor visits and retesting.The Eargo devices (I have the Eargo 6) fit naturally inside the ear (almost invisible), and the sound is simply excellent.  I can wear eyeglasses/shades, quickly charge nightly (about 16 hours per charge), and the newer Eargo 6 is waterproof great for cycling.Most important, the Eargo phone app allows me to test my earing monthly and recalibrate the earpieces individually per your test results.  It's the same test you'd take at the ophthalmologist's office but in the privacy of your home.  You can also customize/adjust settings (normal, restaurant, meetings, music, etc.) to ensure you are hearing and enjoying both outdoor and indoor experiences, especially in noisy, crowded places.They are easy to maintain with an occasional cleaning.  You have access to several informative maintenance videos, plus get upkeep reminders via the app.As part of their effective support system, you can always contact one of their certified, licensed hearing professionals if you have any issues, have questions, or need advice.The devices carry a two-year warranty.  Regardless of brand, all hearing devices require repair and replacement due to the tremendous usage and maintenance.  Eargo warranty is on par with everyone else; however, their support is a considerable step above others as you can get replacements shipped within twenty-four hours after diagnostics.Eargo is constantly improving the devices and hearing technology.  Their support has always been fast and responsive.  The devices are easy to purchase and use.I enjoy wearing the very comfortable Eargo devices daily, plus the sound quality is terrific, as mentioned above.  Now I can hear ""everything"" the kids say and ask for (whether I want to or not ... LOL).  I'm definitely a lifetime customer and look forward to better products."
8,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Feel like spending $2,500 every two or three years?","I just wanna say that I have the original Eargo model and the right ear device no longer holds a charge. Let’s be honest. There’s more technology in a pair of Apple AirPods, and for 1/10 the price, so I’m not sold on how “sophisticated“ the electronics are. I can say that the almost invisible design was why I bought them in the first place, but I’ll be damned if I’m going to spend nearly $2500 on a product it only has a two year warranty. Outrageous!"
8,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent Devices,"First the Eargo technology is very impressive…to be able to design a very effective hearing aid into such a small device is a great accomplishment.And working with the Eargo Audiologists…Jerry and Amber has been excellent. Both have been professional, knowledgeable and patient with my many questions.With full disclosure I bought my Eargo 6 devices directly from Eargo. I purchase a lot of items through Amazon but because these were my first hearing aids I wanted to use the slightly longer ‘return period’ that came with buying directly from Eargo. However now that I have experienced the devices, and Eargo’s service, I would not hesitate to buy them from Amazon."
8,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,The invisible and spectacular EARGO 6 hearing aids.,"These hearing aids replaced behind the ear hearing aids.  The hearing aids are small, rechargeable, very comfortable, programmable, and do not interfere with my glasses. Not only are the hearing aids awesome, the employees of EARGO are super. I am upgrading to the next generation of EARGOs. WOW!!"
8,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very happy with purchasing Eargo6.,"I am very satisfied with my Eargo6. The product is virtually invisible, and it has made a major difference in my ability to hear. The product is comfortable and does not interfere with wearing glasses or masks. The Eargo6 is easy to adjust. The company has been exceptional, and very professional! I am most satisfied."
8,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Yes, they are THAT amazing","I was hesitant to get hearing aids for 2 reasons: the first was an ego thing (I didn’t want those things hanging out for everyone to see); and the second was I wear glasses, and when I tested the over-the-ear devices, they were uncomfortable and caused my glasses to sit awkwardly.Then I saw an ad for the Eargo hearing devices. Honestly, they looked impossibly good: virtually invisible, easily programmable, rechargeable, reasonably priced, they had a really cool case, and they were returnable for 45 days. Too good to be true, right?No. The Eargo 6’s are amazing. They are slightly smaller than the diameter of a pencil and come with an assortment of soft, interchangeable “petals” that go on the front and ensure a comfortable- yet-firm fit in my ear. To get them out, I gently tug on the nylon string (like fishing line) attached to each device.Pairing the devices with the Eargo app is easy, and it gives me programs to choose from - Normal, Restaurant, Music, Phone, and TV - all of which have been programmed to add or eliminate certain things in certain conditions. But the app also allows me to customize each of those programs by changing volume, treble, and bass either in both ears or each one separately. And any changes I make are made immediately - as long as I have my phone nearby.Customer service so far has been great. I initially spoke with Tyler, who was friendly and very helpful in answering my questions. Later on that week, I received 2 emails: one on how to clean, charge, and get the perfect fit. And the next on how to change programs and personalize the hearing aids.  Then I received an email from an audiologist, setting up phone appointment to answer any concerns I had with the devices. I just finished that appointment, during which she addressed some concerns (nothing major) , and she also tweaked one of my Eargo programs over the phone.I’m very happy with my Eargo 6 devices. I can’t imagine another company offering the comfort,  flexibility of programming, or customer service at such a reasonable price.And no, this is not a paid promotion…"
8,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best I've tried!,"I grew up in the country, shooting extensively. As a result, I have moderate high frequency hearing loss and significant tinnitus as diagnosed by my ENT. I’m 64 now, and my hearing has grown worse over the years.I bought over-the-ear hearing aids years ago, but they are problematic because I wear glasses. I also wear a mask often because I’m susceptible to Covid (due to lung damage from pulmonary emboli). Wearing my hearing aids with glasses and/or a mask was very uncomfortable.So, when quality hearing aids became available over-the-counter, I started looking for an aid that was entirely in-the-ear. I found several options with a Google search. After that, I relied most on reviews from the Better Business Bureau, Consumer Reports and CNET to narrow the choices.In the end, Eargo was the obvious choice based on its technology, support, and user reviews. I did the online hearing screening, spoke to a sales representative at Eargo, and placed an order for a pair of Eargo 6s.It’s very fair to say that Eargos have changed my life. I can hear all the outdoor sounds I’ve missed for so many years…bird songs, crickets, frogs, squirrels rustling in the leaves. I no longer say “what?” constantly to my wife and friends. I keep the TV volume at a low 8 to 10, compared to the 25-30 that ran my wife and two dogs to the other end of the house. I can hear and participate in conversations. And my tinnitus isn’t as noticeable. I suppose that's because my brain is receiving sounds that weren’t making it through before.I had no adjustment period, as far as fit or discomfort, because I’ve worn hearing aids before. The support calls I’ve received from my Eargo audiologist, Cheryl, have been friendly and helpful.Within a week, I recommended Eargo 6s to my brother-in-law, who also has hearing loss. He purchased a pair and is wearing them daily. He opted to do so without Eargo support and is happy as well."
8,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Poor company to deal with,"Adjusting Eargo to the listening environment is nearly impossible. For example, to optimize for a restaurant environment, it is necessary to be in the listening environment, remove the devices from your ears, place them in the Eargo case, change the setting, reprogram, reinsert, test, and repeat the process if unsatisfied. Repeat this procedure for each listening environment, such as meetings, crowds, theatre, phone, and TV.Given the number of potential settings, I find this process difficult to manage. I complained after the purchase, and Eargo told me the small form factor prevented having the features I wanted. I decided to endure because they were comfortable hearing aids. But less than 12-months later, they introduced a version that addresses these issues.Knowing that I could be throwing good money after bad (fool me once), I was willing to risk paying 1/3 ($1,000) of the total purchase price to trade in, but they refused.User's recommendation: Bad company - Don't buy."
8,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Eargo 6 is a game-changer!,"There is everything to love about the Eargo 6 hearing aids!  They are virtually invisible and fit comfortably in the ear, so nobody knows I’m wearing them.  The sound quality is crisp and clear, and you can personalize your settings with the easy-to-use app.  If you need help, the support team is friendly, efficient, and knowledgeable.  Be prepared to be wowed by the whole experience!"
8,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Stopped working after about 8 months.,They worked fine for about 8 months when I noticed very little difference when I put them in. Eargo replaced them and the same thing happened about 8 months later. Eargo replaced them again at no charge. This third pair stopped working soon after the 2 year warranty expired. Enough was enough. I just tried Lively Hearing Aids and they actually work better than the Eargos. Even though they are “behind the ear” my wife says she cannot see if I am wearing them.
8,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,The eargo application can only be used in USA SO IF YOU  TRAVEL OUTSIDE THE APP. DOES NOT WORK,"A BIG DRAWBACK , if you travel outside USA can’t uses application"
8,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product,"I bought these directly from Eargo because it was easy and their customer service was great. I have been wearing them for 2 months now and I can say they have been fairly easy to get use to as I hardly notice them in my ears anymore. These things are small and most people don't notice I wear them but it makes a BIG difference in what I can hear. That was big surprise to realize how much I couldn't hear. I love the tech and how I can adjust them with an app. If I need more help, their customer service is right there!! I would but from them again!"
8,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Not just the best Eargo but the best hearing aids out there,"I upgraded from an earlier version of Eargo to the Eargo 6 model this past month.  My wife and I are very active, we travel and I needed a device that I could use everywhere.  The Eargo 6 model is waterproof, it’s battery lasts all day long and it sounds amazing in all environments.  They are amazingly comfortable and because I wear them all the time the extended battery life means that my hearing aids can now keep up with me.  I also used the payment plan which allows for interest free payments for two years.  I liked my earlier Eargo model but I really do love these new ones."
8,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Device and charger fails within 2 years multiple times,"I bought the Eargo Neo in June 2020. Ever since its purchase, I had to replace the earpiece (both left and right) several times during warranty period. I also noticed that the charger was not functioning properly during this period. They refused to replace the charger saying the issue is with the earpiece and not the charger. Once the device is placed in the charger, all four lights would start blinking if it is not connected properly. Otherwise, depending on the charge level, one light blinks. It was a challenge to have this to work. Also, with their new app, it is impossible to connect the charger to the app to program the settings. The blue light during connection is permanently on even after completely draining the charger and recharging (see photo). Now, out of the warranty period, they are charging $279 to replace the charger. I was appalled to hear that the replacements are always refurbished. No wonder, I had to change the earpiece at least 5 or 6 times in the very first year.While having an earpiece that disappears in your ear with several program settings is a great idea, Eargo is not yet mature on their products. The quality control, obviously, is bad. Also, I have noticed that the customer service personnel need to be entertained to have them do anything for you. Fall for their jokes, innuendos etc.. For a product that costs $2000, I would discourage buying this product."
8,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"The full hearing aid goes inside of the ear, no external piece that can sits behind the ear.","I like the fact that they are pretty much hidden inside your ear and you don't have that external ear piece hanging behind your ear. There are 4 hearing modes that you can easily switch between, depending on the environment you are in. I still need to take more advantage of this feature. as i tend to forget about this feature and pretty much use one specific mode most of the time. It's easy to change modes by just tapping on the ears next to the hearing aid."
8,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great improvement to hearing aids,I upgraded recently to  the Eargo6. I am impressed with the improvement in sound quality and the ability to manage settings from your phone. I did find it took a couple of weeks to get used to the new fit but they’re like ‘second skin’ now.  Very happy to hear better.
8,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fantastic solution to my hearing issues.,"I like the natural sound it provides, that they are all  but invisible in my ear, they work for an entire day on a single charge, mobil app is great to adjust sound on the go, and they feel comfortable.  The support from Eargo has been great."
8,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Eargo 6 - Getting Closer to a Natural Hearing Experience,"My path towards solutions to hearing loss began with the Eargo Neo HiFi, the graduated to the Eargo 5, and now has culminated in the new Eargo 6. The Neo HiFi totally impressed me, and then the Eargo 5 completely blew me away. Hard to imagine anything better than the Eargo 5, but the Eargo 6 changed the game again.We, who suffer from various degrees of hearing loss would love to have the natural hearing capability of our youth back again. Hearing is dynamic, but many times hearing assist devices are not. Eargo 6 has now put me one step closer to that youthful, dynamic hearing experience with its sound adjust feature. Yes, you can still store four hearing profiles in its four program areas and change them manually, but with the hearing assist feature turned on the Eargo 6 device determines what kind of environment you are in and automatically adjusts itself to drown out unwanted background noise and accentuate the part that I consider most important - the ability to hear and discern human speech in a variety of environments.I was recently at a quasi-busy restaurant, seated at a booth against a wall. My left ear was facing the establishment's seating tables and my right ear was facing the wall. Within a few moments I could tell that the background noise suppression in my left ear was greater than in my right ear. I could hear and understand the person across from me very clearly. There was no need for me to tap my ears and change from the NORMAL program to the RESTAURANT program as I would typically have to do with previous versions of the Eargo devices. At the conclusion of the meal and after stepping outside, I could tell the dynamics were changing again since the background noise outside was much more quiet than inside the restaurant.This, to me, represents an amazing evolution in hearing assist technology. Hearing is much more natural now and the less I have to manually change settings in my devices the more I forget I even have them in. I also love the fact the no one knows I am wearing hearing aids as they are completely immersed in my ear canal.Eargo 6 is an amazing technology and one I'm grateful for. We often hear that quality of life is so very important. Proper hearing is an important component and Eargo 6 has clearly improved the quality of my hearing life which, in turn, enhances the overall quality of my life. Thank you Eargo. Can't wait to see where you take us next."
8,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Total amazing hearing aids,The hearing aids help me hear the things I have been missing. I never knew I was miss all these sounds until I bought Eargo. The app on phone is great you can control everything from your phone if you like. Customer service is amazing and they send you info to help you through the beginning of your new aids. Very easy to use the first time I had them in I was outside I stepped on a dry leaf and jumped a foot lol I never heard that sound before. Theses are cheaper then some of the other aids I was looking at and they will finance you as well you can’t go wrong with Eargo I am a happy camper.
8,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Comfortable to wear and near impossible to see!,"I have had the Eargo 6 now for about 2 months, and they are wonderful.  Great hearing devices that are very easy to insert and remove with a bit of practice.  Devices charge back up in about 2 hours and last all day.  Very easy to maintain and the Eargo customer service team is fabulous.  Eargo 6 is priced fairly and my health insurance covered the entire purchase!I would highly recommend Eargo 6 if you are in the market for hearing aids.Mark M."
8,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love my Eargos,Eargos are fantastic! The transition from over the ear to in ear couldn't have been easier. The sound match on the app made it so easy to get a great sound quality and if I need an adjustment for my surroundings the app works great. They're great for physical activity too. The background cancelling makes hearing in crowds much better.
8,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Happy with Eargo 6 hearing Aids,I bought Eargo from Eargo website directly and not on amazon. I have been using them for 3 months now. I am happy so far with my purchase for following reasons- Eargo are very small and cannot be easily seen by anyone. I have been searching for hearing aids that can be hidden in my ear and I'm glad I found eargo. I didn't like behind the ear hearing aids as I feel embarrassed as I don't like people seeing me wearing hearing aid. Eargo don't clog my ears much. My recommendation to eargo is continuing to further reduce the size of devices to make them even more tiny and further continue to improve technology. My experience with eargo 6 so far has been positive and I would definitely recommend them.
8,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very comfortable, hearing improved and helps with my tinnitus.","I have quit asking people to repeat themselves.  I didn't realize how much I read lips before.  Covid took that out as an option with everyone wearing masks.  That is when I became painfully aware of how much hearing loss I had.I'm embarrassed on my own at how much I have misunderstood in conversation.EARGOS are wonderful.  I forget I  have them in.  I knew I couldn't wear something over my ear.  So looking for hearing aids that fit in the canal was my only option.  I researched like crazy, but I wanted to make sure I purchased hearing aids that were good and approved.  They mask a great deal of my tinnitus also."
8,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best I have ever used,"I have tried other hearing aides and did not like them at all. The eargo was suggested by a friend, i have had mine since April of 2022 and love them.HIGHLY recommendThey work great in social settings, I do not use them when I am working in very dusty/noisy work situations.Absolutely no problems with them at all."
8,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Itching ears,My ears itch when I wear the ear buds.  I am not comfortable with that.  I like the charging base and the charging of the ear buds.
8,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Beware Complete JUNK,"I have had these for over a year now and am completely DISSATISFIED!!!  I've had issues with both buds and the charger from the first month. EARGO talks a good game when it comes to customer support and they will get back in touch with you EVENTUALLY. Believe me , I can find better things to spend a couple of thousand dollars on. I do have hearing loss and these work fairly well, WHEN they work. I'm completely fed up and moving to another brand. So please BEWARE!"
8,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Terrible quality and customer support,"I would have been better off flushing $2600 down the toilet. The charger in the first set of Eargo devices last 10 months. I was given replacement devices only to have the right hearing aid fail after 2 months of use. The customer service is terrible. After getting nowhere with phone calls, I started writing emails to have a paper trail. No one seems to read the emails. The left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing. After almost 2 months I still have no replacement for the second device. The company has an interim CEO right now and Eargo is expected to lay off 32-42% of its workforce in the next few months. PLEASE DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THESE TERRIBLE HEARING DEVICES!"
8,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Work better than other devices I've owned,"These hearing devices work better and are more easily adjusted than my previous hearing devices.  They took little time to get used to wearing them and they actually do adjust automatically to the noise in the environment.  They may not fit everyone's needs, but I am very pleased with them."
8,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Hasn't Ever Really Helped,"I was hoping Eargo 6 would help me understand people at restaurants, but it hasn't really made a difference.  Customer support recommends fixing the problem by doing more and more time consuming cleanings of my hearing aids--like that is the solution for everything. I was so hopeful, but, alas, I can not recommend this product."
8,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Easy to set up and use.,"Using the app, easily completed hearing test and adjusted aids to my profile.  Invisible and comfortable; easy to maintain.  A true breakthrough in hearing aid technology.  Having tried conventional hearing aids and found them uncomfortable and cumbersome, Eargo 6 was a great find."
8,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Save Your Money and Time!,"My wife has worn hearing aids for thirty years and has tried all styles. She liked the idea of programming the aides with her phone, but could never get the clarity and sound level that she needed. She liked the self- charging aspect, but it was unreliable. Three times in two weeks, the batteries didn't charge in their case and left her with no hearing aids for the day.  The audiologist that she worked with over the phone was very helpful and apologetic that the aids were not a good fit for my wife."
8,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Comfortable,"They fit great and we’re very comfortable to wear, just didn’t have enough volume for me"
8,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great hearing aids! They fit in your ears, and are so comfortable. Love them","I can hear! and no big things that go around your ears, and no outer ear hearing aids that fall off. These fit comfortably in my ears, and I can even forget they are there. Would recommend them to everyone!"
8,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,They are ok but not what I expected.,They are ok but not what I expected.
8,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,Stop working after 1 day,Left ear stopped working after 1 day. Volume control in the mobile app does not work. Support was of no help. Kept asking me if they were fully charged. Then said they would have someone contact me in ‘a day or so’. Worked really good initially. Returned.
8,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Horrible Customer Service,"Received the hearing aids, but had a problem with the initial charging. Called customer service and the customer service representative said she wasn't sure what to do. I asked for a supervisor and was told someone would call back in 24-48 hours. Through internet research I found the email of a senior executive who called back. He said I called during a ""busy time"" and that Eargo ""doesn't have unlimited resources."" Didn't offer to help solve the problem. Never heard back from a supervisor or anyone else. Not a great way to start, so returned the hearing aids the same day."
8,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Does not work well with Samsung phone.,"My app hardly worked and it was impossible to try and program and adjust the aids. When I spoke to a tech about the issue they stated that the Eargo product doesn't interface well with Samsung phones. They suggested trying to run a you tube video while using the app. Most of the time, 90% or so the devices simply would not recognize commands from the app. It would have been nice if the Eargo page would disclose the issues they have with working on Samsung phones. I was told they are working on it....I had high hopes."
8,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Terrible quality, didn't even last 3 months.","Save your money. These hearing aids are terrible. First off they amplify noises you don't have any interest in hearing loudly like the sound of a light switch flipping or water coming out of a faucet. You know what they don't amplify? Voices, you know the one sound you really do want to hear. On top of that one of them stopped charging after a couple months so now I can't even use them at all. Unbelievably terrible product."
8,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Hearing aids,"At 45 years old with moderate hearing loss I have tried several pairs of hearing aids and hearing enhancers. These were not great and actually at the bottom of the list out of the ones I tried.  To much whistling when they were in and found them not very comfortable.Most disappointing, even though it says it can be returned it took weeks upon weeks to get my money back and as you can see they aren’t cheap! Not worth the hassle and the return was the absolute worst experience I have had with Amazon."
8,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,"This is not what i thought it would be , i wish i could return it","Very uncomfortable in ear, inconsistant sound and constant feedback, and when my wife sneezes it blows my ears out. A novel idea, but i shouldn't have bought it"
8,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not going to be useful,First: They won't stay in. The large petals are too big (big guy here) and the 'medium' are a little too small. They move and itch like crazy and I don't trust them to stay in. They have a little less tinny sound than my $150 pair but it is always there. The phone app is pitiful and does very little.  The ear tap adjustments almost never work. I've been using cheaper devices for 4 years with the same sound amplification. I'm going to give them a few days but will probably return them.
8,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Outrageous amount of money for inexpensive parts!,"The company charges exorbitant prices for parts, and they recommend you replace those parts about every 2 months. There are some small aluminum caps that probably cost them 20 cents apiece, but you pay $40 for a pack of 6.  Same with Ear pieces. I cannot recommend them any longer. Same issues as a lot of other reviewer's, and in the end they just are not a good value."

8,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,EARGO Hearing Aids,"My hearing has been a problem for many years.  I didnt want to spend thousands of dollars just to hear clearly. Believe me I've been to other places for hearing aids.  In crowded noisy restaurants or parties I could never hear what someone was saying to me.  Now its much better.  I really found the EARGOs to work really well for me.  It takes a very little time to get use to it, but it has made my hearing so much better.  I hear things I never did before.  My family and friends speaking to me is clearer.  Watching TV is much better.  The people who work for EARGO are so very helpful and will answer any questions you have.  The techs will help you with any problem if you have one.  EARGO always sends you emails  updates when you need to clean your device etc. and other reasons.  You can call them anytime they are happy to help you.  I find that a very good features.  Easy care also with these.  I highly recommend them to anyone.  Thank you EARGO for giving me my hearing for lot less money.  Wishing EARGO many years of success.  Thank you Arlene D"
8,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Updated Review Eargo almost knocks it out of park.,"Small light and comfortable when you get them in place correctly. Practice Practice Practice. Sound quality is very good. Programs work well and can be adjusted slightly. I have had no issue with my Eargos  until I lost a removal pull some time around 5 months. I am unsure what happened or why but after a little back and forth with eargo they sent a new hearing aid in the mail.  So far I am very happy. Be careful of the mic caps, I lost one not sure how it was just gone when I removed at end of day. Solid hearing aid. If it had BT it would be a 5 star item. I had a behind the ear fitting a couple of years ago. Were they better, yes I think so but they had all the bells and wer 3k each, I only used them for an hour not much of a test. For over the counter these are pretty darn good. I now know how customers service is. They are good, very good in fact. Try them if you dont like them Amazons return policy makes it a no brainer. Please belive me I am 100% unbiased and have paid fully for my Eargos. If they were not all they claimed to be I would also tell that story. Good luck to all of you in your quest to hear better.Update. I have to say first that the Eargo 6 is a great benefit to my daily life. It helps me stay connected at work and home. My wife is much happier that she doesnt need to talk as loud or repeat things as often. The product itself has been good to great but as with all things, its not perfect. My charger died this week. After contacting Eargo they are replacing my entire unit since we cant tell if anything is funtioning right now leaving me without my hearing aids  for over a week and finding out only after the charger arrived if they worked at all wasnt an option with Eargo. Waiting on my replacements that should be here in a few days. If your on the fence try them out. The customer service I have received has been second to non. Thank you Lisa and Rhonda for you help you are the best.Next update: I just heard from my original customer care specialist, it seems he was away for a few months with health issues. When he got back he is checking in with his peeps to see if everything is still good or bad with my Eargos. More like having friends than just purchasing a hearing aid. So far no one and done here. Eargo has been standing behind their product."
8,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Terrible Disappointment,"It is hard to believe that I just purchased this last year, as one of the two earpieces has already stopped working – and this for the second time.  It was the left earpiece, which failed the first time in May of this year, less than a year after I purchased the product, but at that time the company replaced it.  I will not even be requesting a replacement this time, because of my general disappointment with how these things performed (or rather, underperformed).  I specifically bought them because my hearing loss is most acute in the higher frequency ranges – an impairment which, unfortunately, makes it particularly difficult to hear and understand conversations.  I occasionally give industry training presentations, and I would always dread taking questions, because I knew that I would have difficulty hearing them.  Eargo comes with an impressive array of app-supported bells and whistles which are supposed to help tailor the hearing experience to what one needs most, including volume control, assorted sound profiles, and suppression of extraneous noises, but I found that these were generally ineffective in helping me to hear the specific sounds that I needed and wanted to hear the most.  I remember sitting at a small round table after a morning conference, having lunch with colleagues.  The sound of plates being stacked several feet away from me was booming in my ears, while I could hardly hear what my colleagues were saying.  Customers are informed by the company that their ears will learn how to filter out extraneous noises that are amplified, but isn’t this just a tacit admission that Eargo is really little more than that – a basic sound amplifier?  A few months after purchasing the product, I started receiving e-mails from an Eargo customer service representative, encouraging me to write a review.  I told him that I was reluctant to do this, since I was only using the devices on those special occasions when I was in crowded rooms or events with several people.  When I made this response, I was probably using them once a month, or once a week at the most, and only a few hours at a time.  And still, I had one of the earpieces fail within a year’s time.  In August of this year, I took a job as a full-time college professor, and started using the earpieces during my classes, but again, this was only a few days a week, and a few hours at a time.  During that time, I became even more acutely aware of the product’s limited ability to help me hear questions from my students in the classroom.  And then, a few weeks ago, the left earpiece stopped working again, for the second time.  Even when both earpieces were working, I was annoyed by the fact that they have a tendency to move up into the ear canal, and I regularly found myself struggling (sometimes in a near panic mode) to get a hold of the tiny filament that would enable me to get the device out of my ear.  I really regret making such an expensive purchase, given how terribly it failed me.  The next time I go shopping for a hearing aid, I will do it under the guidance of a professional audiologist."
8,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,First time hearing aid user: Very happy with the Eargo's - Would recommend.,"I have been using the Eargo 6 hearing aids for over a month now and would recommend them.  Having developed a sudden loss of hearing in my right ear earlier in the year, I visited with an ENT doctor and they said I definitely needed hearing aids.  I tried (in the office) several different pairs of the over the ear style hearing aids.  Both pairs I tried were about $7000 (or around $5000 after my medical benefit).  Being in my early 50's I didn't want to be wearing a visible hearing aid and was interested in the over the counter (OTC) hearing aids that were just coming out.I happened upon several reviews on OTC hearing aids and the Eargo 6 kept being listed.  After reading about them and seeing a few reviews I decided to try them (as they had a no risk trial).  I got them and used the app to create a sound profile for me and liked the results.  After a few weeks of use, I met with one of the Eargo reps (Raquel) who took the time to walk me through the Eargo's, the app and answer any questions.  She also was able to program the Eargo's with my audiogram from my recent doctor's visit.  That was huge, as I was able to get professional calibration with an OTC device.  Any time I had questions, she/they were very responsive.  (If you're thinking about these - or other devices, I'd recommend getting a hearing exam..and then using this to calibrate the device....that made a huge difference in my experience.I find they make a big difference in what I can hear as well as help in loud crowd type situations.  I also am a huge fan of how hidden they are.  You cannot tell your wearing hearing aids unless someone focused on looking inside your ear.  They also come with different type/size ear pedals (which were important to figure out - and can help address issues seen with other reviews - for me at least).Pros:  Very comfortable, great quality sound, super responsive staff/support, almost invisible when I wear them, convenient charger, price (1/2 the price of most other devices I looked at),  2 year warrantyCons:  The application still needs some improvement (as it can't tell you the exact settings in your device…it's one way….pick a setting in the app…and it pushes it to your hearing aids).  But they have made several updates since I've had it and were open to suggestions when I mentioned it to support.  They also don't have Bluetooth  support for music (which I don't care about…but I know some might).  [The app concern and no bluetooth were not big deals for me but wanted to have a few cons to be ""fair"".]"
8,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,45-day free trial period is not available if you buy thru Amazon,"Bought these through Amazon for my husband. You do not get Eargo's 45-day free trial period when you buy them through Amazon. Amazon only gives you 30 days from the date purchased to return these, and, you lose another 5 days to shipping. My husband decided to keep these, but, before the 45 day period ran out, the Eargo 7s came to market. So, he was going to return the Eargo 6s and get the 7s. Although he was within Eargo's 45-day trial period, he was beyond Amazon's 30-day period (in reality, 25-day period). Neither Amazon or Eargo would budge. So, beware.  Also, Eargo recommends replacing the silicone tips and mic covers every two months. $40 or so per set of silicone tips. Another $15 or so for the mic caps. You can't get those on Amazon and I haven't found any generics any where. And, Eargo does not advertise this when it is trying to sell you the hearing aids. So, these devices are pricy and continue to cost $240 + per year.As for the hearings aids, they help, but they are not perfect.  Eargo's over the phone help is really good, though, and the folks on the phone don't sugar coat things. My husband complained that his tinnitus seems to have become more intense since starting to wear the devices. He expected that with improved hearing, the tinnitus would be better masked. The audiologist from Eargo told him, unfortunately, he is in the minority of users that experience this. She says most do get some relief though.  The unnatural echo-y sound he hears when he talks has diminished somewhat after 2 months, but not entirely. However, the high pitched dings and beeps still sound like whistles rather than single tones. The audiologist says he'll get used to it.  He still complains about it to me.The devices help somewhat. I still have to repeat myself more often than I like, but, at least it is not every conversation.Because Eargo maintains control over the software that runs these devices, he has to call to get the different pre-programmed settings modified beyond the limited amount of adjustment given to the user. Thus, he mostly keeps the settings on ""Normal.""  The pre-programmed settings for other situations do not seem to be very helpful.Overall, he is wearing them. Just don't expect miracles."
8,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,This hearing aid is an engineering marvel at half the cost of my previous hearing aids!,I have been using these aids since mid November and Initially I was concerned because the aids arrived with the microphone caps missing. I placed a call to Eargo and was pleased that 1 day later a package of caps arrived via FedX.I have always been uncomfortable taking hearing tests by an Audiologist so these aids were a perfect choice for me. The self administered test via the Eargo app was a series of tones at various level that I would acknowledge hearing or not hearing. This is very similar to what I had experienced in the past at an Audiologist office. I understand that Eargo will work with an audiogram however and configure your aids if that is what you would prefer.The sound from these aids is superior to what I have experienced over the past 15 years wearing clunky and expensive behind the ear aids that were somewhat intrusive because I wear glasses. I actually forget that I'm wearing the Eargo6 aids.At some point I thought I had a problem with the right hearing aid because the voice that announces the various programs had become very soft. I called Eargo and left a message for them to call back. Unfortunately I was not available when they called but in a follow up e-mail they suggested going through their trouble shooting once more and perform a vigorous cleaning of the receiver and speaker area. Up to then I was being very cautious when cleaning because of the small size of these aids. They are actually quite rugged so I proceeded to remove the cap and petals and vigorously cleaned both the microphone and speaker and the problem was solved. Apparently even a microscopic amount of wax in the wrong place can disable the aids because the openings are so small.I've read other reviews that said there was an issue with the app on certain phones but since the recent program upgrade the app is working great with my Samsung A25 phone even in a noisy environment.After all is said and done I believe these aids represent the future and based on Eargo's mission will continue to evolve to provide continuing support for improved hearing.
8,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Only Work for a Short Time,"This product was originally easy to set up and worked fine for about a week. Then the charger could not recognize that the hearing aids had been re-inserted, and would not charge. After following customer service as advice to clean the hearing aids, which did not fix the problem, I followed their instructions to Reset the hearing aids and reconnect to my phone. Because the charger would not recognize the hearing aids as having been inserted, the phone would never connect. With all the time that I spent with customer service and trying to get everything to connect, ultimately, it would’ve been easier to go to an audiologist and  pay the same amount and get real time support."
8,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointing,"I'm sure that Eargo is quite proud of their development with the Eargo line of hearing aids, particularly the Eargo 6, which I purchased.  They have indeed been able to engineer a great amount of technology into a tiny package, about the size of a bumble bee.  One can tell that much thought has gone into the design, not only of the hearing aids, but of the charger package, and that very portable charging container is a delight to use.  (And of course it is even remarkable that hearing aids of this tiny size have been made rechargeable.)  Furthermore, Eargo has developed an app which can customize the frequency response and operational modes of the hearing aids.  No doubt Eargo is seeing all this from a design point of view and is patting itself on the back.  And that's a well-deserved pat.However, I have to approach using hearing aids from an end-user point of view.  They're the designer; I'm the user.  And at every turn since I've had them (for two weeks now), I have been disappointed.  Although they do amplify sounds, and have thus made speech and TV much more intelligible to me, using them has proved to be an irritant for me.  Strangely, many of the things which bother me, they have listed in their user manual as things you will have to get used to.For one thing, I cannot wear them for more than an hour or two before my ears itch to the point where I have to remove them and scratch.  Supposedly this will get better over time, but how would I really know that?Secondly, another thing that they warn you of is that you will hear your own voice louder than you would without the Eargos in place.  That has proved to be a show-stopper for me.  I have worn them in the classroom when I teach, and I am told that when the Eargos are in, I talk way too softly and my voice does not carry to the back of the room.  With my own voice blaring in my ears, I cannot gauge my actual speaking volume. I have never had that complaint before in my decades of teaching -- until the Eargos went in.Twice in the two weeks I've had them, despite my taking the utmost care in being gentle with the hearing aids, the removable circular ""mic cap"" (which constitutes the bottom end of each hearing aid) has come off.  Once it came off on the ground, but today it came off in my ear, and had to be removed by a hearing professional.  In addition to the professional removal fee, replacing those caps is an expensive proposition.  Eargo charges $40 for a package containing three pairs of mic caps.  That constitutes an ongoing expense at a rate which I consider intentionally excessive, in view of the fact that a fraction of a cent worth of plastic constitutes each one.  It is also a design flaw that a component of the hearing aid can fall off into your ear.Another time, one of the Eargos fell out of my ear onto the ground.  That's a nasty feeling when something for which you've paid almost $3000 could ""lose itself"" almost without your knowing it.A more minor irritation is in using the app to switch listening modes while in a noisy environment.  For example, the Eargos start in ""Normal mode"", but if I want to use the app to switch them to ""Restaurant mode"" while in a noisy restaurant, that doesn't work reliably.I could go on, but I imagine that by this point, you get the idea.  The Eargo coin has two sides.  On the one hand you have a marvel of 21st-century engineering; on the other hand, this is a product whose use leaves me feeling as though I have just finished watching a B-movie.  It leaves me searching for the main attraction."
8,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Defective product delayed refund,"This is my first hearing aid. When I first received, I was excited and went through all of the instructions and videos to set up my hearing aids. I initially only heard audio cues in my left hearing aid while hearing some improvement in my overall hearing. After using a couple of days, I realized the right hearing aid wasn't working and any enhanced hearing was coming from my left side. I then spent about 10 days with three different Customer Support people troubleshooting various items from their checklist, with each item taking 1-2 days to complete - thorough cleaning of the ear pieces and recharge (no change), unplug and deplete the batteries - then recharge (no change), thorough cleaning of charging station - then recharge (no change), switch sides while charging hearing aids (right hearing aid worked for 1 hour), Switch sides again and recharge (right side still didn't work). Finally, after two weeks of working with Customer Support, EARGO said they would send me a replacement for the right hearing aid. It then took over two weeks for me to receive my replacement because of EARGO shipping delays.With a working set, I tried the hearing aids in different hearing environments and decided that the benefits of the EARGO hearing aids were not worth the discomfort, effort, and cost. So, I decided to return and get a refund. When I went to the Amazon site to do a return, it said the return window had expired (30 days) which surprised me because the NYT Wirecutter review said EARGO had a 45-day return window. When I contacted EARGO directly about this, they said they could not do anything because Amazon was the seller.Update: After this review went up, I was given a refund. I raised my rating from 1 star to 3 stars."
8,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,That is what I was looking for,"I was reluctant about the price of the Eargo 7 so I tried several options with a lower cost and similar sizes. One by one they ended up disappointing, some of them I returned immediately after trying because they were really bad. So I ended up with this one and have been with it for about two months. It is small, discrete and the sound is great. I also called the support and they were very helpful and developed a customized program that really made a difference. So far, great product, all I was looking for."
8,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Quality of the Product/Accessabilty of Support,"Greetings;I want to thank you for reaching out to inquire about my experience with my recent purchase of the Eargo 6 system from Amazon.  The most positive comment I can offer is the hearing devices have met all of my expectations from the simplicity of operation to the in-ear design.  This is my first experience with any type of hearing device.  I’m glad I chose Eargo.Being a comparatively complex health-aid, where a person may have expectations that may greatly exceed the capabilities the device can deliver, may be somewhat disappointed. However, if they invest in a minimal amount of research, they could eliminate a lot of their frustration.  When I invested in the Eargo 6, I did not expect absolute hearing perfection.  My expectation was improvement in a medium loss of hearing in some ranges.  The Eargo 6 met that expectation perfectly.My opinion is; if most folks recognize they are not visiting a fully equipped Audiologist’s practice that is filled with all of the most modern equipment that can be tailored to their hearing situation, and they have researched the “pro’s and con’s” of online purchasing and its limitations, they will find they will be very satisfied with the line of Eargo products.A couple of other comments:  I was very pleased with Eargo’s approach in working with the new customer.  The constant contact approach helped eliminate much of the apprehension in adjusting to the new world of assisted hearing.  The introduction of meeting telephonically with one of Eargo’s audiologists offered valuable insight in key device adjustments and helped relieve any insecurity that may have developed during the initial phases of starting with Eargo.  All in all it has been a very positive long distance learning experience.  I never felt I was left alone to figure it out for myself.  Much could be learned from Eargo’s customer support model."
21,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not ready for prime time,"Was very excited to get these as they have blue tooth, BUT blue tooth is very inconsistent. Also have to try to reconnect for every use, maddening!.  Sound quality is much worse than that of my Iphone 7.  I would suspect quality control and programming issues."
21,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great hearing aid,This is a great lower cost over-the-counter hearing. I have many times more for prescription hearing aides that don’t work nearly as well for me. Plenty of volume and configure ability for me and comes with Bluetooth and recharge ability.
21,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,First time user of hearing aids,Was able to hear things I haven't heard on years. The only thing that I have had any trouble with is connecting to phone to stream radio and answer calls from phone hopefully will resolve with tech support
21,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Battery life.,I really like the performance of these heating aids but the batteries are not holding much of a charge after 45 days of use. Does anyone know where I can buy replacement batteries?
21,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Start hearing what you been missing,","First off I would like to say I have been looking for a quality device that would allow me to hear everything and everyone again like I did when I was younger. Well mission accomplished.Have had my Engage hearing device powered by Lucid for around 6 weeks now and they have definitely checked all the boxes. Comfortable, Easy to use, Discreet and sound quality is fantastic, no back noise and squealing like I experienced with a few other brands I purchased in past. Retuned all others. That won’t be the case with these. Having my hearing restored has allowed me to enjoy a lot of life That I been missing. Going to my grandchildren’s wrestling meets and being able to actually hear everything in clarity and comfort and not all garbled together and no range is something I’m enjoying since I purchased engage.  Hope they continue to perform at this level for along time.  Priceless!!"
21,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good product with a very handy charger.,"I bought this product for my father. He has been using them for about a week now, and he is really enjoying them. It took a couple of days for him to adjust, but I have noticed a big improvement. They also come with a handy charging case that can be carried around for on the go charging."
21,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Not a lot of experience, but they make a difference","These are the first real hearing aids I've gotten,so I have a limited perspective.They seem well designed and come with a handy case that can recharge them several times. Included is all the stuff you need to get started, things to clean the unit and maintain it, so good thought process there.The units themselves are very small and unobtrusive, fitting snuggly behind the ears, Took a few tries to get theearpxiece to fir but I expected that.In use the controls are simple, perhaps too simple compare with other units I've seen from friends. The Lucid app only has a three star rating.In use? They bring out the high end sounds I have dropped as I got older very nicely, they do make quite a difference once you get them adjusted to your preference, I ended up using the open ear pieces, you hear your voice better and it sounds more natural. You lose sound quality if you stream music via Bluetooth with them but I don't intend to do that, the fidelity is limited, as you might guess.So far so good, Lucid does have the option of going to a Sam's club where they have people who can help you set them up. Sadly, none near me."
21,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Absolutely Awesome,"I didn't purchase mine thru Amazon; the Lucid Engage store just happened to be offering a discount so I saved about $100, but even at $999, these are still a bargain.  I have moderate hearing loss (too many years working around sawmills and heavy machinery in my younger years).  I was tested by an audiologist a year ago but just couldn't stomach spending nearly $9000 on a set of hearing aids.  The Lucid Engage hearing aids for about 8 grand less give me almost all of the abilities of the set I tried from the audiologist other than some IFTT functionality.I received these quickly, took a couple of hours to charge them, put them in my ears and instantly improved my hearing.  People that I work with have noticed that I'm not asking them to repeat themselves.  They're comfortable - I immediately went to wearing them 10-12 hours a day and they work for phone conversations/ bluetooth to my phone.I use these with the iPhone app and it works pretty good.  It occasionally loses connectivity but so far sticking them in the  charging case and taking them back out in a minute or two seems to solve the problem.All in all, recommended."
21,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Sorry no streaming,"My Phonak rechargeable hearing aids had to to in for service. Unfortunately that's 2-3, and sometimes longer.  (I've used Phonak hearing aids for a decade.) So I decided I pick up some OTC hearing aid for these type of emergencies.  At a large wholesale club I was shown the Lucid Engage. I was only asked one question, was my phone an iphone or android, based on that they handed my a box.Getting them going was easy and the sound was fine. This was great. Then I received a call and rather than a tone in my ear there was ringing in my pants pocket. I couldn't take the call through the hearing aids. In fact I couldn't stream anything through them. What a disappointment!!! I called tech support and basically it came down to ""too bad so sad.""  There was nothing on the packaging about this.Disappointed."
21,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Which do you want, technology, or simplicity?","These hearing aids are absolutely amazing... for the right person.  They are loaded with technology, and even let you listen to music through them, but there is definitely a learning curve if you want to get the most out of these hearing aids.  A younger person would probably be really excited about these, as the app allows so much customization.  An older person, on the other hand, may benefit from a more simple device.Pros:- They are are discrete when wearing, and comfortable.- Has 4 different programs - Mild, Moderate, Bass Boost and Max (max is Bass Boost + max volume)- Noise reduction works great - You can also change the volume of steaming music, with noise reduction, so you can use the hearing aids while listening to music.- Has manual buttons as well- Fully charges in 4-5 hoursCons:- Can be overly complicated to set up- Requires you to manually set up, instead of having a professional set up, so you may undercut yourself if you don't set it up correctly."
21,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Extremely powerful, yet almost invisible","Lucid hearing engage aid is like a tiny amazing robot that seems to do things beyond making things louder. My elderly has been losing hearing over time, and in uneven way, like certain noises sound like screeching painful but voices are muffled and not comprehended. It’s almost like a range or frequency problem but he has been against looking like “old” person with hearing aids. The Lucid hearing aid is almost invisible, with a lightweight box that completely hides behind the ear and almost clear and thin plastic piece in the front that holds the ear plug inside the ear, which is also tiny that you can’t really see it. This, he finally accepted and it’s been like magic. He can hear clearly, even with just one on, that those of us who got used to having to shout at the top of our lungs had trouble adjusting to talking in normal talking voices to him. The weird amplified side noises went away and he doesn’t complain about them. It connects to his android phone, and you can use as little or as much of the fancy functions as needed, which makes it good for tech savvy/not savvy/young/older. The case is sturdy and fit as a housing for the tiny robot. The outer box is beautiful, like a high end gift, nothing like a medical equipment for elderly. The price has actually gone down since I last checked this item, making it more affordable. This would be an awesome Christmas gift for those who need a wide range of auditory assistance."
21,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Was very happy with aids until,...","Lucid will not repair any of their devices after five years of service. If less than five years and out of warranty, you are given a flat repair fee of $400.00 without questioning what is wrong with the aid(s). Could be just a cleaning,... they don't care.Not budget friendly no matter how long you have been a loyal customer."
21,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very Pleased,"Only had them two days but I'm very impressed.  Sync'd with my Pixel 6 Pro with one small glitch.  Seemed to get stuck with the rotating circle on ""Welcome to Lucid Hearing"" page.  Closed and reopened the app and tested all features OK.  Box says Present not Lucid but the charger case does say Lucid.  Product must have been sold.  Used them in a noisy bar and could hear OK.  The charger case is a nice feature.  My previous aids were expensive ($5K) Siemens and failed after 5 years.  Only thing I miss is the directional feature.  My voice sounds loud in the aids but I'll get used to it. Best I have found for the money.5/22 - Well had them for awhile now.  I don't get anywhere near the 22 hr. they spec.ed.  Sometimes they start warning low battery after a few hours.  I'm not sure why.  I have alternated the charging slots and no difference.  Have started opening an closing the battery door every morning to see if that helped but no change.  A lady with a purse would have no problem carrying the charger box but it's a lot in a man's pocket.  I still think they are a great deal for the money.7/24 Still pleased.  Batteries now need recharge after aboout 8 hr..  I charge them over night then swap their slots while I make the bed.  Usually done by the time I finish the bed.  Sometomes last from 8 to 8.  App disapears sometimes but reconnects when I click the icon.  As mentioned by others the do not retain their settings so I reset them as necessary.  Generally a great help."
21,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Engage Appreciation,"I had my hearing tested a couple of years and the audiologist confirmed a hearing loss.  I was programmed with a pair of hearing aids that worked great but cost $5,000 so I decided to just live with the loss.I recently tried the Engage product as the price was much more reasonable.  They have been absolutely life changing!  The startup was simple and straightforward and within minutes of unboxing the product, it became clear to me all that I had been missing.  I take extreme joy every single day in hearing things that otherwise would have gone unnoticed and not having to constantly ask people to repeat themselves in conversation.Thank you and well done Engage Team on a great product!"
21,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,,No sirve
21,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Easy to use,"This hearing aid is easy to put on, easy to charge and easy to clean. I like how you can control the hearing aid with your phone. This hearing aid feels solid, good quality."
21,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Won’t hold a full charge,Reallly comfortable and love that they Bluetooth with my iPhone. But I returned them because the right hearing aid would not stay charged.
21,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,The left battery wouldn't hold a charge,I thought the hearing aids were very comfortable. The downside was the left battery would not hold a charge for more than 6-7 hours and people would comment that it sounded like an AM radio station with static and an annoying clicking noise even after I tried doing sound adjustments. I returned them after having them for less than a week.
21,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,An investment in Relationships,"I have had some hearing issues for 30 years.  Conversations have been challenging and not so much for me, but my family obviously did not enjoy the continual ""What did you say?""  I decided to wait until some bluetooth, cell phone interactive devices came along.  Here they are, and without the expense of an audiologist visit.I prefer the vented tips as it allows a more natural sound that is not overpowering.  Thank you!"
21,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent hearing aids,"For the price, excellent quality. My first hearing aids were $6000. They lasted  9 years, but each had to be rebuilt twice at $600 a pop. These Engage hearing aids have better audio quality, are rechargeable (no more batteries!!) and work flawlessly with my IPhone. If they last, it will be the best investment I have made for my health."
21,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Very Disappointed,"After reading the highlights of the Lucid Engage hearing aid I decided this was the one for me.. ""NOT"", All types of malfunctions.  Continuous whistling in my ears, one minute they're on then automatically turn off or vice-versa.  App works, then it don't work.  Some serious adjustments is needed to make this hearing aid work as indicated.  So sad- I  thought I found a good product. ""NOT"". IT'S TERRIBLE"
21,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Tinny and lost connection every 30 seconds,"I purchased these and quickly returned them.  Perhaps, I received a pair that was faulty.  The sound quality didn’t seem good to me; sounds had a tinniness and the volume fluctuated on its own.  I tried to connect them to my iPhone to listen to a podcast, and they couldn’t maintain a connection,If someone needs simple hearing aids that amplify volume and modulate surrounding noise, I think a pair of these that doesn’t have the glitches I had would be just fine,"
21,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent product!!!,These hearing aids are the best I've had. Compatibility with iPhone was important as was rechargeable. These fulfill that on both fronts. The functionality is the biggest feature. My hearing hasn't been this good in several years. Well worth the cost.
21,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Size large adjustable but you have to buy the smaller size tubes,The tubes are for large ears and were too long for mine. It says to just call customer service and they can get you a smaller size. The tubes cost $75.00 each so plan to spend $150.00 more of they don’t fit. I sent them back.
21,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,A Rip-off?,"I bought a pair a few months ago, and I lost one of them (these devices are easy to lose, especially if you wear a mask), and I wanted to buy one, but I was told by a representative that I have to buy the two. Isn't this a rip-off? I will not deal with Lucid again."
21,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best I’ve tried without paying a fortune,"My hearing loss made it difficult to understand some speech, especially on different tv programs.These hearing aids are working for me, best ones I’ve tried under a $1,000. I’ve tried more expensive ones and sent them back. These ones are keepers.Thank you Lucid for the Engage hearing aides."
21,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Buyer Beware,"The app does not work for anything other than adjusting the volume. What a joke, an expensive joke. No one from Lucid seems to know how to get the blue tooth to actually work. Not to mention as soon as you get them you have to send them to Lucid for an update. I'll be getting a refund."
21,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,We couldn't get them to setup to the level my husband needs.,Tiny ear covers too awkward and didn't stay on.  Couldn't get levels to setup to the volumn my husband needed.
21,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Not enough volume for mother.,"We wanted to try these and they just don't have enough power for my 94 year old mother. We were hoping for this to work, but unfortunately her hearing is so bad we couldn't use them.If you have SEVERE hearing loss, these probably won't work to well...."
21,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent product, I recommend them hands down!","What can I say other then, they work great. Had another Lucid hearing aid I paid $940.00 for a single aid and the pair I purchased here work just as good if not better because the app allows you to change the hearing tones to your needs in any environment as needed."
21,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fantastic,"These hearings aids are a blessing,I charged them up and connected to my blue tooth. The first time I went outside I could hear the birds singing, and all the sounds I had lost and never realized it. The difference is like night and day, I couldn’t be happier"
21,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Still learning & experimenting.,"While I am still learning how to use my hearing aids, I am pleased so far. I have had aids from $4500 to $160, and this is my 5th set in 15 years. I love that I don’t have to buy batteries, comfort and easy to clean."
21,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wow!,This works for me!  You have to get used to settings first.  Then get bluetooth receiver for TV so it streams directly to HA.  Can't wait for that.
21,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Do not work as advertised,Actually after replacing the original pair with a second pair thinking I had a bad pair .................NO they do not stay connected to the app or iPhone 12 for either the hearing aid function or Bluetooth.  Both pair are extremely aggravating to use and totally useless.
21,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent Hearing Aids,I have had another set of hearing aids from a different manufacturer for the past two years.  I have decided and try another manufacturer and what a difference!  I am very pleased in my first two weeks.
21,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,Lucid hearing engage very disappointed with cost expected better quality,Not a hearing aid with options.. more just an amplifier..not happy at all
21,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,More than what I expected,"When I finally decided to consider hearing aids, I tried two different audiologists in the area, and tried their top of the line hearing aids. With one, everything lagged, creating an echo effect. With the second, they tried a ""bait and switch"" that I won't tolerate.These hearing aids, costing about 10% of what these big name devices run, do what I had hoped. And I received more. I had some questions about them and several times contacted their Tech Support group through their website. They have quickly (same day responses) answered my questions, and gave me helpful tips to make them work at peak performance the Lucid software for my phone allows me to make a lot of adjustments, stream audio, take phone calls, and even get notifications and text messages.Very pleased with the product and with the support.Highly recommend!"
21,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Finally, something that works!","Being a young hard of hearing person is always such a struggle, that’s why I am so grateful for engage. My favorite feature is the streaming function. I can turn it on all the way to streaming and not pick up any ambient noise and just fully hear my music when working out or just sitting at my desk grading papers. 10 out of 10 for me!"
21,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Life Changing,"I have had hearing loss since I was 18 years old and was always hesitant to get hearing aides. I finally decided I needed to get some so that I could stop saying ""excuse me"" or ""what"" every time someone spoke to me.  I received my Engage hearing aides and once I charged them I put them in and immediately heard sounds I have not heard in years!  The wind rustling, BIRDS CHIRPING, the ceiling fan etc.  My husband was able to speak to me from across the room and I heard everything he said.  These are truly life changing and so easy to use.  I can set the volume higher or lower from my Iphone and change settings.  I am not one to usually write reviews but these are so amazing I highly recommend them to anyone that has even the slightest hearing loss."
21,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Discrete aids with clear sound.,These are really great hearing aids. They have a very discrete design which is also very comfortable and lightweight. The sound produced is very clear. These hearing aids work well with android devices. Definitely worth the price!
21,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you want an A-1 product, easy to use, and affordable, these are the ones for you!","I’m in my 80s and noticed my hearing was getting less and less.  A very good friend recommended the Lucid hearing aid partly because of the quality of the product, the ease of using, and the knowledge of the representative explaining everything.  She was very thorough and readily answered all my questions.  I’m very pleased with my hearing aids and look forward to better hearing ahead."
21,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love the hearing aid,Great hearing aid
21,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"After weeks of research, I went with these...","As you can see in the picture, the Lucid Engage hearing aids are almost invisible. They are very comfortable and I felt the sound was excellent from the minue I put them in two days ago.  This AM I reached out to customer support online and after a few minutes I learned a whole lot more about customizing the experience with my Lucid app on my iPhone.  Pairing them with your iPhone is a snap as long as you follow the insuructions! I am very happy with this purchase and I saved thousands over whet Medicare was offering me for lower tech hearing aids. I receive all of my cell phone calls directly through my hearing aids and I can stream music too but that sound cannot compare to what I can hear through my Apple Ear Pods but that is to be expected.  My last comment is that they are extremely comfortable!"
21,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazingly good!,"I've only had these for one day, but the difference between these and my last pair is evident.  The sound, across the entire spectrum, is much clearer.  And it passes bass sounds, something no other aids have done for me.  I had trouble setting up the bluetooth for iPhone control, and a very nice person got me through it quickly.  The instructions provided with the aids for bluetooth connection could be a bit more extensive, but hey, I got it done.  I would highly recommend these aids."
21,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing Hearing Aids,"These were a huge surprise.  High quality all around.  Lightweight, comfortable, rechargeable, accurate reproduction of sound.  Quick and easy setup with the app.  Makes calls, streams music, and connects to my tv and lets me set my own volume while everyone else hears the speakers at a lower volume."
21,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Equal to, or better, than $4000 Signia charge and go aids.","Remarkable deal and high quality.  Many adjustments for comfort, long change, recharge in case when traveling, Quality made and small.  Great support and customer service, and beautifully packaged.  I am really surprised at the quality as I was hesitant to buy these.  I have no criticisms about these aids.  Fully adjustable manually or with the excellent app they provide.  Amazing deal at $800 for the pair.  As you can tell, I'm more than satisfied."
21,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Really like them,"I am not new to hearing aids, but this is the first OTC pair I have bought.  They stream phone calls and audio via Bluetooth and stream to both ears.  The app is easy to use and lets you fine tune to your hearing.  Sound quality is good.  Love that the charging case charges as well as the aids themselves.  Makes it easy to charge on the go.  Only thing I would have liked to see with these is a hearing test in the app to help with fine tuning each program for your specific hearing needs.  Overall great little hearing aids that I would highly recommend."
21,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,After 3 years..,"After 3 years of flawless daily use and probably 400 + hrs of watching movies and listening to music via the bluetooth. I bought a second pair to use daily and my older,trusty pair i sat aside so i have a "" back up"" pair. I cant say enough about what a great deal these hearing aids are."
21,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Satisfactory,"These are pretty nice for the price. On occasion, one may die early, but generally, the charge lasts a full day. I tried using the app to set them up, but it seems that if you go out of range, they revert to their power-up state. So I just use them manually. There are 4 'programs' built in and the Moderate setting does me just fine."
21,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love them!,"I have purchased hearing aids for thousands of dollars years ago. I have to admit that these are the closest I found to them.  The are not amplifiers but give a good balance.  Also, the iPhone app is great because I was used to that with my expensive aids.  This is a good purchase.  So far so good!"
21,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,I can hear again!,"As soon as I took my evening walk with my dog, I could hear the crickets,  the water running in the creek, and the leaves rustling in the woods among others nature sounds that I had forgotten about.  They also work well when my wife talks, and even in a group setting in a restaurant.They only wish is that the speaker was a little smaller, as it is taking a while to get use to these being in my ear."
21,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Could not sync to my phone, terrible support","My android phone was unable to see the hearing aids, no matter what I tried - airplane mode and back, reboots, tried an older phone, power cycling the hearing aids through disconnection of the battery, all to no avail.They work, technically, as-is, but are functionally useless as they cannot be adjusted and the volume rockers don't seem to change anything.I tried to reach their support multiple times; the chat feature is worthless, no one ever comes on, and when I tried the phone no one ever picked up the call from hold and it eventually hung itself up.Do not recommend."
21,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Very nice sound,Very nice hearing aids. The sound quality is good.  I like that they are Bluetooth compatible with my android.  I did have to up grade my phone though.  I have a 9 operating system and it requires a 10 minimum.  I called customer service and a very helpful representative was able to tell me which phones were compatible. I was disappointed that the app to adjust the hearing aids wouldn't download.  Otherwise a great product
21,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,The right unit never worked.,i wrote to the company and never heard back.  This is the first time I noticed there is a place to complain. I would like a replacement ordere
21,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,#TEAMANDROID,I'm really disappointed because I needed to get the hearing aid program and when I finally found a place to do it I'm told its not compatible.  I ordered for a android and I was sent for an iPhone. had no idea till we couldn't connect to my phone! now it's too late to return.
21,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Batteries don’t last long,The batteries do not last longThe charge does not last longNot worth the price
21,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,fades in and out,both the hearing and Bluetooth fades in and out but when working they are great
21,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Lucidshape app and OTE hearing aids,The lucidshape app enables user to program the hearing aids for your specific hearing frequency deficiency. They are awesome!I was able to set them up better then the past audiologists ever did in the past. Also there customer support is staffed by experts in the U.S. who take the time to LISTEN to customer issues. Louis is a great support person. Thanks Lucid for providing a cost effective solution to my hearing loss.
21,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not worse the money,Got them and 6 month into it and the right went dead tried to get tech support but with no avail not recommend them.
21,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good hearing aids,"Light weight forgot that I was wearing these and got into the shower! They have Incredible sound quality!  compared these to a $6,000 pair which you can program on deflaut the lucid engage have to manually but for differents in price clear sound you can't beat these lucid engage aids 3 months now daily use and haven't had any problems. Just a little bit with app issue but was quickly resolved by the tech who was very nice to work with never had to wait on calls, also bluetooth music phone calls works great.I'll update in couple months"
21,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,No customer service,"This is not a blue tooth hearing aid combo, the application does not have the controls promised in the description, very poor app design.Customer service never answer the phone, and they never call back.I use it as a regular hearing aid, I like the rechargeable battery feature, and battery life, do not expect anything else."
21,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Plain old junk,"After returning a pair because of major feedback, and yes like others here it took WEEKS to get my refund I purchased these. At firs I was on the fence as for their performance, but now I can attest they are junk undoubtedly  manufactured far from American shores. The charger was glitchy in that sometimes it worked and other times it would not. I contacted Lucid and they promised a replacement 2-day shipping. That was over a week ago. I have not received a replacement. This morning the right aid took a dump. The volume control would not work. The early OTC hearing aid rule is failing badly in it's early stage. Spend the extra money and purchase a reputable hearing aid. I sent them back to Amazon. Let's see how long it takes to get a refund this time."
21,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good value and quality,"Extremely comfortable, great charging  with auto shut off, ability to turn off so not to drain charge between charges. Very good hearing aid, unfortunately, I have severe hearing loss and I need something more. I have tried several aids, from several thousand dollars. This is well thought out and should work great for mild to moderate hearing loss."
21,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Second attempt worse than the first,"I sent one set of these back because one channel would not connect. Engage tech support advised me to return them. Because of the failure to connect, I never got to the app.Bottom line: The app is [rhymes with ""app""].I have one of the phones listed for compatibility. The issue might be with Android 12. In any event, without a working app these things are utterly useless. Nevertheless I did try them and the result was unacceptable. Background noise like my dishwasher or A/C was far more prominent than sounds coming from my A/V receiver in spite of the fact that the receiver was louder and far closer.BTW, tech support is handled by Sam's Club. I suspect that Lucid licensed the Engage aids to Walmart. If you try the app in demo mode it is completely different than when connected to the Engage aids. The menus and choices are entirely different.Call me a cynic but I have some serious misgivings about the validity of ratings and reviews for this product."
21,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,DOESN’T HOLD CHARGE ! DON’T WASTE YOUR MONEY!,Seriously!I bought this march 24 2022. Todays review is Dec 4 2022. I Charge over night and by 3 pm they are dead.Needless to say very inconvenient as I am Doctors offices for business all day. They all have glass windows with a little  slot. I can’t hear them.Options1) I quit working at 3 pm.2) Engage actually stands behind their product .3) Spend more money and buy  a quality product from a company that stands behind their product.This old adage rings true .Something that costs less in the beginning costs more  in the long run.(8 months is evidently a long time .)
21,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,I did not realize how much I was unable to hear until now,"These are very easy to use.  Convenient charging case.  They are very small and discreet.  They are so comfortable, I forget I have them in.  I did not realize how much I was missing when others spoke.  Now I can understand what everyone else is saying."
21,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best OTC hearing aid available,"I did not expect to use these except for social events. I now wear them all the time. I didn’t realize what I had been missing with bad hearing! I now see that I was ignoring what little sound registered in my brain because it conveyed less and less helpful info. I can see how this could push you down the slippery slope to senility.  The noise reduction is excellent, I can be in a noisy place and understand conversations all around me. I can drive with the window open listening to the car radio with less annoyance than when I was young with good hearing.  I can go to a bar and play a YouTube video and still hear conversations or change the settings to ignore the idiots.  Downside:  You have to understand the limitations of Bluetooth connections stay the same as with your earbuds, it’s not the hearing aids fault.  You have to be moderately functional with tech stuff. But.. you don’t need to use Bluetooth as a crutch for bad hearing as much as you did before.  This was the best investment I have made in a long time. It has changed the way my brain works and the way I interact with the world. Update 1 1/2 years later. I used to have awful, loud squealing tinnitus 24/7. I rarely notice now and only after not wearing the hearing aid for a while. It has made me hear or listen better so that I don’t say huh? all the time, even when I don’t have them on. I shorted out one pair with wet ears. They promptly replaced them for free. My charger broke. My fault. They replaced it free."
21,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Buyer Beware of OTC Hearing Aids and Amazon's Refund Policies on OTC Hearing Aids,"I bought the Lucid Engage OTC hearing aids after doing some research and also on the recommendation of a friend who uses them. I tried for three weeks and numerous phone calls to Lucid to get them to work properly. They would not hold the settings, which I think may be either/or hardware or app related. My final test was they day of a business lunch. I had dialed in and saved the settings per my instructions from Lucid technical support. To my disappointment the whole business lunch meeting was terrible. The Lucid aids actually amplified background noise, made the setting very uncomfortable and they didn't improve my ability to hear conversation from a client directly across from me.My lesson learned and advice for anyone needing hearing assistance. You can spend more time and effort searching for the right OTC hearing aid. In the end you can't really know how good the hardware quality is  and how well they will work for you. Like eyeglasses, you can order them online, but even with eyeglasses you need a professional to give you an eye exam and get the correct prescription before you can order glasses. The online hearing tests are vague and don't really tell you what your hearing loss is and therefore what device and adjustment will make them work best for you. I would also say there are many, many companies selling  inexpensive hearing devices from $200 to $1,500 that are questionable as to what they really will do.My advice is if you think you have hearing loss go to a professional and have your hearing assessed, then decide how you will address it. Costco is a good place to start as they will give you a no charge hearing test and they sell some reasonably priced brand name hearing aids.If you have insurance that covers hearing tests and hearing aids, by all means take advantage of your insurance benefit.Further on Amazon as relates to this transaction. BEWARE!. I have been prime member for years and make about 70 to 120 purchases per year. Returned items and refunds have always been handled in 3-5 days. NOT SO WITH OTC HEARING AIDS!!!I have been told at least 4 times my refund would come in 3-5 days, then I was told a refund takes up to 2 weeks, after two weeks I was assured I would have my refund in 3-5 days. I have an email stating a refund can take two weeks. My last phone call to Amazon was on 12/09/22, and I was now told a refund would take 30 days. I was also told there was nothing they or their supervisors could do as it was being automatically generated in their computer system. I will say this, Amazon customer service reps are very friendly and creative in the stories they make up as they go along. It is now 3 weeks, and as I told them I would file a dispute with with credit card company (which I did). AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED AMAZON GETS NO STARS AND ONE BLACK EYE FOR THIS ONE.SUMMARY: BUYER BEWARE OF OTC HEARING AIDS, AND BE DOUBLY AWARE OF PRUCHASING THEM THROUGH AMAZON. DON""T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY WITH OTC HEARING AIDS, IN MY EXPERIENCE, YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR AND THEY ARE MOSTLY JUNK."
21,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very pleasantly pleased,I read all the reviews and was concerned about purchasing this device. I so happy I bought them. I thought the setup was easy but I got frustrated that the device would not stay connected. I Googled this issue and realized I needed to setup the device. I have included a picture of the installation needed for iPhone. This installation resolved all my issues. I love my purchase!Update: charge the case separate from the hearing for a better charge.
21,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Frustrated,"UPDATED: I've reduced my 4 star review to 3. Here is why:These are good ""hearing aids"". However, the important feature I needed when researching OTC hearings aids was the ability to connect to Bluetooth devices, specifically, my iPhone. These connected for a while... maybe two months. But then they started to lose Bluetooth connectivity. It started with sound dropping out unexpectedly from one ear. Now, there is no iPhone connectivity at all. All I can do with them is use them as standard hearing aids. That would have been fine if that was all I was looking for.Extremely frustrated.Think this is a good product. I have a few issues. Every day the volume level seems to reset to level 5. Also, love the ability to LUCID to program for your specific hearing levels and SAVE to overwrite the defaults. Sometimes it loses those settings and I don’t know where it is saved to. Have to reprogram my settings. I did a screenshot so I have something to refer to."
21,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Lucid's android app makes this product unusable.,"I don't write reviews, but after paying this much for a product with such poorly written software I am massively frustrated.If you have an android phone, this is one of the only hearing aids that supports it. I understand the way android handles bluetooth audio makes certain features impossible, however, the Lucid app is beyond broken. It will constantly switch between the hearing aid 'program' and streaming 'program' unless you connect a 2nd BT device to stop it. You will have to do this otherwise you will not be able to adjust the EQ settings for the hearing aids. If you manage that, it still won't matter, as sometimes one hearing aid will decide your EQ settings are wrong and change them. You can change them back, save them again and hope but it'll probably revert back again. In my case, this results in having a mechanical form of tinnitus in my ear as it boosts the treble regions which I do not need, or worse, causes massive feedback inside of my ear.This is on top of having terrible bluetooth range and connection stability. Requiring you to make an account to even use their android app. Or the fact that the volume settings never save and will default to 7/10 whenever you reconnect the hearing aids.I'm returning these for a refund. Sound wise, these are wonderfully clear, when they work. So it's a real shame that hearing loss is less of an annoyance than interacting with Lucid's android app."
21,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great aids, but they won't stream with Motorola phones (and others)!","These aids are the real deal, they are pre-programmed with typical hearing-loss scenarios, but my loss is not typical!  The good news, though, is by using the app I can program each aid to compensate for my unusual hearing loss profile.  So, the hearing profile is programmable if you know what you are doing.  The app works great on my Motorola Android phone, but guess what:  the Moto phones are NOT compatible with the so called ASHA (Audio Streaming for Hearing Aids) standard.  So, while the app itself works great in controlling the aids, the app WILL NOT stream any audio from the Motorola phone, that means no ""Bluetooth calling"" or any streaming of music.  I found this out by talking to the helpful support person at Lucid.  Now, I either have to send these back, and/or change my phone (which I just bought!) to another brand which is ASHA compatible.EDIT:  I ended up returning these (I am a Prime member), and I had absolutely no issue with the return, unlike one 1-star reviewer.  These are quality hearing aids, and I would have kept them if they had been able to stream on my Motorola phone!"
21,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,Stopped working,"They work decent for the price , tuning isn’t as good as I’d like , 1 side went out 6 months after purchase, Amazon won’t exchange them so now they just sit on my desk and I’m out $700"
21,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Battery lasts all day with bluetooth streaming,"I love these hearing aids & happy I can listen to music at work wearing them. Love going cordless!  The battery lasts all day, even when using Bluetooth streaming. My regular blue tooth earbuds only lasted 4 hours while streaming. One problem is that the sound quality is not always good, but sometimes it is. I think this is more about where you are located, the atmospherics, etc.  I highly recommend these even if the sound quality is not perfect every time. Most of the time the sound is excellent."
21,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Customer support a problem,"I bought these hearing aids, when they delivered I put them on to charge right out of the box. I waited until they were completely charged before trying to use them. The left hearing aid was 100% but the right was only 3/4%. During the course of the day the right died faster then the left. I would try recharging them in the case, the left aid would charge to 100% but the right would only charge maybe a 1/4 of the way so it took multiple attempts at charging it to get it close to 100%. I reach out to the saller through Amazon; the saller response was to call customer support. I tried messaging customer support and never got a reply, I’m not even sure the messages were delivered. I also tried calling customer support and waited on hold until the phone disconnected on their end; I was on hold for nearly an hour. The next day I made several attempts to call that went unanswered so I left a voicemail. They returned my call at that point, I told the tech my problem and the told me to try charging the aids without plugging in the charging cord to the case; I have been charging them this way the whole time since the charger is supposed to charge without being plugged in. Being a general mechanic I work on equipment that uses batteries as well as electricity and know when a battery is bad, the right hearing aid’s battery was not good and needed to be replaced. Even after trying to charge the aid just like they said it still wouldn’t take a complete charge. Trying to get in touch with support takes much effort than I have time for and their solution to this problem didn’t work. $800 is a lot of money to pay for something to have problems right out of the box and not to get a resolution to the problem within a reasonable amount of time so I sent them back asking for a refund."
21,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Does its job,"I was planning to spend $2100 on one hearing aid for my left ear heart no loss, and was thrilled to find this less expensive option. This aid does assist my hearing, and I appreciate the Bluetooth and charging case.However, I was greatly disappointed to receive the hearing aids without a charging cable. When I contacted support, I was told it doesn’t come with a cable, even though it’s listed on the “what’s included” page of the instruction manual. You’d think an $800 device could include a $10 charger.The Bluetooth is convenient when it works, but it loses connection frequently; my $20 generic earbuds do a better job.But if all you need is something to help you hear, these are a great option."
21,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Hearing aids or tricky,Are used this product for clearance of hearing so far so good have not had them but one month. Don’t know where or how is the service after the sale that is the key question.

21,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Lucid a low-tech hearing aid,"I bought Lucid hearing aids at Sams for $3000, ($500 of that for insurance lost & damage) These need to be order for android or apple so if you change phones from Apple to Samsung you will be out of luck. While other companies will work with either phone, Lucid is so low-tech one of the only companies that its one or the other. Imagine if you had to order your car to work with Apple or Android. Lucid customer service is the horrible, I now needed one that work for android, and they send apple comparable since that is what I had 3 years ago, regardless that I paid the insurance and $400 deductible total of $900 for the second pair. These Lucid hearing aids pick up unnecessary background noise making the human voice still hard to hear someone. Now I am able to go and have these adjustments made at Sams, if you buy OTC, you will be on your own. I went in today and the tech hooks the Lucid hearing aids to a computer to try to get the background noise out and turn the sound up for human voice and I start to hear what I am saying back in my ear as an echo and unreasonably loud, so the tech adjusts them lower, and I can hear not much better wearing them. Maybe on Amazon you can return them, I was going to buy them on Amazon when a friend that wears them say that hearing aids have to be fitted so I went to Sams that sells Lucid and purchased them and had nothing but problems and still they don't improve my hearing enough to even use them and this has been going on for three years now on my second pair that I can't adjust the volume using the phone, or answer a phone call using the hearing aid. I can't adjust for wind and background noise with the Lucid phone App. Lucid does not make a remote to adjust them if you don't own a smart phone. But why would anyone want to buy from a company with such poor customer service, I was on the phone with Lucid after they came in as Apple and the associate said she talked to the Lucid rep., and he would do nothing. I even called the Lucid rep. since I wasn't going to pick them up from the store until they could change them to Android, and this went on for a month. The Sams associate said she could refund the $400 deductible, but I paid $500 for Insurance that I would be out so I said I would give them a try since they could be better than the first pair that I lost and if they worked, I would not be taking them out of my ears and wouldn't lose them. But they don't work any better and I went to the Amazon site to see what hearing aids they are selling, and I see they are selling the sub-standard Lucid hearing aid. Save your money don't buy Lucid or they also are sold under the Liberty name.  Lucid has very poor customer service, Lucid basically gave me the double middle finger."
21,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,These are Junk don't waste money!,"I bought these at Sam's.  Paid $1,600.00. Got no help from sales  person."
21,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Worked well until they broke and no service,They worked well when they weren’t broken but the Bluetooth connection can be described as abysmal. The app also sucks and you have to reconnect constantly which is a dealbreaker. Biggest issue was one of the hearing aids stopped working and I was just outside of their short warranty period and the only customer service they offered was to rebuy a new set. Can’t recommend these hearing aids or this company
21,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Hearing Aid System for both Ears with Smartphone APP interface option,"The first two features I noticed of the LUCID HEARING ENGAGE- RECHARGEABLE HEARING AIDS is the smooth fit in ear and very minimal squeal during insertion. These are the most comfortable and best fitting over the ear Hearing Aids ( amplifiers ) personally tried. They are discrete in my opinion. I don’t like that the kit does not have the AC Power Charger Module. Part# LA-EGBTE1-A-GR (Ean 0812944027391)- ANDROID COMPATIBLE -The Review system received is Android version. Admittedly I did not see the distinction between Android and IOS. I downloaded the IOS APP but it will not recognize the devices.Each system includes: Hearing Aids (2), USB charge cable, Rechargeable case w/ internal batteries, Wax stops plus a variety of S-M-L Solid and Vented Domes.  The units were received partially charged but I placed immediately on charge.  Within an hour both lights were solid green indicating Full Charge. With a cursory look at the control function I placed them on my ears.The Hearing Aids can be controlled and used without any manufacturer APP. The “ rocker type “ switch control is DUAL FUNCTION. Hold the switch for long moment UP or DOWN to change to one of the available four programs. A quick PRESS UP/DOWN changes volume. With the long PRESS to change programs a VOICE CONFIRMATION is received of the program selected.  These are Mild, Moderate, Bass Boost and Max. The control is easy for my stubby man hands to find and use while the device is on the ear. When the Hearing Aids are placed into the charging cradle they are automatically turned off.  Turn on- when removed.Fitting for me…. Worked out of the box. I am using the AIDS as received. The DOME smoothly slide into my ear and has been a comfortable fit. There was minor ( barely could be heard ) feedback ( squeal ) when installing in the ear.  As these stay in my ear I have experienced no squeal instances of the domes slipping out of the ear.Test….. has been in noisy restaurant, normal television, movie on television, news and normal household daily use.  In a word….. Excellent!  Recommended  Five  ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️  StarThank you for looking at my review.  If you found this review valuable please click on the Helpful Icon. Thanks 😊"
21,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Horrible service,I like the Engage rechargeable hearing aids from Lucid. I lost my right hearing aid and an email rep said to CALL Lucid to order a new one. No rep answered after 3 calls and 20 minutes of waiting. Pathetic. A good product with ZERO support and no online ordering.
21,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Very nice,"This hearing aid is pretty neat. It comes with a variety of solid and vented ear tips in different sizes so you can find what works best for you. It seems to be along the lines of modern earbuds in that they sync to your mobile phone via bluetooth, and there is an app that is used to control the settings on them and change the behavior. One of the things that I really am not crazy about is that these hearing aids are tied to a particular mobile OS, so they have an Android model and an iOS (iphone) model. I don't understand why they can't just work on both, so if you decide to switch phones then you would have to get a different hearing aid. One interesting observation, if you go look on the google play store at the lucid hearing app, it has pretty bad reviews right now, but on the iOS app store the lucid hearing app has much better reviews. I'd be curious to do a side by side comparison but can't.Anyway I have tried these with one of my android devices, had no problem syncing them and controlling all the various settings. I find these hearing aids to be comfortable and very helpful."

121,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Prescription quality hearing aids, amazing service","Short version: fit, sound quality, battery life, and customer service all equal or better than my last prescription set.Only small issue is that with the larger earbuds on, the case doesn't like to close. Hasn't affected the charging performance at all though.Long version:So I have moderate hearing loss (+90 db in certain frequencies) and have had prescription hearing aids previously. They were top of the line Starkey with all the bells and whistles.They were great, but unfortunately I lost them in a customers vehicle (I run an auto repair shop).After running around with the insurance company, I ordered these just to have something.Wow.These are every bit as good as the much more expensive prescription hearing aids. The fit, the sound quality, 100% professional level.They give you several earbuds to match your ears. Go one larger than you think, they are very soft. The first ones I used fit well but slipped out of my ear canal throughout the day. Going up one size really helped, and are still super comfortable.The battery life seems amazing. I wear them for 12-15 hours a day, in a very noisy environment, and no issues at all.The app is great. Simple to use, easy to enter my hearing test results. I did not try their built in hearing test, but I suspect it would give me identical results as the professional test.One thing that I highly recommend is the smart fitment feature. It uses AI (I assume) to make minor adjustments with a few simple clicks. Getting feedback? Hit the button. Loud noises too loud? Hit the button. Voices too quiet? You guessed it - hit the button.You can hit each one up to three times for more adjustment. It works extremely well. If that doesn't work, you can request assistance and they will reach out to assist in the fitment.They reached out to me a few days after getting them to ensure everything was working well. Extremely good customer service, they even offered to send me different receivers (the part that goes in the ear) if I wanted the older style with the small plastic wire to help retain the receiver in the canal. Absolutely amazing, they definitely want happy customers.Case is nice, I like the fact that it has a built in battery to charge the hearing aids even when I'm not near a charger (standard usb-c cord). I'm not sure how many charges the case alone can do, but even once or twice is nice when off grid.Not everything is perfect: the case is small, and with the earbuds attached, it really doesn't want to close. Also since it is so small, there is no room for the (included) brush or wax guards. I have to keep the box to store those accessories.There is no volume adjustment (that I can find) unless you use the app on your phone. Not a big deal, just would have been nice.Overall though, I would absolutely buy these again. They were cheaper than my last set, even with insurance, and I can now hear conversations clearly again. They are nearly invisible, super lightweight, and I don't feel nearly as isolated. Hearing loss really can affect your mental health, and is a contributing factor to Alzheimer's, so the relief of being able to hear again is almost overwhelming."
121,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Real professional hearing aids,"Worked great right out of the box! I uploaded my prescription from my audiologist and sound quality is excellent. I hear voices clearly without feedback. The great thing about Blaids that other companies can’t do is the specialist remote fitting. I saved different audiograms in different modes. I wanted to change some settings in the outdoor mode for when I go hiking and submitted a remote fitting request right in the app. By the time I woke up I already received and downloaded the adjustment from the Blaids specialist and it worked perfectly. The best part is it’s included at no cost and I don’t have to drive to my expensive audiologist.I use them for streaming calls as well and find it works seamlessly. Previously I had a pair of Phonak hearing aids for $6,000 and find that my Neuro’s from Blaids work much better for 1/10th of the price. I had a quick question about which dome to use and called their customer service. On the 2nd ring I was already talking to a REAL person! Apparently they are open 7 days a week 9-6 EST which is great because I work during the week so being able to speak to someone on the weekend is very helpful. I found the closed fit dome works better for severe hearing loss, open fit with holes is better for more mild hearing loss as it lets in some natural sound as well.I tried other brands on amazon and found they were too basic with very little customization and no specialist remote fitting. The family member that originally recommended Blaids to me mentioned it is because of their professional hearing aid chip. He is an audio engineer so I trust his judgement. Highly Recommend!"
121,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Unregulated OTC hearing deivice,"This review is not compensated for in anyway.  I am a hearing aid user for over twenty years.  And I think it is fantastic the industry is trying to make available OTC devices that do not cost thousands of dollars.  However, it is unfortunate that the regulators are not able to access each product sold closely.  I have used and been satisfied with Audicus over the counter, and Lexis OTC aids.  And I now have OTC JABRA which I love.  This particular instruments has a app that does not stay connected.  The aid also comes with many self controlled adjustments; but lets be real here....how many people understanding setting gain and equalization in a hearing instrument.  Also, they do not provide adequate aftercare support with little or no follow up while both Lexis, Audicus and JABRA provide easily accessible telephone and online support with professional auditory professionals.  This aid costs less then the other two products mentioned; but it falls more into the category of an amplifier.  I can easily say that while the JABRA costs less then a costco or seimens  aid (I have had both) which require in-person fitting; the Blade does not compare to the JABRA, Lexie, or Audicus which are OTC hearing aids.As you have probable assessed I had to return this product, and I am glad that Amazon has a longer return policy so that I had time to try to make this product work for me.  Unfortunately as much as I wanted to hear better, with this product it was not possible.  The most common problems were:  feedback, chatter, wind noise, loud background noises and of course the poor app."
121,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,The hearing test app,"been on quite the hearing aid journey! Finding the right hearing aids can be a challenge, but it’s essential for improving your quality of life. Let’s break down some key points based on my experience:Amazon Hearing Aid Purchases:It’s common to explore different options, especially when buying online. However, the quality and effectiveness of hearing aids can vary significantly.Returning them when they don’t meet your expectations is a smart move. After all, you deserve the best for your hearing health.Professional Hearing Aids:The hearing aids i mentioned are available at Amazon and come with some impressive features:Prescription Upload: You can upload your prescription from your nose, throat and ear doctor. This personalized approach ensures that the hearing aids are tailored to your specific needs.Hearing Test App: The app is a valuable tool for fine-tuning your hearing aids. It helps optimize settings based on your hearing profile.Crystal Clear Sound: The absence of background noise is a game-changer. High-quality hearing aids can provide a natural listening experience without interference.Professional vs. Over-the-Counter (OTC) Hearing Aids:Professional hearing aids, like the ones i purchased, offer more advanced features and customization.OTC hearing aids are available without a prescription but may not provide the same level of precision or personalized care.Price Consideration:The $700 sale price at Amazon seems reasonable for professional-grade hearing aids.Remember that investing in your hearing health is crucial. Quality hearing aids can significantly impact your daily life.Audiologist Support:If you have any questions or need adjustments, consult an audiologist. They can fine-tune the settings to match your unique hearing requirements."
121,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,Will have to re-evaluate after a couple weeks,"Very easy to initially set up though, as others have said, the bluetooth set up in their app is ""very"" slow to connect (and I have no problem with other bluetooth devices).  That said, I'm not sure that this is the one for me.Definitely a good hearing improvement in the right ear but the left unit has a constant static noise --- no matter what adjustments I make, it doesn't go away so, either I'm doing something wrong or the left unit is defective.My experience with electronics is that if something arrives in less than perfect condition, chances are the overall quality is less than stellar.  I have an appointment set up with someone at Blaids on Tuesday morning (it's currently Saturday) that was the first one available to see if they can rectify the situation.Beyond that, the ear plugs themselves (not the tube or the unit itself) are of less than great quality.We'll see how it goes Tuesday morning but I'm guessing they're going to tell me that the left unit is defective and will need to be replaced.  If that's the case, the entire set is going back.UPDATE:  After fiddling with it more, I decided to return it, bite the bullet, and go to an actual audiologist instead.  The static in the left ear isn't my hearing as I can insert the right one in and it's just fine.  The idea of spending $800 on something that comes in defective doesn't give much hope that it's going to last for the long term."
121,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,BlaidsX Neuro-a good value for a Bluetooth hearing aid.,"Have had my BlaidsX Neuro Rechargeable RIC hearing aids almost one month.  They are great!PRO:• Connection to smartphones via Bluetooth is automatic.• The “hearing self-test” feature is very good.  I was surprised at how repeatable the audiograms are (although the volume steps are coarse).  To satisfy curiosity, I put right and left aids in left and right ears and got almost the same results.  Several audiograms are stored so those made at different times can be compared.• Several sizes of “domes” are included to accommodate various size ear canals.• The aids seem to be quite durable and well-made .• Several tools are included for maintaining the aids.CON:• The included “User Manual” is for a different (maybe older) model.• The “User Manual” is disappointing as it is sorely lacking in important information.  For example, what the included tools are used for is not mentioned.  After using the aids for almost a month, the right one went silent although it was fully charged.  Called the support number and got a very knowledgeable lady who talked me through changing the “wax filter” which restored normal operation.  There is no mention of a wax filter in the manual.  Apparently, the filters must be replaced frequently and they are quite expensive.• The manual references several advanced features called “Smart Fitting” but smart fitting on my Android phone only lets me set the relative volume between right and left aids.  Perhaps they are only available on iPhones.• There are two buttons on the aids.  They are not mentioned in the manual but it is easy to determine they are volume controls.• The aids shut down well before the batteries still have more than 50% charge remaining; maybe get 10-12 hours use but the charging case is convenient to use without being plugged into a power source.• The sales literature shows the hearing test results to be a continuous curve when in actuality the results are just results at six frequencies (250, 500, 1000, 2000, 4000, & 8000 Hz).  I have seen 3000 and 6000 Hz show up but if there is a way to consistently test at more than the six basic frequencies, I have not found it.  (I am a retired engineer.)• There is an email address for support but I never received a reply when I emailed my concerns and questions."
121,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Rebirth of my social life,"Over the last number of years I found myself socializing less often and not participating in the conversations when I did go out.  The reason was, I was having trouble hearing conversations and found myself backing away from a conversation or just not going out.  I met someone who noticed I would saying ""huh' when people spoke to me.  She recommended that I consider BlaidsX nNeuro hearing aids.  What a social life changer!!! So I am an older guy and not tech savvy so I was a little nervous I would not be capable of getting something in the mail and getting it set up correctly. I ordered the new streaming model and Blaidsx hearing aids immediately let me know what I was missing. My nervousness concerning setup was quickly overcome by how great, knowledgeable and professional the customer service was. First of all when you call you get a real human right away not having to wait on hold or leave a message on a machine. The technical knowledge they had helped me make some small adjustments to make the hearing aids reach a level of satisfaction that I didn't expect.  One thing I noticed is that there a number of different sized ear domes (tips which go on the end of the hearing aids that go into your ear). I started with a medium one, then moved to the largest one as a comparison, lastly I put on the smallest. For me the smallest gave me the best results. I am so happy I took the chance, I have a rebirth of my social life."
121,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Jury is still out,"First; I have worn hearing aids for five years and I have been to the audiologist enough times to know their routine and how their devices fit and perform.  I decided to try these Blades hearing aids because they would be less than half the price I'd have to pay a professional doctor's office and the app looked like it would give me complete control of the device.My new hearing aids arrived a day early, on Sunday.  I was really impressed with the fast service.  Since they have arrived, I have attempted to use them straight out of the box.  The app showed the battery was charged to approximately 50% so I thought all would be well.They shut off, unexpectedly, twice during the evening of the first day.  Today, the second day, I verified that they are fully charged and I have used the app to complete the app controlled hearing test and successfully saved the hearing test audiogram (hearing profile).  All seems to be working well today, so far.  If these hearing aids can't stay on all day, I'll be sending them back because there is ZERO reason why they should ever shut off except if the batteries run out.I will update this review if they fail today, but so far, I'm impressed and very pleased with the price, performance and fit."
121,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Only one works, returned, good support, second unsure","Was too optimistic, I guess.  Only the left one works.  The right one seems completely dead.  Is there an on/off switch for them?  No mention anywhere of that.  But the left one powered up right away.The documentation that came up with the QR code on the card in the box describes the unit that has replaceable batteries.  The PDF link on Amazon is better.Because the right one is dead, obviously the bluetooth connection to it fails, too.  The problem seems to be there in the carrying case, the right spot is not working, so the right device doesn’t charge. I was able to charge it in the left slot but now whichever unit is in the right slot doesn’t turn off, so drains the battery and whistles in the caseCompare to the Bose/Lexie B2 app quality and documentation and general fit. The Lexie holds together better but technically might not be as good.The app is pretty bad, too.  Clearly not designed by professional Ux designers.  Notification pop-ups all say ""Hint"" and they're not.  There's an unlabeled toggle on the upper left that pops up one of these ""Hint"" boxes that is not useful. I’m a perfectionist when it comes to apps.But… I processed a return and ordered a new set. The vendor has been very helpful so far. Will update this later.Update: the second set performed poorly, so I returned them. Took a while to process the refund. They tested the second pair and found no problems, so I’m open to the possibility that I’m at fault. PhD in computer science, lifelong software developer. Must have slipped a a cog.All in all very good communication with the vendor despite me being a frustrated customer. They stuck with me."
121,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,On second though!,"My first impression of the hearings aids was not good.  Probably because I didn't have them programmed right.  With the help from Blaids support I think these hearings aids are going to be just fine.  It's already much better than it was, and hopefully will continue.  As of now I would definitely recommend these aids."
121,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,They work! Fantastic reps!,"Bought these for my spouse, who has hearing concerns. One concern is the price that hearing aides cost! But seriously, the other is how they work or sadly, don't. These do. Had other brands, that just made things louder. These aides do not just amplify. They actually allow for individual adjustment of volume, per ear, by using your connected phone. They also allow for indoors, outdoors, movie/tv and more. The company reps have been fantastic and walked him through the steps to set up his hearing system and other follow up questions. He has a pair of aides, and the non-battery self charger system. His hearing levels are moderate to severe. And these have been working fantastically. Such a difference in his quality of life! Plus, others we were looking at cost at least twice as much. Try these! I know they work."
121,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent product!,"I love my Blaids! I initially bought the XPro model over a year ago then decided to upgrade to rechargeable Neuro and have been highly satisfied with both devices. Had zero problems with either device and was even able to program myself based on the hearing test from the audiologist. Anything I need from Blaids their customer service assists me immediately, calls me back and follows through on exactly what they said they’d do.The hearing aids themselves are highly advanced. I’ve worked in healthcare for many years and have yet to see a better set, including the ones I see for sometimes over $7,000. I tried a few other OTC brands on amazon but they were not comparable to my Neuros. The sound clarity I get is unmatched. Its so refreshing to finally find a great American company with good technology and people genuinely helping their customers solve a big problem (hearing loss). Highly Recommend!"
121,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Outstanding Customer Service,"The Blaids X Neuro are my first hearing aids and so I can't compare them to others. I'm in my late 60's and my hearing loss kind of snuck up on me. After realizing I was having everyone repeat their comments, I had a hearing exam and discovered I have moderate to severe loss. Started looking at hearing aids and discovered a wide range of options with prices from around $200 all the way up to $8,000. It was a bit overwhelming. Began to focus on rechargeable aids that were app controlled and almost bought a different brand until I read their app only had a 2.1 star rating.  I read that the app for Blaids X Neuro has 4 stars. The aids arrived yesterday and it didn't take long to upload my audiogram and I really liked the many fine tuning options, settings and modes available.  The instruction manual is a little sparse and could have had a bit more info especially for a newbie like me, but the customer service for this company is outstanding. I emailed the questions I had instead of calling them so that I would have something to refer back to if needed.  They were quick to respond, very thorough and easy to understand.  I did not realize that overtime, my hearing loss had caused me to miss out on some of the world around me.  I am very happy with my purchase of these Blaids X Neuro and wish the company continued success."
121,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wonderful hearing aids and wonderful product support.,When I first received my hearing aids one of the hearing aids would not charge.  I contacted their product support and they have been the most helpful of any product or company that I have dealt with ever. They not only resent a new pair but they upgraded them to have Bluetooth in them as well. They have been very responsive and have worked with me to get maximum performance out of my hearing aids. Best product ever. In the past I had hearing aids for about 10 years that I got through an audiologist. These app perform those by a thousand times. The self-hearing screen was so closely mirrored the audiology test that I took from an audiologist that it surprised me. Don't hesitate to order these hearing aids because their product support is so good that they will make anything right and take a lot of time helping you with them.
121,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,enhanced life?,"Maybe you could get by with a hearing aid that’s a little cheaper but these are absolutely fantastic. Just put them on and forget them absolutely love it. The hearing test that comes with the that is free that you control your hearing aids and has a test with it to set them up properly, I only set mine up one time so far and I’m so happy I’m just gonna leave it like it is. I had not realized how many times that I said, huh?"
121,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Quality and excellent customer service at a reasonable price,"I’ve had a pair of much more expensive hearing aids in my past, from about 3 years ago and the right rechargeable battery malfunctioned this month.  Of course it was out of warranty.  In my search through Google and Amazon I noticed the BlaidsX Neuro OTC hearing aids.  They are small unnoticeable behind the ear with in ear receivers, very well made, a rechargeable case that, unplugged, charges them for 2-3 charges at least.  Also the Blaids App allows for self hearing test, calibration, fine tuning and software updates.  This is the first company I’ve done business with where the CEO, Austin, has answered questions in chat online - very supportive and empathetic.  Also, I’ve contacted customer support by phone and spoken with Brian and Emmett.  They were so helpful, personable and patient with the questions I had and providing an adjusted file to the app overnight that downloaded right to my hearing aids.  This improved the quality of the sound.  Brian called me later to confirm that the new download helped solve my concern - what great customer service!  I am extremely please with the quality of the product and the excellent support from the company.  Go to the Blaidshearing.com and read about their product, CEO and great prices before considering a different brand."
121,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Why pay more?,Why pay more especially if you have slight or moderate hearing loss?  You can pay $100ths if not $1000ths more for hearing aids supplied by your ear doctor or audiologist but why do so when you can spend a lot less buying the BlaidsX Neuro hearing aids?  It has all the features of the more expensive hearing aids.  If you are even a bit familiar with using apps on your smart phone the Blaids app allows you to fine tune the aids to match your specific hearing issues. It even has a hearing test routine whose output allows you to automatically get very close to the best settings for you particular hearing situation.  You can get an even better fit by getting a professional hearing test.  The Blaids app allows you to easily upload the results of the audiogram into the hearing aids.  On the other head if you are not technically proficient using smart phone apps the support given by the Blaids technical hot line is outstanding whether by phone or by email.
121,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not for narrow ear canals!!!,This hearing aid has a metal rectangular piece that is to be inserted into the ear canal that is fairly wide. It was hard to use and led to the plastic getting stuck inside the ear! My dad had to go to the urgent care/ENT to have it surgically removed from his inner ear. Stay away from this unless you have large openings for your ear canal! Otherwise I gave it two stars because the app allows you to adjust the volume and it was a nice feature.
121,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Ease of programmability and clear sound clarity,"This hearing aid is fantastic! It is so easy to program on my phone and make changes whenever my environment changes. When it first arrived, I was able to give myself a new hearing test on the app, which made setting it up so natural for my hearing. The app is simple, intuitive and I can pull it up on my phone at anytime. The sound that is delivers is first rate and has made a big difference for me already. This is a big leap forward for consumers who don't want to rely on multiple trips to the doctor for their hearing needs.  I would highly recommend this brand. Knowing Blaids's specialist can make adjustments and help me fit remotely was a big plus. Only brand I found that has this capability."
121,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Finally, user programmable hearing aides !!","I am really impressed with the quality & feature set in these hearing aids. I wanted hearing aides that were programmable because my hearing loss in my left ear is much worse compared to my right ear. I was able to upload my audiogram quickly with the help of their excellent Customer Service. The app allows the user to further tweak the settings as needed.  You can easily switch modes either in the app or on the hearing aid. Once you have your settings loaded, you do not need to connect to your smart phone. However, I am hopeful that there will be s software upgrade soon to utilize more Bluetooth features. I love the rechargeable battery case. Do yourself a favor and try these hearing aids before you buy the more expensive ones. I highly recommend them!"
121,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,VERY ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY,"The BlaidsX Neuro is by far the most advanced hearing aid I’ve owned so far. Previously I had the Blaids X Pro model which was excellent, but I wanted to switch to something rechargeable. I’ve tried the Lexie B2 and Sony but found they do not have the excellent sound quality that the Neuro has. Blaids allows me to upload my audiogram from my doctor which puts them in the professional category of Phonak and Starkey but for nowhere near the cost. The Blaids app has basically unlimited adjustments available, their pro fitting section allowed me to go in and adjust the gain on each frequency without having to drive all the way to an expensive doctors visit! Its like having an audiologist in my pocket. When I called a nice man based in the U.S. (Brian) answered the phone on the second ring, I can’t believe I didn’t need to talk to a machine! Great customer service!"
121,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,My Grandmother’s face lit up with Joy,We got these hearing aids for my grandma after she lost 40% of her hearing. She had tried other hearing aids with mixed results. At first when she put them she told me they were nice but worked as good as her other pair. The difference was after we had her take the audiogram hearing test for each ear. Once she completed the easy to use audiogram from the app her face lit up with joy after she realized the difference. Out of the box they were decent but after we tailored them to the frequencies she could still hear they were beyond exceptional. 5 Stars great product!!! I would recommend them to anyone who themselves had a hearing loss or to anybody who has a loved one who is experiencing hearing loss.Michael McGow
121,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,As good as $4000 Hearing aid,"These are NOT 'hearing' amplifiers !They are every bit a good a the $4000 hearing aids my audiologist prescribed,in that they amplify from 0 to whatever is nedded by narow frequency ranges and not a fixed amplification over entire frequency range. (FWIW, the instruction book and app are very well done. Because of the customization enabled, it takes a little trial and error to get them fine tuned for your hearing.)howeverI suffer from Covid induced APD (Auditory Processing Disorder).I can hear people talking to me, BUT I can't understand them :(I would recommend these for people 'hard of hearing' , but if you suffer from APD, they won't help :("
121,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Clarity problem,Tried to get them tuned to where they didn’t have any static but could never get them to quit it. Clarity seemed “ tinny “ to me as well. Retuned them after a couple of weeks.
121,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great value!,In my opinion these are almost as good as the $6000 ones the audiologist wanted to sell me.  Lots of adjustments with the app on my cellphone.
121,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome. hearing aids,For the price the hearing aids are really excellent especially with the extra discount.  They fit is good and the hearing test worked well.  I returned a $4000 pair of hearing aids that I had bought because are equivalent.Addendum.  The customer service is awesome.  I had a hard time keeping the aids in and so they equipped them with Concha locks at no charge.  The hearing aids are great and easy to adjust the sound.
121,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,FANTASTIC,Before I got these I tried 2 other brands and had to return both pairs. The first pair would only work in the left ear. The second pair had an App that was incompatible with my phone. Of course this was not mentioned in the ad. I made sure the App for these would download before I ordered them. These are the bomb!! Natural sound and the App is phenomenal.
121,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,They’re awesome!!,They are just wonderful! I had some questions and they were very good to call me and answer all my questions and offer support. I know I can call them any day and they will help me.
121,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Instructions seem to be very good,Work as shown in write up There's a learning curve
121,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Update,This is an update to my previous review. I have finally been connected to help & service was great. I have a new left aid & they helped me set it up. So far so good.

121,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,BlaidsX Neuro,"I just received these hearing aids for my father in law, setup was easy, the listening test was great and actually matched up perfectly to the one he had done in a doctors office, the fit he likes a lot , and the charging case is his favorite part. Overall he is incredibly happy!"
121,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,Good device but no Bluetooth interface. That's a pity.,"Good device. Asked customer but they don't have Bluetooth interface for streaming. Asked customer service about the issue. They say it is going to be updated in two weeks - since August, then September, then October. Now it is end of October and they need another 4 to 5 weeks.Had to return it to Amazon."
121,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Software and design problems,The software would not connect properly both to my smartphone and my tablet. I gave up after 40 to 50 attempts always getting the same message YOUR APPLICATION CRASHES ALL THE TIME. Also the charging device is poorly designed. Il is very difficult to insert the hearing aids into the proper slot and to close the cover. Another detail. The charging slot for the right aid is on the left side and vice-versa.
121,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Best advice DON’T,"I really don’t like writing bad reviews, but if it saves someone else from watching money than I need to share my experience with these hearings aids.I was going to send them back cause I had trouble with the right one, but was asked to please just return it for a replacement, so I returned it well my 30 days had passed for Amazon refund, but I had 15 days cause I had 45 days to try the hearing aids and since I had returned the right one I was to honestly give it a try, could have just flushed the money down the toilet or burned it and I would be in the same boat.UPDATE!!!!!!!Everything stopped working yesterday, the charger, so no hearing aids . October 16, 2023 waste of a lot of money.."
121,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Don’t believe in everything you hear,There ripped of the comfort I would use a funnel to my ear like they did in the olden days it would work better
121,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Failed - Twice,"I purchased these hearing aids twice...both times, one hearing aid failed. The first purchase made it not quite 2 months before one hearing aid squealed non-stop (guessing a mic went bad). The second purchase was only 2 weeks before one hearing aid went dead. No response at all. Not sure what the problem is but it is consistent.At this price point expect way better. Have purchased hearing aids that cost less than $200 and still going strong.  Disappointed for sure."
121,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Garbage, just like the rest of the crap Bezos pushes on this site.",DOA straight out of the box.
121,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth the cost,The best things about the hearing aids is that they are returnable
121,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,A great company,"I loved it right out of the box. I am retired USAF vet. The VA gave me Synia aids which never really worked for me after several tries. I ran across Blaids ad somewhere and hit their site on Amazon. I was around jet aircraft for 30 years and really hearing impaired. For the price with coupon, I ordered. I am 89 now and have never had such Customer Service. I'm not use to a company striving to help. Well done all who work there.  Rod Tanner USAF RET."
121,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing sound and quality. Great Customer Service,Customer Service is the best and the quality is amazing. I love the sound and the clarity of it. Love that they are US-based and give back to the community by giving back to the Veterans. The hearing aids are the same or better quality than the ones my husband got prescribed by the Veterans hospital. They are very comfortable and barely visible.

121,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product,Recently bought the Blaids Neuro Rechargable RIC hearing aids. These really work well. The sound is excellent and there is no echo or background  noise like with over-the-counter ones I had before. Programming them with the app is easy and if I did have any questions the telephone support was very good.Steve
121,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great after the purchase service!,"12-28-23  I purchased my Blaids hearing aids in February 2023.  They worked great, and I liked being able to adjust the hearing aids when they were connected to my smart phone via Bluetooth.I lost my right hearing aid when on vacation in November, and immediately called Blaids.  With no discussion, Blaids sent me a new set of hearing aids with a discount coupon, and a change of color for the hearing aids for a very reasonable price.The Blaids representative was very helpful and very courteous, and I would recommend the Blaids hearing aids to anyone desiring reasonably priced hearing aids that work the way they are supposed too.  I replaced my more expensive hearing aids with the Blaids hearing aids, and was pleasantly surprised to discover that the Blaids hearing aids were superior in every way.Blaids has certainly earned my 5 star rating!Sara"
121,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Experience and Product,"I concur with the reviews that extoll the quality of the hearings aids as being as good as or better than the $4500 pair I had. I also give high marks to their Customer Service Team that was extremely helpful and professional when I needed some help getting my hearing aids fine tuned. All the representatives I talked with were very helpful, patient, and knowledgeable. The total experience has been excellent and easy."
121,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a programable hearing aid, not a sound amplifier",This over the counter hearing aid has many of the same advantages of prescription hearing.  The key outstanding feature is that it is programable based on a hearing test that is completed over the smart phone app.  The hearing aid fits well without requiring a professionally made molded ear canal piece.  The slotted canal piece allows sound that does not need to be amplified into the ear canal. The hearing aids are nicely packaged and the instruction manual is easy to follow.  Another great feature is that no batteries are needed.
121,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Terrific aids. Finally a real value VRs expensive options,I like everything about these aids. I upgraded from the Neuro  blaids model and these are a valuable step up for me. I have very serious hearing loss and I m moving forward with these. Dual microphones make things easy in large groups and reduce my stress. The charging function works well and reduces the wear and tear compared to the battery models. Clarity is exceptional as I can fine tune individual voices as I go. Customer service is a plus. Real people listen to you and explain any needed fixes. All in all. Buy these and send a pair to your friends who paid $2000 and never wear their aids.
121,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,The company has great product and stands behind it.,"These are the best hearing aids I've ever used, they do not fall out of my ears, they fit nicely in my ears. I would recommend these to anyone of my friends, the company has taken very good care of me and given me technical support when I have needed it very promptly, they even quickly have replaced product that had a problem and provided a return shipping label. They definitely stand behind everything they sell.I previously have owned their hearing aids that require putting batteries in them and have upgraded to the rechargeable hearing aids, both types of hearing aids are programmable which is not very complicated to do and they will provide you with technical assistance if you need.You have 48 channels of different sounds that you can program to your own hearing loss. The app gets downloaded on your smartphone, then you can take the hearing test using your smartphone or you can upload a hearing test to your smartphone from an audiologist which will get programmed to your hearing aids, you can adjust the volume of your hearing aid, etc. just using your smartphone. You also are able to use your smartphone to tweak any of the programmable uploaded hearing aid tests.I have been thoroughly enjoying the many benefits of these hearing aids and the reliability of the company.Patricia"
121,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Quality of the product,My husband has been using these heating aides for several weeks now and at first he was skeptical but now he wears them all the time. He isn’t technical so I was able to set everything up on my iPhone very easily and programming it to his audiogram was effortless. I’d say the reasonable cost was a good investment!
121,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,BlaidsX Neuro RIC  Awesome FDA Registered Hearing Aid,"Blaids Hearing has a focus on its mission of providing superior hearing aid products at an affordable price with unmatched customer service!My experience has truly been a wonderful journey to better hearing provided by a friendly knowledgeable customer service and technical specialist staff, bravo!!!!I am looking forward to additional fine tuning and potential upgrades to enhance my BlaidsX Hearing experience. This is a with quality people and products available 7 days a week to help people restore their hearing as best a possible, their success depends on your successful improved hearing satisfaction."
121,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Ease of use and programmability.,"WE LOVE THESE HEARING AIDS! Why caps and yelling because for years I have been trying to find the right aids for my mom. The owner, Austin Groves has been AMAZING with being so available and gentle with my 89 year old mom. Her sight is limited and she has been using and recharging with fantastic success. Thank you Blaids for saving my voice and sanity. My mom Thanks you too. Gerry Thorpe"
121,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,,"Hoy recibí los audífonos, los cuales llegaron muy rápido a Colombia, solo 5 días, viene muy bien embalado y observando los audífonos se ven de buena calidad, muy pequeños y por el momento, estoy traduciendo el manual a español para empezarlos a usar, en unos días estaré comentando las críticas de la parte técnica de los audífonos."
88,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Good, easy-to-use hearing aids that provide decent sound amplification","I found these to be quality hearing aids that were comfortable to wear, easy to use, and that worked really well.  The kit comes with the standard charging case and cable (no actual charger - no big deal, I've got many lying around already connected to a variety of cables).  Over and above that, though, the provide a selection, not only of ear pieces, but of the tubes that connect the behind-the-ear body to the earpiece itself.  I found a combination that fit even my ears perfectly.The hearing aids themselves are comprised of a small (1.5"" long) body that fits behind the ear, a clear formed tube that curves around into your ear, and an earpiece with a short pull string on the end of the tube that you insert into your ear canal.  I found the design works really well.  I do wear glasses, and ended up needing to get the hearing aids in place before I put on my glasses...just worked out easier.The hearing aids worked very well.  Because of their behind-the-ear position, I could hear every creak and scrape when I moved in the chair after first putting them on.  That worried me a little, but that worry was baseless.  They did a great job of picking up sounds from all directions - I could hear the TV easily, my dogs snoring at my feet, my fingers typing on the keyboard, anything I was doing with my hands that caused noise.  I was able to hear my wife talking to me without having to ask her to repeat things.  They even provided a noticeable level of noise reduction. When I work, I sit about 10 feet from a window air conditioner unit.  While I could still hear it, the ambient noise level did seem to be lower.I feel the controls are another area where these hearing aids really shine.  Each aid has a single rocker switch that allows you to turn it on and off and adjust the volume up and down.  These controls are on the body that's behind the ear, and they're incredibly easy to use, even for my fingers.  You put on the aid, and it's zero effort to turn on once you're wearing it by pressing the top of the rocker switch for 3 seconds.  Adjusting the volume is just as easy.  One really neat feature that I discovered is that the hearing aids communication with each other - if you turn one of them off, they both turn off.  Amazing!!These hearing aids seem to be on the higher end of the price scale, but you're getting a lot for your money in terms of quality, comfort, and convenience."
88,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Amplify Everything,"My title basically sums up my entire review. These are little amplifiers. They don't discriminate. They amplify everything. If that's what you need, then they work fantastic.Even if you just wanted voices amplified, these are still a great deal over $10k sets from the doctor, that insurance won't cover. Normal ears don't distinguish sounds, everything is heard, not just voices. So, if you're not sensitive to background noises, these do the job.The only thing I thought was weird is that the charging case plugs in on a bottom. My OCD would prefer the case in the upright position, but that in no way impacts performance. Just a personal preference."
88,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,It is definitely overpriced,It is definitely overpriced when compared with the cheaper product and its deliveries. I got this for Mother she has a couple of these hearing aid devices at her home and my home because she either forgets to charge them or forgets where she put so having multiple spare units is always good. The sound quality is good and there is moderate background noise. I would think twice ordering this again if the price doesn't go down about the 150-200 range.
88,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worked great,"Sound is amazing with four different amplification settings. Normal frequency which boosts all sound. High frequency which boosts the higher pitch sounds more. Low frequency to boost lower pitch sounds. And a general boost which gives a richer boost to all frequencies. The is great because they ALL work and provide a very noticeable difference, not just say it does. It comes with a measurement device and three different size slim tubes and a bunch of different domes for finding your perfect fitment.This also connects via Bluetooth to your phone, tablet, computer and other electronics with a capable Bluetooth connection. With the ability to answer/ hang up calls and listen to music.The battery life is great when used only as a hearing device, they lose a bit when connected via Bluetooth and answering the occasional call and lose a ton more when used with Bluetooth for constant talking or streaming. The rechargeable case helps with constant streaming greatly and the indicating lights are very helpful. With the case you can get at least eight hours of total usage.Overall I found these work great for my needs. Yes I did receive these free for review and Ifeel they are a little pricey and hope that comes down a bit to help others with hearing problems however they do WORK amazingly! Absolutely no squealing and the sound was great. I hope this helps and you find what you need."
88,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,They fit comfortably and work well,I really couldn't say if there are better quality ones out there but these are just as good as you would expect. When in the air even the slightest amount of amplification goes a long way I have a few hard of hearing people that allowed to try them as well and it has helped they all recommended it even at that price point. My hearing is not the greatest and it is resourceful to have these in situations where I'm having a hard time.
88,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,My First Impression,"1. First, let me say I have been experimenting with several different brands of over the counter hearing aids/amplifiers.2. This GOULTRA brand is the first one I have tried that does not use the word ""AMPLIFIER"" in its description.3. This one is priced $200.00 more than the most expensive brand I previously tried.4. The instruction manual is very precise and detailed and is easily understandable in plain English.5. The hearing aids are very easy to use.6. The 2 buttons on each hearing aid are easy to press and very responsive.7. The Bluetooth connectivity is also very easy.  It paired quickly to both my Android and iPhones.8. The included accessories are all labeled making it simple to get what you need without having to sort through different sized domes and tubes.9. The recharging case is also easy to charge and store your hearing aids.10. Each hearing aid operates independently, meaning you will set the volume and the listening mode for the left and right hearing aid separately.11. When using Bluetooth for phone calls or music you can control the volume on one hearing aid for both hearing aids.12. Each hearing aid has 10 volume levels and 4 listening programs.13. This does not use an APP so there is not a hearing test available.14. Bottom Line:This is the best over the counter hearing aid I have tried.  It is easy to use, has decent sound quality and excellent volume control for those needing more volume and for those needing less volume.My advice, read the instruction manual completely so you will understand how to properly wear these hearing aids and how to best use them.  Everything is explained in detail.  What I don't like is the ""Slim Tubes"" and the ""Domes"" will need replacing in 4 to 6 months (according to the owners manual).  Although different sized Domes and Slim Tubes are provided, I feel that extra parts should have been provided for at least the first 2 years of ownership especially at this price range."
88,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Go Ultra - A Lot to Like,"There's a lot to like about these OTC hearing aids:Presentation - Compactly packaged in a low profile rechargeable case with necessary accessories included.Appearance - These small gray aids will disappear as effectively as the non-OTC types without sacrificing any  functionality.Fit - These are easy to put on, even for a novice. They are ergonomically shaped from one end to the other so that it was easy to slip behind each ear and place the dome inside the canal. There is a plastic ""wire"" added that sits right in the bowl of your ear and seems to actually work to keep the aid in place. At least it worked well for me. My husband didn't see the purpose and wanted it off. It may depend on ear shape.Choice - You not only get a choice of dome sizes. You also get to choose open or closed, depending on how much outside noise you can tolerate or if you are using them via Bluetooth for music or phone and want to hear only that. I appreciated being given that option.Instructions - Very good, complete, well written instructions. Easy to follow. Detailed. Helpful. Sadly, not all products can say the same, so this becomes an important ""pro"" when considering choices.Ease of Use - Given the small size of these behind the ear devices, and the fact that there is no app to use on a device, I wondered just how easy it would be to operate the on/off, volume, and program switch procedure. I found the buttons responsive and, after a varying learning curve depending on user, should not be a problem. It is easy to find the buttons and operate them.Function - There is zero feedback on these. The volume choices could be more distinct. It is not always obvious that the volume changed, and the range is limited. Although the programing gives you some choice in accentuating high or low sounds, these are still not as adjustable as the ones available through an audiologist. I only mention this so you are aware how they differ.The bottom line is that these are very good OTC alternatives for someone desiring a good hearing device without the 4 figure tag. These are still a little steep for a lot of people. I need to acknowledge that.A good product, well designed, well thought out, and comfortable to wear even with glasses."
88,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Dual (both ear) rechargeable hearing amplification aids-Good Starter Kit,"GO ULTRA OTC ASIN: B0C1NQQ84B ADULT HEARING AID AMPLIFIER KIT is rechargeable system with charging storage case.  My observation and opinion is this complete system has every thing needed to get started with usage of an amplifier system.  The KIT includes….. an amplifier for each ear, various type tips for in ear fitting,  various length tubes, charger cable, AC Power Module, Charging/ Storage Case and User Manual.The kit is on the higher side of expense in comparison for kits of this type.  However, in my opinion and experience with this system and other systems I consider this a good starter system for someone who has never experienced hearing amplifiers.  System is indicated for Adults 18 and over both Women and Men. The Manufacturer offers “ Return within 45 days of purchase for Refund “ plus full one year Warranty.  Support email and phone number included.The User Manual is one of the most complete I have reviewed. English only… 49 pages long. Basically in detail providing everything needed to orient and assist setup of hearing aids for individual use. Diagrams are  used to show procedures. Explanation are given for both operation and expectation of user.  A large trouble shooting section is included that covers in depth. And…. If there are still questions SUPPORT Contact Information clearly shown.REVIEW USAGE….. The Hearing Amplifiers arrived partially charged.  They could be immediately used.  Tested for operation….both work.  REMOVE paper cover over charging contacts.  Placed on overnight charge although Manual states Full Charge can be attained in three (3) hours.  Light indicator on front of Charging/ Storage Case show status. Hearing Amplifiers as received had already installed tubes and tips.  I used these for test. Understand each individual is different and shape of ear along with fit affect final performance.  This is my experience. I found both devices amplified sound without squeal. I had to use the highest volume setting. There are FOUR MODES and for me the three bell mode worked best. I would have liked higher volume but absence of squeal ( feedback ) is a real plus.

88,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,very base quality,"while the fit is good, it does not provide the all day comfort like i hoped for. its not extended at all. capabilities are basic and honestly not that much better than my previous less expensive pair. they might look more fancy than they actually are."
88,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Works great,"This hearing aids is easy to use and is ready to use right out of the box. It has 4 preset programs already that you can choose from and is comfortable when wearing them. The box is portable and is in good shape and style. My only concern is it does not have the WIFI built in that you can connect to, so with this price that you get is just a basic hearing aids is more on the expensive side."

88,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Better Suited For Those Who Struggle With High Pitched Tones, But Noise Cancelling Isn’t The Best","This set of hearing aids arrived quickly and well packaged. The hearing aids are relatively easy to set up which is a plus. There are a variety of different sized attachments that allow you to find the right size for the best fit. This particular style has the gray piece sitting over/behind the ear, with the clear earbud going in the ear. I find this to be comfortable once you get used to it, and it is on the more discreet than some other styles. There are some features that I liked, first being the Bluetooth capabilities as it makes it easy to connect to your phone for calls or listening to music. I like that it has a convenient charging case. There are four preset modes to choose between based on the environment and preference. The issues I had with this particular hearing aid was that it mainly focused on the high pitched frequencies and over amplified them. There is a lack of noise cancelling to filter out background noise, but also the over amplification of high pitched frequencies tends to make everything become a mottled mess which is already what I deal with and defeats the purpose. These are helpful to a certain extent in limited noise situations, though I definitely found them ineffective when there was more noise/sounds occurring in my environment. I also found it rather odd that the charging case has to be plugged into the bottom, thus making it necessary to lay on its side in order to charge. This isn’t really an issue just a design flaw. The hearing aids didn’t have the best battery life prior to needing charged. If you are looking for a set that can last the entire day without charging, this is not it. The price point for this set is on the higher end for the capabilities. Overall, this is a decent set of hearing aids but struggle with noise cancellation and over amplification of certain tones which limits its effectiveness. Buyer would need to weigh the pros and cons to determine if this would be best suited for them."
88,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Rechargeable, comfortable tips.","Includes charging / storage case, several tips to get the right size for your ears. Has good sound quality, and several amplifications levels. They amplify everything including background noise. Ok for conversation or TV watching at home but wearing on the street made street noise uncomfortably loud. And will squeal if you get your hand to close, or when adjusting volume. Is a bit wide behind the ear and cause my ears to stick out."
88,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Nice quality sound amplifier with a good charging case and 4 sound profiles but background noise too,"This is a good way to amplify sounds, that will help most people hear more effectively. With a nice charging case, adjustable sound amplification and comfortable fit, this might be a good choice. Here are some of the things I’ve learned while owning it and things to consider before buying.I. Quality – They seem to be good quality that gets the job done and should last as long as the electronics survive. The case is also good quality without many features and an odd plug in choice, but it has a solid feel to it.II. Performance – The sound amplifying is very effective and gets louder than most people would need. There’s four different sound profiles to choose from to help you find a better fit for your particular needs. It seems to have a lot of background noise that can be distracting at times. They charge fast and the charge last for a good amount of time. They fit in my ears nicely and are minimally noticeable. The sound is a little like I’m in a hallway or a bathroom that kind of echo’s, but I notice that with all sound amplifiers. That being said, I have many cheaper OTC hearing aids and find these to be better than most and comfortable to wear.III. Consideration – The biggest consideration to me, is that even with four choices they still amplify more sounds then you probable need, because most people’s hearing loss is in certain tones, rather than across the board. These are a good alternative to the much more expensive ones that are dialed in to your specific hearing needs, but they can make things you hear well already, a little too loud in order to hear the things you can’t.Overall, these are a way to fill the void if this is all your budget can afford. They’ll definitely help most people hear the world around them with a good level of quality, and discreetness. I’ll be sure to update this review, if I ever start to have problems with it.You can trust that this review is simply my honest opinion that is attempting to provide you with helpful insight that I wish I had before I picked this product. Hopefully it was helpful in your decision."
88,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Work ok,"I had really high expectations for these hearing aids since they were $500, and they're ok for that price.  I know good ones are way more expensive than these.  I wanted these for watching TV as I have a problem hearing the voices over the other noise.  They did pretty good at that, and I would recommend for that.  Much more than that, and I would say probably not. The battery life isn't the best, so you really couldn't wear all day. They're ok for the price."
88,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Very nice OTC hearing aids,"I ordered these for my in-law who has mild to moderate hearing loss. He likes them a lot. They seem to perform better than his current OTC hearing aids. They are not pretty discreet and comfortable to put on. The sound quality seems very decent for a OTC model. He likes that they have physical program &volume controls rather than having to rely on some app to operate. They also have Bluetooth connectivity for streaming music and making/answering calls, which is handy.These come with a variety of ear domes and slim sound tubes to customize for the best fit. The rechargeable carrying case is convenient and handy. It comes with a USB charging cable and a power adapter. A cleaning tool and a measurement tool are also provided. The manual is pretty informative and easy to follow. The product packaging is sturdy and presentable.Overall, my in-law is pretty impressed with these OTC hearing aids. They are lightweight and comfortable to wear. They are easy to use and work better than the ones he has. They are usable without any apps, and can be paired with your phone for music and calls. The price is steep for a pair of OTC hearing aids but they are some of the best ones that he has tried so far. Worth a consideration. They get the job done for him."
88,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Comfortable, easy to set up but didn't meet my hearing needs","I had high hopes for these.  I've worn hearing aids for about 12 years.  My problem is distinguishing voices in noisy environments like busy restaurants or trade show floors for example.  The problem is compounded by having very sensitive hearing in quiet environments.  My original aids were about $4500 and did a good job.  I haven't needed them as much since retiring but they still work well when I do need them.Recent regulation changes have made OTC hearing aids available and I had hopes that some would come with with advanced signal processing like my originals.  I thought technology might have come a long way and down in price.  But these just didn't do the job for me.  Besides the missing voice discrimination I found the lower volume setting too loud.These are nice hearing aids.  They are comfortable to wear.  They hold a charge, they work with bluetooth, etc.  They have 4 programs - 1) is a basic amplification over the normal range (I found no reference to what the frequency range is), 2) is increased amplification for higher frequencies, 3) is increased amplification for lower frequencies and 4) is additional boost across the supported range.  If you're hearing needs fit within these set programs I think you'll like these hearing aids."
88,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Holds well in my ears, quality hearing aids","These over the ear hearing amplifiers hold well in my ears. The tubes have small retention plastic pieces that help hold the hearing aid dome securely in place. Holding the dome secure in the ear decreases static noises caused by an improper seal of dome to ear canal.These come with additional domes and hearing tubes which is a big advantage. It also comes with a 120 volt power supply that most hearing amplifiers do not include. It has a 50 page English detailed user manual ,USB cable, power supply, additional domes, additional tubes, cleaning tools , charging case and both left and right over the ear amplifiers.These amplifiers work right out of the box. They have saved programs and remember the last volume setting that it was set on when you took it out to charge it up. These work with blue tooth as well. The volume and program adjustments are made on the hearing amplifier rocker switches. The rocker switches have a good feel and appear to be a better switch than others I have tried.These are on a higher end price point compared to others but are a very nice quality hearing amplifier. Hearing aids are all different and have different options . In my opinion these are nice amplifiers and work well in my ears. Others may not have the same results depending upon ones hearing verse mine. I'm glad that I got these ."
88,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Works well, but I'm not sure well enough for the price tag.","So first things first, you will definitely get hearing assistance using these.  The level of amplification is really nice, and I can definitely hear much much better with this in compared to without them.  The charging is quick, and they hold a charge for quite a long time.  They're comfortable for the most part, although I do find that wearing them for extended periods of time starts to get uncomfortable eventually.  They're really not an all day aid in my opinion.  But for the most part they're really good.  I'm just not sure I'd buy into them at the price tag they're listed at.  So as far as functionality, they're awesome, but it's up to you to decide if that price tag is worth it for you."
88,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,GO Ultra hearing aids,"The GO Ultra hearing aids may be worth a look if you are trying out economical OTC hearing aids and prefer manual buttons on the device itself (meaning no app) to control things. It has basic functionality and a basic feature set and audio processing, and its operation is straightforward. The aids will also stream Bluetooth audio for music and calls. Although the aids are relatively bulky and considerably larger than any of my prescription aids, they fit comfortably behind and in the ear,  and provide some adjustment to fit different individuals.I have mild hearing loss in one ear and moderate loss in the other. I’ve been wearing prescription hearing aids for 8 years, and have also used Airpods Pro and many other Bluetooth wireless earbuds, as well as tried out  several PSAP hearing amplifiers. I’ve worn these hearing aids for about 20 hours so far and in a variety of situations, including a birthday party, walking on city sidewalks, driving, and quiet conversations, as well as streaming music and calls.In hearing aid mode, control of these closely resembles my old hearing aids, where a couple small buttons on each aid (independently) adjust each device. Each of the 4 small buttons can have  different modes, and each timed press has some sort of “beep” pattern as feedback. On paper, this is a simple and straightforward approach.  In practice, I would get pretty frustrated trying to find the correct small button (especially while walking) and pressing and timing accurately on my old hearing aids, and I have the same reaction with these Ultra aids. It can be somewhat awkward (especially for a lower-mobility older person), error-prone, and time-consuming.Audio performance in hearing aid mode seems fairly decent to me and about what one would expect. There are 4 user-selectable “programs” that boost high, low, or all frequencies. Overall, performance is a notch below the more expensive prescription aids and a notch above PSAPs. The overall impression is that all sounds are much “brighter” and even a bit startling sometimes. With my left ear (high amplification and closed dome, program 4) I am hearing high-pitched sounds at least as well as in my prescription aids, if not better. But low frequencies are lacking in all modes, as is effective noise suppression. Conversation in quiet environments was pretty intelligible without straining. . Wind noise was apparent when walking around, but somewhat controlled. Trying to follow conversation at the birthday party, however, was impossible – it felt like a flat wall of noises and extremely difficult to make out individual speakers and words. To be fair, though, restaurants and large gatherings are hard tests for any hearing aids, but more sophisticated aids can help a bit with sound processing to focus on following a conversation in noisy environments.In streaming mode, these appear to my iphone Bluetooth as earbuds (as distinct from hearing aids). They paired without problems, although it was confusing to figure out whether one needs to pair just one or both. Music quality is just OK. It’s intelligible, but “bright” and not full-bodied. It was fine listening to podcasts and audiobooks. I didn’t try answering any calls; see comments above about tiny buttons. I also didn’t try pairing it to more than one device.Other observations:The hearing aid receiver bodies are surprisingly large. GO Ultra is on the left in photo, next to my old Wix hearing aid.The hearing aid case is also surprisingly large and bulky.The amount of receiver feedback squeal I experienced was minimal compared to my other aids – which was welcome.The English user manual is excellent: well-written, clear, and understandable, with good diagrams.There is no active noise cancellation, it is always in transparency mode. Noise cancellation would have been a very welcome option in streaming mode.There is no replaceable wax guard, meaning ear wax will tend to  be moving from the dome directly into the receiver tube, leading to more frequent maintenance.There is no IPX water resistance standard mentioned, and in fact warnings in the manual against water contact.Bottom line: If you are fine with button-controlled hearing aids and a “bright” hearing field, you may  -- depending on their price at the moment --  want to give these a tryout.=========Side note -- if you are just starting out looking for aids for the first time, you'll often come across the expression "" fitting"" hearing aids. Before I got my first prescription aids  I thought this just meant adjustments to get a comfortable feeling while inserting and  wearing the aids; it does, but that is often actually a small part of fitting. Testing, trying out, and adjusting the aids in different situations can be a lengthy process in getting your hearing aids to address your own individual hearing loss. Fitting is something that often represents a large portion of the extra expense of getting prescription hearing aids, to compensate for the time and expertise of the prescriber. With over-the-counter (OTC) hearing aids like the GO Ultra, the user often self-fits the aids by trying different adjustments out over time, and in a variety of hearing situations.========="

88,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Earring aid,Sound good
88,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Successful Trial on a Senior Senior,"These seemed like a transitional hearing aid to me - halfway between the large over the ears style that our grandparents wore and modern, nearly undetectable ones.  The charge case is nice (no more batteries!) and the aids hold the charge well.  For me, with mild hearing loss, the sound was slightly echo-y.  However I tried these on my 91 year old mother and the she absolutely LOVES them!  They are comfortable in her ear, nearly invisible, are easily adjusted and helped her to hear better immediately.  She tried some hearing aids that resemble AirPods and much prefers these for the reasons mentioned and also because there’s no fear that they will fall out of her ear and get lost.  Highly recommended!!"
88,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Hearing aids that sound much better than alternatives I've tried,"These hearing amps sound much better than others I’ve used that are non-prescription. Their sound clarity is unparalleled. I also love that these have Bluetooth functionality allowing me to use my phone directly through them. They last all day for me on a single charge and there is enough charge to where if I forget to charge them one night, I still have enough for most of the next day. The noise reduction functionality doesn’t reduce sound quality as much as I noticed with cheaper models. Overall, these hearing amps are a quality non-prescription choice."
88,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Hearing Aids With Bluetooth Technology,"Per their website:These rechargeable, OTC hearing aids offer digital sound processing and advanced audio features that help you hear better wherever you go. Enjoy the convenience of hands-free, Bluetooth-streaming capabilities. Answer phone calls or listen to your favorite music and media, directly through your hearing aids.

88,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Probably the best you are going to get for the price,"Well packaged, instructions detailed and well written, all accessories included.  I used the measuring guide to get the proper tube length fit and it was right on. I put them in my ears and did not get any feed back or squealing. They are very comfortable and wearing all day should not be an issue.  I find the first setting to be the best all around for me. I found that in loud environments like a restaurant some conversation plays over others and a bit hard to discern. My hearing aid experience is limited  but I assume this is the case with all hearing aids in this price range. I will at some point go with a higher cost pair and get professionally fitted but for now these are great for my purposes.  For the price I don't think you can beat them."
88,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Simple to operate, costly, good value for money!","The best reviewer for these devices are seniors, and my mother did a good job as she was able to hear easily, the hearing aids' charge lasted for quite long, I think more than three days of continuous use without giving up still, and squealing wasn't an issue. The devices are small, sit behind the ears, which is something liked by her since she does not lose these while lying down on one side. Another perfect feature is the ability to allow and stream calls so connecting a phone to these tiny devices makes talking to someone over the phone easily."
88,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great hearing aid, but pricy","My father wears hearing aids for years and tested this hearing aid. Overall this is a great hearing aid for moderate hearing loss. The sound quality is great. The Bluetooth and music streaming feature is fantastic. It is great for senior people, as it sits behind the ears comfortably. It is ready to wear, just needs volume adjustment. It keeps the charge for very long hours, and can be recharged quickly with the case many times. Great quality hearing aid, but a bit pricy."

88,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Hearing aids not the greatest,Purchases hearing aids with the advertisement that there would be no whistling in your ears but that's not true not only is the whistle they rattle when you play music they rattle like something is broken on the inside so disappointed.
88,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Non Supportive,"I ordered these hearing aids for my sister, mistake I once again blew it and bought something from CHINA... the plug receptical is messed up on the charger so the hearing aids can't be charged up! Contacting their company to purchase a base and I'm told they don't sell the base but I could drop another $1000 and BUY another set of hearing aids!  Here's their customer service answer..  ""Thank you for your email.Unfortunately, we do not sell the case separately at this time. He would need to purchase a new pair of hearing aids.Regards, Go Hearing Aids"
88,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Make sure this fits your need to recover high-pitch sound,"Conclusion: This option is viable without getting a professional-grade hearing aid if you are looking for very discrete sound amplification. For most people, I don't see enough hearing improvement where I needed it to justify the cost. If you have hearing loss, I'd get a hearing test and let them advise you if this range or hearing aid is for you. The design is comfortable and not noticeable. I'll continue to test them in different settings, but I can't see wearing them regularly due to the sound profile described in the cons below. For someone with more moderate hearing loss, these could provide an affordable boost until you get a tuned, professional unit. I lost almost all bass and low-frequency sounds when using these, which my spouse does not lose with a professional hearing aid.Background for comparison:My primary use case is to amplify conversations and reduce distracting background noise to make up for a minor loss of hearing and a harder time focusing on the voices I'm trying to hear.I have low to moderate hearing loss in both ears and additional problems with fluid from allergies. I've used hearing protection and amplification devices ranging from $50 in-ear amplification to $150 Walker electronic ear protection. I asked my spouse to test the unit by replacing her professional ($8,000) hearing aid to verify my observations.Pros:Very light, compact, and discrete.The case charges the hearing aids without needing to be plugged in.There are four sound settings that provide a noticeable change in the tone profile and boost.It comes with several tubes and cones to fit your ear comfortably. It does take time to get used to them, but this is true for all hearing aids.They have enough sound amplification to boost hearing loss.They do an amazing job picking up nearby sounds, which is also a con below.I found that the music and lower frequency setting (profile 3) gave me the best sound quality and hearing improvement.It has a good sizing guide to help with a better and faster fit.Cons:This unit heavily favors higher-pitch sounds. It picks up nearby sounds surprisingly well, such as rustling, scratching, sliding, and similar background noises.I was not able to balance the volume to boost voices in the room and the TV without localized background noises being too loud and overwhelming.The boost of higher-pitch sounds was significant, but I lost almost all lower frequencies. If I took one unit out, I could hear a much wider range of sound.The boost of background and close proximity moise was very distracting. Even pitching up a remote was loud and blocked out other sounds.There is no app to control the sound profile or adapt to different locations.From the description, I was expecting much better noise cancellation. Instead, it seemed to boost background noise. The noise cancellation on my Anker earbuds ($50) and Microsoft Teams are significantly better.The storage box is big and poorly designed. The charging cord plugs into the bottom, meaning you have to turn the box on its side to charge. I can't understand this mistake.You get a variety of tubes and cones, but not for replacement. You will need to immediately order backups for your preferred size."
88,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,almost zero battery life,I bought these as a backup to my permanent hearing aids.  Battery does not last long enough to  use them.  Usually at 4 hours it  starts to say recharge.  They don't get frequent use since i have a primary pair but now only 1 will charge.  Not worth the money i paid
88,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Extra features,"I can connect these to my TV when I don't want to disturb my suite mates.  When walking, I can easily toggle between hearing mode and my audio books on my phone.  Easily connected to my iPad and my android phone too.I've tried a number of devices.These are AWESOME"
88,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth the price,"Loudness is not as good as the Lentorgi brand, which is $250 cheaper. I thought the more expensive Go Ultra would be better. Bad choice. i had to return the Lentorgi set, cause both hearing aids stop working after couple of days. I might have received a bad set.These Go Ultra sounds as if I'm inside a box. I'll keep these for back up and go back to the Hospital brand, since I lost those."
88,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Battery did not last,"Update, now the rt one won’t work and just screeches and I have made sure the tube is clear. I’m feeling like I wasted $600 after 9 months of use. —-liked these until month 9 when the left battery went bad. Only stays charged for about 4 hours without using the Bluetooth for streaming. Generally the battery for using as a hearing aide lasted 8-10 hours. On Bluetooth streaming music it only lasts 6 hours at most, even when new. I have emailed customer support as instructed and I had not received a reply in 2 weeks and I emailed again. No reply in a week after my hollow up. Disappointed as the warranty is to be for a year. I’m hoping to get this resolved before the warranty runs out."
88,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,The battery could be better.,Decent performing product but the battery life leaves a lot to be desired.
88,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,Screeching,I couldn’t get it to stop feedback and screeching. I am returning
117,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Finally! High Quality OTC hearing aids.,"On day 4 with these hearing aids.  Let me start that they have been superb thus far here's a short list of pros and cons:PROExtremely comfortable for all day wear.Battery life has been excellent.  Easily getting 16 hours a day with moderate streaming involved.Hearing aids are very effective at enhancing voices.  The initial setup process helps you dial them in really well but I would add that you might want to overshoot your settings just a little on The initial setup process.  Set these up just a little louder than you think you'll need and you'll be fine.  I went thru the setup process a second time because I didn't think the volume was as loud as I needed.Literally set and forget.  Unlike other hearing aids I have purchased I don't have to fiddle with these things constantly trying to tweak the sound.CONS:I wish the battery case contained a battery for ease of topping off during the day but, since the battery life has been so solid on these I guess I really don't need to and it's really not that big of a con.You'll want to balance the volume of the various sound profiles. Initially the Bluetooth volume was a little high so when my phone transitioned to Bluetooth background noise increased significantly.  But once you get that dialed in there's really not much difference between the two profiles volume wise.Bluetooth connectivity for streaming has been just a little sketchy.  This seems like it's prone to connecting and disconnecting when you first establish a stream.  However it seems to work itself out after a couple of minutes.  I don't know if it's a Bluetooth fault with earpieces or my phone.Fidelity is not at all what I expected from Sennheiser.  Yes I know the RIC earpieces are probably very small balanced armature drivers and I shouldn't expect much from them.  But have used used many Sennheiser products over the years and I just expected a little better sound.  They're perfectly adequate I just expected a little more.And that's pretty much it for these.  I am so glad I went ahead and spent the money on them..... you literally get what you pay for these days. That being said they sound better than my prescription hearing aids I got from Costco which I believe were phonak brands and considerably more expensive.  They  surpass the phonaks in ease of use and overall quality.Save up and buy them.  You won't be disappointed.Update... It turns out the Bluetooth difficulties I encountered were the fault of my phone.  I just purchased a new Samsung Galaxy s23 ultra and Bluetooth is flawless."
117,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent fit great sound quality,My All Day Clear hearing aids work great! I have to check occasionally to make sure they’re still on because they are so comfortable and the sound is natural. I love the live music setting also. Being a musician I appreciate the quality of the sound from my instrument as well as others when listening to a live performance. And I found out that we do have birds singing in our back yard!
117,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,A Game-Changer for Dad's Hearing!,"I got my 72-year-old dad the Sennheiser hearing aid, and oh boy, it's a total game-changer! Dad's been dealing with some hearing trouble for a while, but this device has turned things around big time.Being far away from him, I sent the aid his way, and he managed to set it up all by himself using YouTube. Easy peasy! Now, he's raving about how it's like night and day. In group chats, he used to miss out on voices, but not anymore. He's hearing everyone loud and clear, even when Mom calls him from another room.And let's talk about phone calls—total transformation! No more struggles during family calls or chatting with the grandkids. He catches every word crystal clear. Plus, he's rocking two phones, and guess what? The Sennheiser aid plays nice with both of them. Super convenient!The best part? He can now answer all his calls hassle-free. The headset is sleek and subtle, so he's not shouting to the world about his hearing aid. Dad's thrilled, and I bet this review will help someone else make a smart decision. Sennheiser, you nailed it!"
117,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,No help in a noiesy situation.,"In many ways these hearing aids are not bad. Good connection to the app. Good connection to cell phone. These amplify sound and have treble and bass control. The slim model fit well. But I own an old Bose hear-phone and for a lot less money the hear-phone is superior. Hear-phone looks very obvious and sadly it is no longer available. I will keep my old hear-phone as long as it works. Later I hope to find something which can focus sound source to reduce overall room noise even better than the hear-phone.Update 1/28/24TI have been using these for over two months now.  They are very much worth the money.  I use them all the time I use my computer or cell phone.  They are the best ""head phones"" that I have ever had.  And they also are hearing aids at the same time.  Comments above about noisy places still applies.  But I'll now increase my rating to 4 stars."
117,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent OTC hearing aids!!,"Prior to these hearing aids, I wore Phonak Virto B-Titanium IIC for the last 6 years.My audiologist recommended I move to an over the ear hearing aid as my Phonak was unable to correct hearing in my left ear.I have severe hearing loss in my left ear and moderate in my right ear.I decided to try these hearing aids but was worried it wouldn't help my left ear as they are listed for mild to moderate hearing loss.  These hearing aids are amazing and I hear better than ever. Technology is amazing in any type of situation you might find yourself in.  Background noise is not an issue with these hearing aids.If you are looking for a great pair of hearing aids at a good price, don't hesitate to try these!!!"
117,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wow! Sennheiser gets OTC hearing aids right!!,"I had Jabra hearing aids from Costco. They cost roughly twice what I paid for these.  It took a lot of effort and multiple visits to Costco to get them set up to where they were mostly OK. These took maybe 3 hours and I did it myself.  The sound is amazing.  I love music and now I can hear it again.  And the bluetooth actually works!  The Jabras would disconnect from my phone, first one ear then both. I couldn't take phone calls on the hearing aids. I couldn't listen to a book while walking with the phone in my back pocket, the sound would break up and be distorted. With the Sennheisers, the bluetooth streaming is flawless.  I bought these expecting that I would be returning them, I have been so disappointed by OTC hearing aids.  Until now.  I don't think I will be returning them after all.The app is decent but really needs a few changes.  For one thing, it should be possible to set up a profile using live sound instead of the pre-recorded voice talking.  When you go to edit a profile it should show you what the current values are rather than reset them each time.  Multiple profiles would really help too."
117,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent OTC Hearing Aids,"I have worn prescribed hearing aids for over 10 years. The last pair was made by Widex. I had constant problems with those and finally one of them quit working completely. I've tried two other OTC models, including the first ones Jabra put out. I was really hoping they would work. After wearing them a few hours, they became uncomfortable. They also had drop-out problems so I returned them. I've worn the Sennheiser for two weeks now and think they are better than prescribed hearing aids. They are more comfortable and I really like the rechargeable feature. The only option I wish they had was a quick way to turn them off. I discovered when placing them in the case, they are still connected, which drains the power if not plugged in. Very nice hearing aids! I hope the last a long time and I highly recommend them."

117,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Affordable good quality. Easy to use.,Quality for price. The quality is very good. I would like the app to have a better frequency adjustability. These are much more affordable and adequate than the $2500.00 per side from the local specialist. No waiting either. The next appointment locally is 10 weeks out.
117,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,disappointed,"The price of $1400 is very high for what it offers with one of $300. For those who need a Hearing Aid, hearing aid amplification is essential according to the Sennheiser All-Day Clear manual, this is left in the middle, simultaneous Bluetooth connection with a second device at the same time is not possible."

Contact phone number for seller was to a massage parlor, so could not contact seller for help. Took 4 days before I got a return address. The mailing label says I have to pay return postage and it doesn’t say which shipping service to use. This will be the first time I have ever had to pay to return something purchased through Amazon. Was really hoping these hearing aids would be as good as Sennheiser microphones. Guess I will never know and maybe a good thing with this type of customer service."

117,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,My dad has been enjoying them!!,"I ordered these hearing aids for my dad who has mild hearing loss. He was stoked to try them and see if they could help. The first thing he loved about them was the design and the way they look when he wears them. He says they aren't very noticeable like others he tried,  and he likes how discreet they are. He says they are very comfortable and fit in his ears well, he is able to wear them all day with no problem. They were simple to set up and installing the app on his phone was quick.  He is impressed with the sound quality as well, says they are loud, clear, and even sounding, and are definitelyan upgrade to his last pair. He enjoys that they have Bluetooth so he can listen to his music or answer phone calls hands free. Plus they have a long lasting battery, so he is able to use them most of the day without having to recharge. So far he really enjoys them and has had only minor sound issues, but for the most part they have been working great. He is happy since he can hear way better than before, so these hearing aids are truly an amazing gift for him."
117,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Work well and an excellent value,"My husband recently had one of his hearing aids fail and then not long after he misplaced one of them. Now, his hearing aids are prescription and cost thousands of dollars, so he was starting to look into OTC models because he wasn't sure he wanted to spend that much again, because OTC models are getting better and cheaper. Fortunately, the repair of the failing piece was only $200, and he found the missing one. But being without his hearing aids for a few days made him want to get some OTC hearing aids as a backup at the very least. Needless to say, he was super-excited to try these out -- and he really likes them. He says they are not as good as his high-end prescription hearing aids, but nevertheless very, very good and given how much cheaper the list price is, an excellent value given the quality.He was quickly able to fit and adjust them with the app -- he said the app is easy to follow and makes the manual unnecessary. The fit is comfortable and the sound is clear. Though he said in music mode the bass is weak. He doesn't like that the charger and the travel case are so large.From my point of view, they work well (he can hear me, and he doesn't have to blast the TV or radio or his video games). They look pretty good -- if you've got salt-and-pepper hair, the color blends well. The wire is a bit thicker and the piece that goes in the ear is a bit larger than his prescription hearing aids, but these are still pretty sleek looking and not that noticeable.In short, if you have mild to moderate hearing loss and can't afford or don't want to spend thousands of dollars for hearing aids, these are an excellent choice."
117,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Pretty good,"Maybe unfair, but I'm comparing these to my hearing aids I got at the audiologist for a lot more money.  I have an unusual low frequency hearing loss that is hard to adjust for.  I wanted to give these a shot to see if they were different than the others, as I am still having problems hearing.I had some trouble setting up the aids.  I tried multiple times, but the right aid connected immediately to my Pixel phone, but the left continued to fail.  So I called the support number, and surprisingly I got hold of someone who actually knew what they were doing, rather than a first-line support person reading from a script.  He correctly went right to the problem, that Pixel phones required a reboot to make the second aid connect.  Reboot, connected right up, and good to go.I have hearing test results, and I was hoping for a way to actually get into some precise adjustments.  However, all that is provided is a fairly generic 2-step process, one that adjusts volume, another for clarity, and that's all.  I was really disappointed it did not give me a way to fine-tune.Anyway, the test I chose was an online speech in noise test.  I honestly did not score very well even with my more expensive hearing aids.  But I was able to make out some of the spoken digits in the white noise.  With the Sennheisers, I could not hear the digits in the noise at all.  I was really disappointed.I still give 4 stars, as I think someone with more normal hearing loss would really benefit from these, and pay a lot less than at an audiologist.  They do seem to be very good quality."
117,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,So much I didn't even know I couldn't hear before,I've abused my ears for decades from working on jets to listening to heavy metal at top volume. I never really thought I had a problem with my hearing but have had difficulty understanding conversations at times and it seems to be more frequent. I had thought about trying some sort of hearing aid but never got around to it. Most are either very expensive from a hearing specialist or are just cheap amplifiers. I didn't know Sennheiser made OTC hearing aids but I have had experience with some of their higher end headphones so when I saw these I figured I could trust the quality and would give them a try.I went to their website first and ran the online hearing test twice. The first time I used a pair of Sony WH-1000XM4 headphones with noise cancelling turned off and connected to my iPhone and it said that I had mild hearing impairment. That didn't surprise me. But just to be safe I ran the same test on my laptop using a pair of Sony MDR-7506 headphones. This time it said I had good hearing. I know the wired headphones have better response than the wireless so your results may vary depnding on the quality of the device you use to test.After that I downloaded and ran the setup of the app. I didn't like having to install an app and create an account. I can excuse the app since there needs to be some way to tune/customize the aids but I don't see the need for creating a login. Once the account was created setup and pairing was relatively easy and it explained the settings pretty good. They inserted easily and I could tell the difference right away. I could turn the TV down quite a bit and hear it fine. But it was a bit odd because I could now hear the crickets outside clearly and also the cooling fan on my laptop.I normally don't like anything inserted in my ears. I have a high end set of UltraEars in-ear monitors and while they give me the best sound for music I can't wear them for long as my they start to itch and get sweaty so I normally use my cheaper over ear headphones for listening for any length of time. I can't use earbuds for the same reason. I kept the medium tips and they don't fit super tight so they were a bit more comfortable while still giving decent sound.I ran into one problem because I wear glasses and their earpieces rub on the top of the aids and gave me a bunch of noise whenever I moved around. I also noticed some crackling noise almost like crinkling paper or plastic when I moved around that seemed to be separate from what my glasses caused.I don't think I would ever use these for making phone calls. I did try listening to music through them just because I could but the sound quality was not good enough for me to ever attempt it again. I even tried adjusting the 3 band equalizer but it didn't really help much. I also noticed that when making adjustments in the app that the response was slow between making the adjustment and it taking effect in the aids so you have to slowly make an adjustment and wait to hear the results.Understand that I have never used any hearing aid before and have nothing to compare these to so this may all be normal. I'll keep wearing them for a while to see if I get used to them. They definitely make things clearer and I can hear things that I couldn't before. I may have to work with the settings too.
117,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Impressed by Quality of These OTC Hearing Aids!,"NOTE: I am a member of the Amazon Vine Program. I try out new products, and then provide an honest, unbiased review, based on my personal impressions and experience. I am not paid for my reviews.These hearing aids are so much more than I expected when I ordered them! They come well-packaged with detailed and user-friendly instructions for set up and to get you connected to the phone app that accompanies the device. Don't worry -- so far, I have only used the app for set up, so don't think you'll have to constantly be reaching for your phone to manage things all the time. In fact, you can easily control power and volume from the hearing aids themselves, and you can use the app pretty intuitively to fine tune high/low frequency levels and balance between left and right. There is an option you can turn on to automaticially reduce wind noise when you are outside. As you can see in a couple of the photos I have included with this review, they are equipped with signal lights to let you know when they are charging (orange) and/or have reached a full charge (green).The adaptive Bluetooth function works well with my iPhone, so now my hearing aids show up as an audio option when I make/receive calls or when I am listening to music or videos from my cell phone, and the sound quality has been great so far.  The adaptive Bluetooth function is an option that can be turned on or off in the app, if you don't want sounds from your phone to project directly to your hearing aids.  If you like this feature, however, you can actually connect to televisions, speakers, and other Bluetooth audio devices, as well, but I have not opted to do so and cannot comment on the quality of that function, other than it is presumably similar to using the Bluetooth connection to my phone.  The built-in microphones work well, too. They are positioned on the piece that fits inside your ear, so the only thing on the ear loop is basically the power/volume control buttons. Also comes with a selection of ear tips in three different sizes, a cleaning brush, and a generous supply of wax guards. I carry the lightweight portable carrying case in my purse now, so that I can easily store my hearing aids if I want/need to remove them while I am away from home.  The only thing I wish was different is the color of the ear pieces, which is black. Because these are not micro devices which can be hidden deep in your ear canal, you can see them, but it's even more apparent because of the black (vs. nude or beige) color of the ear pieces.Most importantly, the sound quality I am experiencing with these hearing aids has exceeded my expectations.  Indeed, it has taken me a little time to get used to hearing my own voice again, so I've appreciated the support documents and videos provided in the app that have very clearly addressed my questions about using these hearing aids so far. Not just the operational aspects about the devices themselves, but more general things like the new sounds I am hearing for the first time in a long time, and tips for adjusting to wearing hearing aids as a new user.For those without insurance, or who don't have thousands of dollars to spend on coinsurance, this is an excellent ""all-inclusive"" package that includes everything you need to wear and take care of your new hearing aids. Yes, it's still pricy, but at less than $1,000 for the pair (and everything that comes with them), the cost is nothing close to what I was being quoted in the hearing specialist's office, and considering the quality of the item I received, I find these devices to be an excellent value."
117,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Expensive but seen to work well,Picked this up for my dad whose hearing is going out. He’s refused to buy hearing aids because he doesn’t like how indiscreet many of them are. Luckily he agreed to try these out mainly because it was at no cost to him and it was from a reputable brand that he’s familiar with.He’s satisfied with the performance though he complains about a few random moments where they make high pitched whining noises. I think that might be a minor issue with the mics amplifying noise as he was able to make it happen by cupping his hands over his ears while the earpieces are in.He continues to use it but he’s now curious about the other model that goes further in the ear and makes it less obvious he’s wearing anything in his ear although the part that sits behind the ear is bulkier.I think this was a good introduction to hearing aids as the benefits for him outweigh his complaints.
117,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good sound but charging case has to be plugged in,"I have now been wearing my Sennheiser All-Day Clear Slim over the counter hearing aids for almost a month and while I like them a lot they can’t do everything the more expensive aids can do, and I am OK with that.  But there is still one thing that I miss.  Here are the pros and cons of a 20 year hearing aid user that has gone through several sets in that time.While for me this was a con for most it will not be an issue.  I have different hearing levels in the 2 ears, and I found in the app the ability to change the sound level between the 2 ears. I needed to reduce the sound in one ear but not the other and the app allowed me to do that.  It did warn me that the levels were significantly different, and I should check with a hearing specialist but allowed me to change them.  However, every time I used the hearing aids to listen to a pod cast via Bluetooth with my iPhone both ears would go back to the level of the loudest and this would be an issue suddenly for me.  For some reason the difference in sound level would not hold.  This is a temporary issue, but it was annoying that it would not stay where I set it.The rest of the pros and consPros – Good sound, this is obviously what everyone wants, and these hearing aids deliver. The size is ok for me and, longer and thinner, they fit well behind my ears with the wires being long enough to fit. You can change the in-ear piece to fit the size of your ear canal.  Different sizes are included. The set comes with a second traveling case different from the charging case, that is form fitted to protect them while they are off the ear and not charging. The price is right. Mic and speaker are both in your hearing aid. You can talk and listen within range of the Bluetooth connection to your smart phone.Cons – The app only gives you 2 choices for different sound settings, automatic and music. The equalizer is rudimentary, and I was not able to tell much difference when trying to use it.The biggest issue is the charging case must be plugged in to charge.  In today’s world, this could be a non-starter.  The fact that I have extra power banks laying around allows me to have a power bank stay with the charging case if I need to charge and can’t plug it into a wall outlet.  This is more often with my line of work than most I admit, but how much would that have set you back? Smartphone connection is, according to my wife, annoying since she hears an echo of herself when talking to me.  The only way to fix that is to stop using the hearing aids as the phone speaker and hold my phone to my ear or or turn on the speaker phone.  Other hearing aids with this capability allowed me to use the mic on the phone and listen through the aids. Putting the aids in the charging case to charge at night can be an issue as they must be firmly set in place and sometimes even reset 2, 3 or 4 times and then on 2 occasions one of them did not charge even though it appeared to be when I went to sleep. The charge is only good for about 12 hours.  I sometimes wear them for 14-16 hours at a time and they run out of charge before I am through.  This was about the same as my last pair so was not surprised but I was hoping for a bit longer.I would recommend them, but I would also recommend using a hearing professional and getting their advise as to what you should be buying based on your budget."
117,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,With a big selling price does have better audio but also some negatives,"At the time I received this, the seller's price was $1,000I am a 73-year-old male with hearing issuesI have tested 4 other OTC hearing aids from Amazon. They were only about $200 a pairWhere they worked they were not flawless as to quality of sound but better than using no hearing aids at allI expected as to the high cost of this hearing aid product to see a real big difference in sound quality and how they functionThis product does in fact have a better audio quality and helps in my case as my hearing in left ear is worse than right ear and this product allows adjusting volumes for 1 or both earsMost cases the sound is clear and not hearing any white or static noise, but in some cases like when in a room with no sound I can hear some noise and no setting other than reducing the volume level betters thisThis product to set up and use really requires you download from Apple or Goggle a cellphone APPNot until you go to install it you find to use this you must agree to allowing them to track you which i see no way they need to know your location just for hearing aids to function or know what else this APP is doing in the blindThe APP has no instructions, so you have to play with it and make judgements as to how to make the setting valid for your hearingThis APP connections to the hearing aids via Bluetooth, the more you have the 2 connected this way the quicker the aid's battery will dischargeThe aids are very small, about 1 inch long and very lightIt has only 1 switch/pushbutton for several different functions. There is no way with the size of aids installed behind the ear to use those, cannot see them, cannot even feel it, so I think all settings have to be done via the cellphone APP. But that means if you do not have the cellphone with you then of course cannot make changes without the APPI asked questions of the seller on their Amazon webpage, they have not repliedOne question is how long will the batteries last before having to be replaced and if I could buy and replace themBest I find in doing search on this produce is battery life is about 2 years or 500 plus chargesThis means for the $1,000 selling price after just 2 years you might not be able to get new batteries or someone to swap with the old onesI noticed in the manual as to operating conditions, it states functioning up to 70% humidity but where I live most of the year for weather daily goes to 100% and maybe lows in the 60-70% so do not know if that affects quality of sound and life of these aidsGoing to the maker's website for this product/model to find the charger requires a humidity filter installed, but the product does not come with one, and you have to buy those as an option, yet I could not find these on their websiteMy concern will be the life of the batteries, the quality of sound when batteries age and if even being able to get new batteries bought and installedLastly these hearing aids allow answering cellphone calls, but since cannot find/reach the button on aids than not a function for me and at least via the Bluetooth is allowing what most cellphones have is via Bluetooth is saying who the caller is to make a judgement to answer that callAlso, I have noticed when checking the cellphone when it was sitting on a table and I in another room, when a call was coming in the hearing aids did not beep to say call coming in and phone showed calls had come inAids do beep when cellphone is close by, so seems to say the Bluetooth receiver for these aids only have a short rangeOnly long term use will answer if these hearing aids are worth the $1,000 selling price"
117,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Works great but picks up all the background noise.,"It works well, the amplification seems to be good. You can adjust the volume as needed and they connect to my iPhone perfectly and I can listen to music. Needs a bit more bass though but still okay. It does pick up a bunch of background noise though but it's OTC and the price is way cheaper than what the doctors wanted to set me up with. So far, it's working well and I can hear much better. Just know it will pick up background noises also. A tiny bit uncomfortable after prolonged use though but it's still very doable, and for the price, It works."
117,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Sennheiser All-Day Clear - OTC Self-Fitting Hearing Aid,"So received these for review. I got them and charged them up and will try to give you as best a review as I can. As a person that hasn't used hearing aids before and considering how expensive they can be, I think these are a bit overpriced. Considering they are Sennheiser, I would think they would have more features and that everything would work as advertised.1. They absolutely don't provide the ability to hear just forward as many hearing aids do.I think much of that is due to design. Trying to get away from big ugly in ear models in favor of a reduced in ear footprint (which they do), I am sure had a lot to do with it. But with many companies supporting smaller and smaller in ear hear aids over the years, this seemed like a no, for back of the ear models.2. They are very light. I barely noticed wearing them, if it wasn't for my glasses I doubt I would give them any attention at all.3. Sound quality. Now here was not a deal breaker, but having owned Sennheiser products, I definitely expected better quality of sound. Highs, mid range and lows are just missing that crispness.  I guess the thought of the day at the time of making these was, ""Well they are hearing aids, not headphones"". Maybe they should of actually thought and built them like they were headphones. While definitely not horrible by any stretch, just expected more for the price. Hearing aids are a big and most times costly expense. To  put your name and not your best foot forward with these, seems a bit short sighted.All in all I would not say ""Don't buy these"". For someone that has major to severe hearing loss, and doesn't currently use a hearing aid, the entrance fee is lower than most, and I don't know that they would not find these absolutely great. I as having only mild hearing loss due to decades in heavy manufacturing, might find these a bit of a let down. I can still hear in most ranges, but at reduced distance. Most conversations in say a noisy restaurant are near impossible, these don't fix that. Their technology for whatever reason, is missing, and again I attribute that to design. But for less noisy environments, these work just fine, just don't expect binaural or stereo quality sound. Maybe next time add a equalizer to your app, as what is there doesn't do it, and would allow the user to adjust these more to what they expect, than expect and not get, and no way to compensate it.4. Battery life. I used these all day for 2 days, and nothing else while I was awake, and didn't charge them till the evening of the 2nd days. So about 16 hours, but they weren't dead, but about 20%. The one caveat I did have was, what to do if I forgot to charge, thinking as a person that has worse hearing issues than me. Well I suggest you don't forget as there are no spare batteries. So something to consider.All in all I gave them 4 stars, as they are useable, the Bluetooth worked great on a newish phone, and it worked with my windows computer (But in fairness, I usually use headphones, but you can't draw a conclusion without using them for that too). I use an android phone and no apple products, so I can't speak to whether they work with them.Buying hearing aids is a big decision, so please choose carefully. Best to talk to friends and people that use them, but don't solely rely on that either. Make sure they are of different brands, not what ARP is pushing this week. They really aren't a good shopping partner, when they are getting a cut of everything they advertise and sell to you. Talk about biased opinions. Find you a good Child or Grandchild that enjoys music to help you decide as well, then you will know what is good or not. Try before you buy is a great motto here."
117,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Takes getting used to,"Review: The Sennheiser All-Day Clear Slim OTC Self-Fitting Hearing Aid has been a game-changer for my mild to moderate hearing loss, offering all-day comfort and clear sound quality. The Bluetooth streaming feature allows me to seamlessly connect to my devices for enhanced listening experiences. FDA cleared and easy to self-fit, this hearing aid provides convenience and reliability for anyone seeking a discreet and effective solution for their hearing needs."
117,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Hear, here","So, since the FDA determined that hearing aids could be sold OTC there has been an influx of brands/sizes/shapes/ etc that resemb;e the cicada influxWith models priced anywhere from $30 to $1,000 or more/less, how do you decideMY advice (and I'm a patient, not a doctor) is: A) First GO TO an audiologist to determine your needB) Find a store that will let you try out a selection (not all that easy as these things DO go into one's ear) C) Look first to names you know (for instance Sennheiser) D) make sure you understand the ease/difficulties of getting the aids to function correctlyThese are pretty good, but they ARE more complex to adjust and they are NOT inexpensiveI WILL be trying them under a variety of circumstances  and if there's anything to report, i'll try to report it"
117,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent OTC hearing aids,"I have been alternating using these hearing aids with my prescription/audiologist pair that I have been using for two years (wearing hearing aids since 2017). Overall, the sound quality is excellent with these Sennheisers and comparable to my older ones that were six times the cost. They are easy to use immediately, charge up quickly and simply in their charging case, and easily stay charged for 18 hours. Electronic beeps and tones from appliances and live piano music sounds are often loud and distorted, but I have the same issue with the older ones. Unlike the more expensive pair, there are very few adjustments that can be made to correct or amplify certain tones. That is generally where the extra cost comes in, because I have an included-in-the-price-audiologist available as needed to make adjustments, which is NOT provided in the Over The Counter (OTC) hearing aids. I have experienced very little feedback/squeel when hugging someone or putting my hand near my ear, which can be common and annoying. Sennheiser is a respected name in the microphone/amplification industry for stage and recording and it shows here. The Bluetooth function for listening to streaming devices or cellphone works extremely well, better than my others. I got no distortion when I put my cell phone in my pocket and I’m listening to a podcast or music through the hearing aids. The Sennheisers have been durable, but I don’t know where to get them repaired when needed, also included in my more expensive pair. Overall, they function very well and are an excellent option if working with an audiologist is out of the question."
117,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Comfortable,"These are comfortable to wear, and the sound quality is fantastic. However, connecting them at first was a bit difficult to do. On top of that, I definitely don't think they are worth the cost they are going for."

117,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,OK,Pretty easy to set up but the fit does take some getting used to. It does make an improvement as I’m able to decipher people that talk soft as well as focus in noisy environments. They charge quickly and the battery lasts the day. I wish they were a bit smaller but other than that they are pretty good.
117,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Kind of difficult,While these seem to be well made but it's difficult to get them to sound right. When I walk into a room with a water feature these seem to boost the sound of the water above the sound of everything else. I'm still working on trying to get it all right but it isn't really easy. The quality of the sound is very high as fitting the Senseinheimer brand but I think having a professional set it up would be helpful as some of the instructions aren't very clear. I'll keep trying.
117,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Better than other OTC hearing aids,"I've used Sennheiser headphones and microphones for years, so I was interested in trying this product. But I was also wary, as Sennheiser was recently sold. After trying this product for a few weeks, my worry was unfounded.Unlike other brands I've tried (Eargo, Sony), this product was easier to set up and to isolate and amplify only the high frequencies I was missing. I tried the other brands first, as I wanted devices that fit completely in the ear canal. But the Sennheisers simply sound better and more natural after easy tweaking via the mobile app. (The app doesn't have what most of us want, the ability to adjust sound as easily as an equalizer provides. You just get basic tonal adjustments, which are insufficient, but better than other brands).The Sennheisers are not perfect, however. All that I've tried suffer from something I cannot stand: Anything with a sustained pitch (a single note being played or maintained in a music soundtrack for a few seconds, a human voice that drags out a sustained note for a moment, etc) is reproduced with a warble, where the pitch noticeably changes up and down just a bit. It's incredibly annoying, as I'm a musician. It renders sound unenjoyable for me. The cause: Manufacturers have installed software to help combat feedback, the squeal you often hear when someone inserts a hearing aid into their ear.Some manufacturers give you a user preference setting to turn off feedback control. Most do not. None of the over-the-counter brands I've tried, including Sennheiser, allow it to be turned off. I'd rather have occasional feedback than continual warbling of tones sustained for any duration. It's like a violin when a performer wiggles her fingers to add vibrato. The pitch oscillates. Sounds great in an orchestra, but not continually from a hearing aid.That said, the Sennheisers have produced zero feedback for me so far, whereas the others did nearly every time when inserting into the ear canal. And the Sennheiser's have the least oscillation to sustained tones. It's still unacceptable to my ear, but what are ya gonna do. I also need to hear better.While the Sennheisers are not invisible in the ear canal and instead are the old style that hangs off the back of the crease in your ear, they aren't as big nor visible as I expected. I don't wear glasses, but when donning sunglasses, the hearing aids are a bit uncomfortable. If I wore regular glasses, I'd need to go for the fully in canal aids.The charging case is simply a poor design. It's huge. The other brands have much smaller cases shaped to slide into your pocket. The Sennheiser case is built like a loaf of bread and it doesn't have to be. Eargo's includes a battery, so you can charge the case and then detach and use the case to recharge your hearing aids. The Sennheiser case is just a hold for the hearing aids that allows you to charge when the case is plugged in. Oddly, when you detach the case, the hearing aids automatically turn on. You won't likely notice this until you later open the case and find the no longer are fully charged. Really annoying and leaves you without hearing aids if you're out in the wild for the day. Other brands don't do that and let you recharge via the case.That said, it's all about the sound. Sennheiser wins, despite the aspects that need improvement.Highly recommended, but keep an eye on the OTC market, which will constantly evolve."
117,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Premium OTC hearing Aid,"Well built, and easy to setup. All day wear allows you to comfortably utilize them for up to 16hrs on a charge. The hearing aids are comfortable and lightweight, and come with multiple size of silicon inserts for an almost custom fit. Case is robust, and the BT streaming is seamless. Volume is good, some noise, but still adequate for low to mid hearing loss customers. Made in Vietnam."
117,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,OTC Hearing Aids,"These OTC hearing aids are well made, they're easy to operate and they come with an easy to navigate app. One thing I don't like about them is the fact that they connect to my phone's audio. I'd prefer they just amplify the sound coming from the phone, rather than connect through Bluetooth. Cuz I can get that effect with earbuds. And I could only wear them for about 30 minutes cuz it felt like they were tickling my ear. I thought that would go away, but it only got worse. So I can't really comment on the battery life."
117,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Exactly what she needed,"affordable. Sennheiser has an excellent reputation for audio equipment (headphones and microphones), so I thought this would be worth a try. Her comments:This one is perfect! The set up was very simple, as the app walked me though each step. In addition, the app includes tips on how to improve the usage of the product and how to adjust to wearing a hearing aid which I found to be extremely helpful.The All-Day Clear hearing aid connects quickly and easily and most importantly, it goes a long way toward improving my hearing. I work in a noisy classroom and often have trouble hearing what my students are saying, even when I get up close to them. Other hearing aids amplified all of the noise in the room, which did nothing to help hearing what I needed to. The clarity of the voices with this hearing aid is excellent, and background noises are kept to a minimum. This took some adjusting of the settings, but once set, the function of this hearing aid is wonderful.Other added niceties are the fact that the All-Day Clear connects through my phone so I don’t have to use additional head phones or earbuds; it also recharges easily in the case so I just put them in their case out at night and they are ready to go in the morning. I also like the fact that it is pretty small. I wear my hair very short, so it is visible, but small and discreet. With longer hair it would not be visible at all. The All-Day Clear comes with a variety of ear pieces to enable you to find the right fit; I found it to be a good fit and comfortable even when wearing throughout the work day.The function, ease and look of the All-Day Clear hearing aid are all more than satisfactory!"
117,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best hearing aid I've used.,"Wow, what a difference in noise cancellation of background noise compared to my $5000 dollar pair!  I can't believe the difference in these for $300 dollars.  They are easy to connect and are very comfortable.  I would actually take my other set out of my ears because they picked up all the noises around me and drove me crazy.  Not these, they are actually what they say they are, good quality with noise cancellation and comfortable!"
117,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sennheiser hearing aid,Premium OTC hearing aid. Very nice set with many features.
117,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,They make a difference!,"The Sennheiser All-Day Clear Self-Fitting Hearing Aid interacts well with the app and allows all adjustments to be made using the All-Day-Clear app.  They take some getting used to, however they work well in environments where external noise can be a distraction, or while watching TV, listening to conversation, etc.Setting them up is a breeze.  The app does most of the heavy lifting.  Listening to music, answering calls and speaking on the phone works well.My only real criticism with these would be that the case doesn’t have a built in battery.  You have to be connected to a power cord to recharge the hearing aids.  The charging cable is also a bit ‘old school’.  Rather than USB-C, it uses a micro USB cable to connect to the charging brick.  For the cost of these, the case should recharge the devices, similar to AirPods or Bose Quiet Comfort, but they are certainly comfortable, easy to set up and being over the counter available, can save you a costly trip to an audiologist.Pretty easy to recommend!"
117,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Compares favorably to a prescription set,"This is my second pair of hearing aids.  My first were over 4K list with an audiologist testing, fitting, and making adjustments, etc.The app on that pair was very sophisticated with multiple settings, etc.  But bottom line, while they were helpful, I could not tell that they made that much difference.  After a 60 day trial I returned them.  I simply could not justify the cost for the slight difference that they made.I decided to give these a try, based largely on the Sennheiser name and reputation, since I use their microphones and other equipment professionally.Imagine my surprise when I found that they worked just as well as the other set for a fraction of the cost.The app with this pair is, by comparison, very basic.  Only a couple of settings and the ability to fine tune is limited.That said, they compare very well on battery life and the fit and finish, being all but invisible to others unless they look for them.In addition, and not surprising, they are BETTER for streaming music via Bluetooth. That makes sense given Sennheiser's long experience in the sound industry.Like the expensive set I had, these still do not help that much when I'm in a crowd trying to hear one person with a high voice, but they  DO help and for the price, I'm glad I have them."
117,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice quality and comfortable hearing aides,"I was pleasantly surprised to see these OTC hearing aids on Amazon and decided to give them a try as my Wife has been encouraging me for a while to get evaluated for hearing aids.These are simple to setup, with an app to control the settings and a nice (although rather large) charging case.I have been wearing them for about a week so far and they make a big difference in my ability to hear people speak, as well as other noises I was unaware of before.So far I’m very happy with them and they are performing exceptionally well for me. I’ll update this review if there are any developments, but I’m optimistic they are going to make a positive difference! Recommend!"
117,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,I can't believe how well these work,"First things first, when the box arrives everything is so well engineered that just opening it you know that you are getting something special.  You are immediately introduced with the instructions, then the device is is the next piece, and there is a ""drawer"" that slides out and unfolds that contains the accessories such as a carrying case, ear wax removal tools and additional soft ear pieces.  At first it was difficult to figure out how to get them to function, you will need to download the app and everything worked perfect including the app which is half of the problem with devices that use apps as the primary control module.  I also love that they don't look like what you would think a hearing aid looks like, they actually look very modern and like you are wearing ear pods.  Yes it is very expensive, but worth the price for what you get."
117,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Dramatically better than my prescription hearing aids,"I've tried multiple hearing aid solutions from Amazon, and none of them were very good.  I eventually was able to get a set of prescription hearing aids from the VA, and while they were miles away better than anything I'd tried before, there were still some issues with the sound and functionality, but I was told that was just par for the course.  Turns out that wasn't true, because the Sennheiser hearing aids are fantastic.  The clarity of the audio is outstanding, and using the app, you can adjust your audio to boost the bass or treble.  That feature alone has made a massive difference in how well I can hear now.  The bluetooth connectivity is great, and I've kind of become an audiobook junkie because of it.  The battery lasts all day without any trouble (another big improvement over my old hearing aids), and they charge very quickly. These have become my new daily go-tos, and if you're on the fence about these, I'd recommend getting them."
117,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Rolls Royce of Hearing Aids,"The Sennheiser All-Day Clear - OTC is a very high end premium solution hearing aid.  It is made by the trusted brand Sennheiser and provides all day comfort in wearing.  The fit is universal amongst ear types with the in-ear bud easily maneuverable to seat inside your canal.  From there, you can also control the ADC1 will the abundance of controls to adjust according to your hearing needs.  The Sennheiser All-Day Clear - OTC is FDA cleared, very lightweight and secure in fit when placed behind your ear.  I was able to get up to 16 hours usage in my testing and all communications while wearing were clear and crisp.  This is a very high end premium priced hearing aid and you truly do get what you pay for in a comprehensive item.  I highly recommend this for purchase in your mild to moderate hearing aid solution."
117,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent Hearing Aid,"These are fantastic because they provide clear sound all day long. The Sennheiser All-Day Clear is easy to fit and comfortable to wear. Only downside is they are a bit expensive, but worth it for the quality."

This review is a Sennheiser All-Day Clear Slim Self-Fitting Hearing Aid.  They call them hearing aids, but if you continue reading about the product, they say they’re for mild to moderate hearing loss, which would describe them more accurately.  I have had a lot of different amplifiers in my day, and the biggest issues are usually the fit and I can hear my hair moving back and forth.  These are different, they’re lightweight, they fit around my smaller ears, the earpieces fit nicely, and I couldn’t hear my hair moving back and forth in front of them.  Something that’s cool is they automatically optimize the sounds around me, and what that means is they control the volume, and I don’t get blasted with sounds as I walk around the house.  Another plus is they connect to Bluetooth, so I can use them with my laptop, iPad, iPhone, and I can use the app to adjust settings while I wear them.  I like and recommend these amplifiers for all the above, and for the great clear sound."
117,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,The best hearing assistance,Sound is adjustable manually or through the app. App isn't necessary when wearing these and sound is clear. Charges quickly and comes with different sizes depending on size of ear for comfort and audio. Due to low hearing I used to talk louder than I needed too and now talk softly and I'm able to enjoy my music and talking with friends a lot more. This hearing device has many features to accommodate what a person needs to improve their hearing. It does connect easily with my phone when my signal is working properly.
117,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Rechargeable batteries,After doing a little research I ordered the all day clear hearing aids. They look to be a pretty good brand. The batteries are rechargeable and have a battery life of 16 hours. They are taking some time to get used to. I'm not used to having something stuck in my ears. It took some time to configure and get them adjusted to where they're working well for me. So far everything is working good with no complaints.
117,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Unbelievably high sound quality,"As someone who has been dealing with mild to moderate hearing loss, finding the right hearing aid has been a journey. As a music producer and DJ, I spent too many years listening to extremely loud music and it has taken it's toll on my hearing. I knew about Sennheiser since I have experience with their studio monitor headphones which were some of the best I've ever used. I first tried some lower budget hearing aids which turned out to be garbage. So I recently decided to try these Sennheiser All-Day Clear Slim, and I have to say, it's been a game-changer. The self-fitting feature made setup a breeze, and the slim design is comfortable for all-day wear. What really sets this hearing aid apart is its Bluetooth streaming capability, allowing me to seamlessly connect to my devices for crystal-clear audio. Whether I'm on a call or listening to music, the sound quality is top-notch. Plus, being FDA cleared gives me peace of mind knowing it meets rigorous safety standards. If you're looking for a hearing aid that combines comfort, clarity, and convenience, the Sennheiser All-Day Clear Slim is worth considering."
117,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Lives up to its name,Its a Sennheiser and the name speaks for itself . Got it for my elder in the house and she is so happy using it. Small enough and crystal clear sound. Comes with a charging cable/case and well packaged box with instruction manual. Easy to use too.Bit pricey but you wont regret!!
117,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent quality for OTC,These self-fitting hearing aids are excellent quality for OTC. Sound quality is great. Comfortable fit. Worth every penny. I recommend.
117,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,They are more than I expected ！！,"Product support, hearing aid performance, app ease-of-use… all exceeds my expectation!"
117,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great hearing aids,"These work great and feel great. They are very difficult to see and the battery life is pretty good. I love the Bluetooth features and I highly recommend these. These are about 1/6th the cost of the more expensive hearing aids, so they're a great value."
117,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,The clarity of the sound is great,"The media could not be loaded.
                



The pros are the sound clarity, and being able to control the hearing aids through the app. The fit is okay and I am able to wear the hearing aids all day with no problems.The cons are if you have small ears the appearance is not flattering. The travel case should be able to charge the hearing aids and carry the charging cord. The charging case that comes included is a little too bulky to travel with."
117,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love them!,"This is my second style of OTC hearing aids I have tried and I have quickly noticed some positive differences. The other set I have is more of a ""ear bud"" style which I did originally like because they looked like regular wireless ear buds and they were pretty small. However, battery life wasn't ideal for all day usage with those more of just a pop them in when there is a reason to hear better kind of set-up. Originally I was hesitant for this style thinking that they would be a little unsightly for my age bracket (sub 40 years old). While I probably wont be gaining any style points at the club these are barely noticeable and substantially more comfortable to use over the entire day. Having the wire go from the ear piece to the body behind the lobe provides good weight distribution and better comfort. I had no issues using the medium size ear insert that comes pre-installed but they do also include a small and large set for other ear shapes. These offer much better battery life than the ear bud style, I would imagine also being contributed to the design to allow more space for a larger battery. The charging case is pretty large and bulky, but it does use USB-C thankfully, they do also include USB-C cord as well. This is a huge necessity for me especially since I'm on the go a lot. I am able to get 12+ hours of use in on a single charge. Sound quality has been good, not very harsh in the way it amplifies and makes it easy to focus on voices and not flood you with background noise. Overall I have been very happy with these as finding something that fits well is extremely important for how good they will function. Sennheiser is a brand I have been familiar with and trust for quality, so far these hearing aids haven't disappointed yet. All in all I definitely recommend these hearing aids!"
117,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Work well for me,"I've needed hearing aids for quite a while.  I'm retired now and about half of my friends wear them.  Prescription hearing aids are very expensive.  I've resisted buying them because there are only some situations where I have problems, mostly parties and loud restaurants.  I'm reluctant to spend what a nice vacation costs just to find out if they work for me, especially since there isn't a way to try them out easily.  I normally get along pretty well.  Sometimes I have to ask people to repeat themselves, but I can watch TV, at least with my soundbar that has a setting for clear voice.  I've had professional hearing tests over the years and have been told I need hearing aids.  I've seen the audiogram as well, my hearing loss is real.The Sennheisers come across as truly professional.  Appearance wise they look the same as the prescription hearing aids my friends have.  They are quite inconspicuous, my wife didn't notice I was wearing them for several days.  The battery life is good, I typically wear them for 7 or 8 hours which runs the batteries down from full to about 45% or 50% so they should last through even a long day.  I wouldn't want hearing aids that aren't rechargeable.I was extremely impressed with the initial experience.  I charged them until the LED's turned green (about 2 hours).  They paired easily to the app (Samsung Galaxy), at least once I figured out that taking you have to take them out of the case to put them in pairing mode. They re-pair reliably whenever they aren't charging. The app is very simple, and has proved to be quite useful, although there are a few things I'd change.The most surprising thing was that they felt completely natural right away.  There hasn't been any squealing or feedback ever.  I've tried to trigger it with maximum gain and maximum EQ and they have never squealed. And they don't just make everything louder, there seems to be some processing that enhances intelligibility beyond just simple amplification.  Initially I wore them for my ordinary routine, watching TV, shopping etc.  They did improve TV sound intelligibility, and didn't get in the way or interfere with my normal routine.  I could hear lot of sounds I couldn't hear previously, especially high frequencies where I know I have the most hearing loss.  I probably won't wear them every day though, I get along pretty well and end up needing hearing protection rather than hearing aid when I'm in my workshop or using power tools, which I frequently do.The app is quite simple.  The main screen has a volume control that can be optionally split into Left and Right.  This is good for me since my left ear is much worse than my right.  This screen also shows the battery charge level for each hearing aid.  At the top there is a ""Sound Modes"" selector which allows only two modes, Automatic and Live music.  I would like to see more modes, especially a ""Party"" mode.  There is a button ""Fine Tune"" that opens up a 3 band equalizer and a toggle for ""Wind Noise Reduction"".The real test was dinner in a very loud restaurant with 5 other people.  While not perfect my ability to hear was much better than without the hearing aids, especially my left ear which is my bad ear.  I always split the volume control and have the left one or two steps higher than the right.  Watching TV or shopping the right is usually -2 and the Left -1, with the EQ flat.  In the loud restaurant I found that increasing the treble nearly to max, with the bass down and the mid up a bit made voices more clear.  I also had the volume nearly maxed out on the Left and a bit lower on the right.  They are directional, it helps a lot if I'm facing the person who is talking.There are some things I'd change if I could.The largest annoyance involves power on/off.  When the hearing aids are placed in the charger they disconnect from the phone.  But if the charger is unplugged they don't show as paired even though they are on.  The batteries will run down, so its necessary to turn them off manually each time unless they are actually charging.  It would be far better for them to detect the case regardless of charging mode.  The case is quite large given it doesn't have any real functionality other than holding the aids for charging.  I'd very much like it if it had its own battery, similar to most wireless ear buds.  This would make travel a lot easier and eliminate the on/off annoyance.Functionally I'd like it if the equalizer had another band, and if the left and right could be split like the volume.  I also like to save settings as a mode, for example the settings for the loud restaurant.Despite the things I'd change I still rate these as 5 stars because they work and work well.  I've tried two or three less expensive hearing amplifiers and OTC hearing aids that were completely useless.  The Sennheisers worked immediately and easily.  They definitely improve my hearing, especially in noisy rooms where I couldn't follow the conversation before.  Because of them I understand that hearing aids can work for me.  At some point I'll may want more but I'll know what I want and why.  It will be much easier to judge the value of spending more.  The Sennheisers would continue to be useful as a backup pair in that case.The Sennheisers aren't inexpensive but they are less than a quarter the price most if my friends have paid for their prescription hearing aids.  There may be less expensive OTC hearing aids that work OK, but the ones I've tried were terrible.  If my hearing loss gets worse I'll spend the money for the prescription hearing aids.  But I'm quite pleased with these for now."
117,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Decent sound, easy to use","These hearing aids took less than an hour to set up. You have to download an ap to your phone, then use it to set up the hearing aids. The ap is pretty simple and self-explanatory. There's an instruction booklet that you do have to read in order to be able to work all the features of the hearing aids and maintain them.These are the second set of OTC hearing aids I've tried. The first made things seem excessively scratchy and distorted, due to the way they handled high frequency sounds. For me, these Sennheisers took very little getting used to, and after a week or two all I noticed was that the sonic environment around me seemed richer and more interesting. My hearing loss is mostly in high frequencies, and I don't need much in terms of across-the-board amplification.Result? I can understand what people are saying better. I play bass in an orchestra, and from my spot in the back I was having difficulty understanding what the conductor was saying. That problem is mostly gone now. A few days ago I sat in a cafeteria with a couple of hundred high school students, and I had no difficulty understanding what my companion across the table was saying. Can I hear now with these hearing aids at 79 the way I did when I was 20? I don't think so, but this is a big step in the right direction.Cons: If you don't have a smartphone and aren't able to work slightly complicated ap's, these hearing aids are not for you. Returning to the ap after the initial setup I found a little confusing. The hearing aids have two tiny buttons, and you have to memorize what they do. Getting the buds into your ears and then getting the hearing aids in position behind your ears is a little awkward, but I guess this is the case with all hearing aids of this type. I have never tried the kind that just fit in your ear canal with nothing behind the ear. The 45-day free return period is shorter than some of the competition. These complaints are nothing that would reduce my 5-star rating.The bottom line is that these hearing aids work very nicely. I can't say what they would be like for other people with different kinds of hearing problems, but for me they are keepers."
117,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Easy to use/Works well,"On the slim model, the mics are in the in ear piece and work well.  You can dial up the bass, which adds alot to the enjoyment of blue-tooth music.  Also since I use eye glasses, the in-ear mics avoid the scratchy pickup from hair, etc when the mics are behind the ear on conventional hearing aids.  Battery works well and lasts all day for me.  Easy to set up, and adjust fine tuning of treble, mid-tone, and bass.  Connection to phone is solid. Phone app is simple and works well. Good value for the money for someone with mild hearing loss and looking for a likely OTC hearing aid."

117,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,I highly recommend the All-Day Clear Slim,"I was on the hunt for new hearing aids that had to check a few boxes and these do it all very well!- Full Android integration- Rechargeable- Quick and easy setup- Application easy to use- All-day comfortI highly recommend the All-Day Clear Slim.The first draw for me was full Android integration, no holding my phone up to speak into as with other brands, these have microphones built into the earbud style receiver and the audio is crisp and clear for in-person conversation and Bluetooth streaming.I really like the form factor too, the Slim version tucks behind my ear very well with or without my glasses, the slightly larger wire feels more durable than others I've used, these seem to have a bit more deeper (less tinny) tone than others I've used, and the larger earbud-style in-ear receiver is stout and very comfortable for all day long usage. This style feels much more natural to me with less of a plugged ear feel than the smaller ones I've used before.I've had store bought HA's with custom programming which is nice for people who need it or don't know what to expect or understand about getting used to integrating any HA's into their life. If you're patient and have an understanding of the adjustment period of getting used to HA's then these are a great contender for the over-the-counter (OTC) market.I really like the application and setup of these, it's quick and simple for do-it-yourself at home and gives you some simple adjustments. After the quick initial profile setup be sure to adjust the EQ to ensure these are really dialed in for you. Alternatively, you can pay for the additional in-office service they offer through a network of providers, make note that network isn't huge so be sure to check their website for details if that is something you need/want. Also, purchasing that extra service extends your warranty by another year too.I really like these are rechargeable and last all day. The only thing I dislike is the charging case itself. It's very large and only works when plugged into the wall. The case doesn't have an internal battery to allow additional charging on the go. These HA's do last all day so probably isn't a big deal for most but the ability to travel over a weekend with a smaller recharging case would have been perfect for me. The Slims also come with an additional small non-charging storage case which is nice."
117,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good OTC hearing aids, missing some ""higher end"" features","Setup was straight forward.  Bluetooth connection to my phone (Android) and laptop  (Windows 11) was not a problem.  Button controls work but the timing seems longer than the manual states: it takes 6 seconds to turn the devices off while the manual says 4 seconds.  Not a big deal.  Sound amplification is clear, I can hear things I haven't heard since my last hearing aids died.So, what's missing?There are only 3 bands for adjustment: bass, mid and treble.  10 or more bands would enable the hearing  aids to be better adjusted to individual needs.  Increasing the treble helped for my high frequency issues and the midrange helped for consonants (""fifty"" can be distinguished from ""sixty"").  Finer adjustments  would be more helpful.There is no ""automatic noise canceling"" feature which would make the hearing aids more useful in noisy environments.  I'll be using them on a long flight in a few weeks and I'm afraid they will pickup all the airplane noises.  Setting the hearing aids to ""automatic"" and letting music play via Bluetooth should stop the noise amplification.There are no directional controls: you can't tell the hearing aids to ignore sound behind you and emphasize sound in front of you (helpful for TV or movies that don't have surround sound, or in a noisy restaurant).When compared to my previous hearing aids ($6400 and needed frequent repair/replacement during 3 year warranty, then became unusable after the warranty expired) these are a good alternative ($1000).  Time will tell how long they will work.  With any luck, the next replacement will be to upgrade to better features not replace unusable devices."
117,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Surprisingly good for an OTC and for the price!,"I acquired this hearing aids as part of a campaign from #Reviewclub.I needed to buy these ones twice because Amazon sent me laundry product instead of the HAs due to a problem in their warehouse and still waiting for my refund (I will update my review if I don't receive my refund).As a prescription hearing aids user since 2019, My goal is to find a better option for much less price as second or emergency HAs, but surprisingly I can say I can use these ones as primary ones.PROS- Sound quality is exceptional. Including bluetooth audio streaming for phone calls and music from the phone (iphone user). Comparable with my ReSound same RIC style) and Starkey ITE I have. Obviously you won't have the bass as earbuds because the dome. Also the mic sound for phone calls and bluetooth distance range are really good.- Customizable by your own on 3 easy steps thru the app. The app plays a conversation streaming to the HAs and you select the clarity and volume level that fits you and that's it.- App usability, very simple and easy. You can adjust volume and Equalize bass, Mid and Treble. Also activate wind noise reduction.- Noise reduction, I didn't detect yet bad things here. They  work very well doing it automatically.- Battery, surprisingly last more than my day entire day, sometimes I don't charge them at night and last till next mid day.CONS- You are not able to upload your own custom hearing profile from your audiologist. And the option for 250usd is not available because there is no audiologist in my area, which is odd not having one in Clarlotte NC area.- Domes. 3 domes size are delivered. The best sound is the bigger dome but I got occlusion effect (you hear your own voice and body internal sound louder) but you get the best sound in terms of clarity and bass. I needed to change to a smaller one to avoid occlusion effect but loosing the full benefit.- Sound Profiles, You can only select 2 profiles: Automatic and Live Music. And you can't create your own sound profiles in the app.- With the app you can't customize other advanced settings that are available for prescription HAs. Like AI or focused on any direction.- The charger need to be connected to the power. I have seen others with battery to recharge it giving you flexibility.- Sometimes if you are using your phone for music or videos, the phone automatically change the sound output to the HAs automatically. There is no way to configure this behavior, you need to shutdown the Bluetooth.Overall these OTCs are really good and at good price. I would ask for a little discounted price just because you can't upload your own hearing profile and need to pay for it going to an specific audiologist when you could do it by your own thru the app.  Otherwise I can live with these for daily use and replace my prescription ones entirely."
117,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Big Disappointment!,"I was really looking forward to using these hearing aids. Got them delivered today, charged them for the required three hours, the green lights lit up, put them in my ears and nothing! Dead silence regardless of what I did with the buttons! I’ll definitely be sending these back!"
117,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,I like the way it looks on me,"The All-Day Clear App was easy to download and use. The hearing aids fits well and the appearance looks nice. Some of the features I to get use to, like to increase volume you have to quickly press the push button on the right hearing and to decrease you have to quickly press the push button on the left hearing aid. The sound is clear and overall I like the hearing aids."
117,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,I would definitely purchase again,"I researched many brands of hearing aids before deciding to try these Sennheiser All-Day Clear.  I decided on Sennheiser because they are owned by Sonova who also owns Phonak (a well know hearing aide brand).  The day I received the hearing aids, I first charged them for about 2 hours.  They came with a slight charge, so it didn’t take long before they were ready to try.  I downloaded the All-Day Clear app and followed the easy prompts to configure them.  The hearing aids come with 3 sizes of rubber tips and the medium size is pre-installed.  I used the small size which fit perfectly in my ears.  They also come with  replacement wax guards to help keep wax from clogging and affecting the hearing aids.  At first, it took a few tries of putting on the hearing aids to get a good seal inside my ear.The app: the app walks you through each step: connecting them through Bluetooth, setting the volume for both left and right ears, and frequency adjustments.  It took about 20 minutes to fully set-up.  Once configured, you can adjust the volume of each individual hearing aid or both together.  You can also turn on or off the wind noise reduction setting and change the sound mode selection.  It took a few days to get used to how well the hearing aids work, and I would make small adjustments within the app to change the volume depending on the ambient noise around me.The hearing aids: These hearing aids are very small and discreet.  I will reemphasis, very small.  So small that I’ve had multiple people notice I’m able to hear them much better and clearer, they’ve asked me if I was wearing hearing aids because they couldn’t see any.  They are very light weight also.  Once I figured out the proper way to insert the earpiece in my ear canal, I forget I’m wearing them.  These take about 4 hours to fully charge when the battery is depleted but last all day.  I have not had to remove and charge them during the day.  The Bluetooth feature has worked flawlessly with my iPhone.  I can clearly hear the person on the other end and they can clearly hear me.  It’s very convenient to make and receive calls without having to hold my phone to my ear or use the speaker phone.The charging case:  The charging case is much larger than necessary.  One good thing about the size, it’s hard to misplace it.  The hearing aids come pre-installed in ear charging port but not fully charged.  To charge, simply plug the case into the included USB cable and wall wart and place the hearing aids in each charging port.  You can charge them with the lid open or closed.  I usually charge them with the lid open so I can see the charge status.  The case does not have an exterior charge status.  The hearing aids will show charge status through a light on each one.  Once charged, the hearing aids will have a solid green light on each one.  One important note, if you remove the USB cable from the case, the hearing aids will automatically power on.  You can turn them off by pressing and holding the button on each aid for 4 seconds until the light turns red.I highly recommend these hearing aids for anyone with hearing loss.  These hearing aids are not inexpensive but thousands less than purchasing through an audiologist.  I didn’t realize how bad my hearing had become till the purchased these.  They have made a world of difference."
117,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Effective but not efficient,"First off, the unboxing was simple and standard.  The box was secure and well-packaged.  It comes with a Type-C to attach to the base for charging, and a separate travel case.  The app was easy to download and pair the aids.  On to the good vs. bad-The good was sound quality.  They paired with an apple device and worked relatively seamlessly.  Some times it wouldn't connect and on their own, with normal handset use, they did not amplify sound.  The true bad, and real disappointment was size and fit.  They proved to be uncomfortable after a short time, and were more bulky than a similarly priced brand.  Unfortunately, they will get limited use.  For the price, they should be thinner, and more secure-this was using the smallest available mold."

117,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Old tech, weak app, terrible in noisy environments, and overpriced.","There is good and bad to these, but since you probably most need to know the downsides, I'll start there.1. These seem to be based on very old tech from the Phonak Marvel range of hearing aids.  That puts them two generations behind current hearing aids.  (Phonak and Sennheiser hearing aids come from the same parent company.)  So you are spending a hefty chunk of money for very old technology.2. These perform very poorly in noisy environments, such as restaurants.  That's especially true if they have music playing.  The Sennheisers amplify everything, including the music coming from behind me and the guy talking loudly two tables over and a little behind me.3. No front-focus or restaurant mode.  The app is so limited and restricted that you only have two settings: automatic and music.  There is no way to control the focus of the sound to only amplify what is in front of you.  That is a common and very important feature in hearing aids and to see it missing here is baffling.  The automatic mode does not work well enough to do without this.4. Lots of hiss / floor noise, especially in quiet environments.  I find I have to turn these down quite a bit to get the hiss to a tolerable level when at home with my spouse.  A little hiss is not uncommon for hearing aids, but this seems much more than it should be.5. Professional programming upsell is expensive and not refundable.  They charge you $250 to have a professional program these for you and that is not refundable.  It's a huge gamble to take if you find these insufficient right out of the box.6. There are MUCH better values out there for only a little more.  Most important is the Jabra Pro 20 and Philips 9040 (soon 9050) hearing aids from Costco.  Those will run a few hundred more than the Sennheisers, but they are current tech (especially the Jabras), come with professional programming and fitting, a free hearing test, excellent support, cleaning and maintenance accessories, a great warranty, and more. And everything is included with the price of their hearing aids, and it is fully refundable with a pretty long trial / refund period.  Even with the cost of 60 for a Costco membership, it's a much better value.6. No options for longer receiver cables.  The main part of the device sits behind the ear, with a thin cable that goes to the receiver inside your ear canal.  The problem for me and a good number of other people is that the cable is sometimes too short and the hearing aid ends up sitting high on the ear, being very visible, or the cord won't sit flat against the face.  That also makes it harder to wear glasses.  Another reason to opt for a professional fitting at Costco or a similar place.However, there are some good things about these that set them apart:1. Bluetooth classic connectivity.  Most hearing aids still need an adapter to connect to Windows computers and other classic bluetooth devices.  That's changing, but right now Phonak / Sennheiser is about the only brand of hearing aid that has strong bluetooth connectivity to Windows devices.  They also work well with older Android devices.  Note that this makes no difference to iPhone and M-processor Mac users, nor people with the newest Samsung devices, but for others it may matter.  Adapters for other hearing aids to connect to Windows machines can be had for ~40 used up to 300 new.2. Good battery life.  I never ran these down below 30%, even wearing them for 17+ hours straight with a few hours of streaming in the mix.3. Build quality seems solid.  No complaints at all.  The device appears to be made well, even if it is old tech.4. Pretty natural sound.  The sound quality is pretty good and the sound around me seems quite natural.  The streaming quality isn't the best, but that is pretty much always true of hearing aids.For me, personally, these are just not worth the price when I can get something so much better from Costco.  I am returning these and will get the Jabra Pro 20s instead.  It will cost me 600 more, but consider it would cost 250 more to get the Sennheisers properly programmed and maybe get longer receiver cables, and even then I would be using older tech, I just can't justify keeping these.  They were a real disappointment, especially given the strengths of the Sonova/Phonak brands and the premium Sennheiser name.  In the end, these fail to live up to any of those brands' reputations and, ultimately, make me less likely to look at their hearing aids in the future."
117,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Rivals more expensive Rx Hearing Instruments,"What an exceptional product. Comfortable to wear for long periods, helpful in short bursts, battery life is plentiful, and the build material rivals professional instruments. The app is easy to set up and use, and the sound quality is exceptional for mild loss, especially in those hard-to-hear environments. A+ from me. I also purchased the other style variant, which is top-notch."
165,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good for the price,"Bought these lil dudes and they worked great.  They fit just fine, didn't feel weird or heavy.  I returned them because one started making a sound that couldn't figure out what it was but it was the device itself.  Plus the battery life started getting shorter and shorter."
165,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great aids,"They help a lot, but they say background noise canceling, I thought that wasn't correct, but after talking to the company,  I was missing some information and now I'm super pleased with the noise canceling feature"
165,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Rice, good rice",Great for the money cooks up well last a long time the size
165,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Good, Dependable Product with Reliable Performance","These hearing aids have been purchased on behalf of my mother. Based on previous Amazon reviews, I felt reasonably confident moving forward with the purchase. The packaging and instructions were clear and concise. The online videos pertaining to daily use and periodic cleaning have been most helpful. Upon initial insertion of the first hearing aid, I witnessed an immediate smile appear on my mother's face. Her  ability to hear has improved greatly. I am now able to speak to her at distances of 15 to 20 feet or greater. Prior to wearing the hearing aids, this was not a possibility. She has been wearing the hearing aids for approximately one week. So far, no complaints or issues have arisen."
165,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Almost invisible,"Has improved my husband's ability to hear, almost invisible"
165,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,It works,"I got this for my father, we just got it for 2 days and we are still trying it out, it fits comfortably, not too visible. My father said he can hear better, especially his own voice. Hopefully it will last for a while."
165,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Perfect for my mom, exceeds expectation",These have been a huge help for mom.  She's in a nursing home setting and these have made hearing so much better for her (and her roommate).  My husband had $5000 hearing aids but they were so problematic.  He put these in and was amazed at the sound quality.  I am ording a pair for him today.  Highly recommend!!!
165,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,These Hearing Aids Really Work,"My nearly deaf 97 yr. old mother bought the Earcentric hearing aids because her expensive Phonak hearing aids just do not work no matter how many times she had them adjusted. The great reviews, low price, and easy returns for the Earcentric Hearing Aids made it an easy choice for OTC hearing aids.  It was the right choice.  Installing the hearing aids was easy and as soon as they were in her ears, she could actually hear.  We watched the news together and the TV sound did not have to be on blast volume.  The next day I installed the Volume Booster kit on her hearing aids and she could actually hear someone knocking on her door, a sound she has not heard in years.  A big thank you to Earcentric for having my mother join the hearing world again!"
165,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Works well,"It works much better than expected.  Setting for restaurants helps.  Not like $5,000.00 hearing aids, but I'm very happy with my purchase."
165,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,I appreciate the creators very very much!!!!,"I don’t normally take the time to write ✍️ a review. Every now & then that’s about it! My hearing 👂🏾 has affected me a lot in the past. It took me some time to accept it. I have now matured & have accepted any flaws (& KICKED THE EGO). God is AMAZING!!!! I’m very GRATEFUL!!!! Now I’m making life better! I read reviews & also had my sister view so she can give me her feedback. WE SAID IT A GO!!!! My sister exact words was, “They will work for you too!!!!” 🥰…. I am one day number 3. I fell asleep in them last night (I know 👀It won’t happen again)! But listen!!!! They was still working lol 😂 (LONG CHARGE LIFE). I wore them all day that day. I can hear very clearly! It will take time to adjust to your surroundings. I took the time to leave this review, because if it mattered this much to me it matters this much to you!"
165,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Comfortable, effective sound quality, easy to adjust, and rechargable.","My hearing needs some boosting which these aids do very effectively.  My hearing is such that in group settings I miss about fifty percent of conversation often asking for repeats. I can hear about half the people well enough who tend to speak with clear diction and good projection. The rest, to varying degrees, fade into muffled obscurity. I've tried a few different aids over the last couple years with no success mostly because they sound like a radios from the 1940's to where everything sounds crappy.  These EarCentric EasyCharge Rechargable Hearing Aids work very well.  They came with clear instructions and valuable educational material on how to implement.  I put them on in the morning and remove them to the charger in the evening, wearing them an average of 10 hours daily. They were very easy to adjust to and hearing is beginning to sound normal. I am not aware that I am wearing them until I reach to scratch my ear, then its, ""oh, I have my aids in"". I highly recommend this product."
165,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,They actually work!,"My dad is EXTREMELY hard of hearing. 5 years ago I took him to a hearing aid specialist and we spent 7k on hearing aids. They only lasted 3 years before the place was trying to sell him on a new pair.He put these on and said it sounded like I was shouting(normal for new users)! I was so thankful they worked!! ❤️ He’s been using them and they are easy to put in, have good instructions for use and cleaning, are rechargeable, don’t interfere with his oxygen, and are a good size. Even if they went bad every year, we’d spend less than going to a professional place. We are so thankful for these. It is a blessing! Not to mention that cognitively, mental clarity improves when you can hear properly. We are impressed. If you are hesitating, give them a try. You can return for 30 days(at least when we purchased them)."
165,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Pretty Good Hearing Device For The Cost - But Be Careful,"These are obviously much less expensive than many such devices and around 1/10 of the cost from an audiologist (including their fees). I have some significant loss in the upper frequency’s of my hearing. I am male, age 72 - It’s about typical. It means that high voiced, soft spoken female speakers are hard to understand, especially if there is a noise like the TV on.The Good:The sound quality is pretty good and the noise level isn’t objectionable.I can better understand people’s voices with these.They are relatively easy to set up and control - There are few settings.Although, as you would expect the high (treble) notes are accentuated, music is still enjoyable - the bass notes still come through.I still have decent directionality of my hearing - I can tell what direction the sounds I hear are coming from.The Bad:The default earpieces (red card photo) are small and the tube it attaches to is very small. I had used these a few weeks and one night on taking off my hearing devices, one of the little silicone ear buds that goes into the ear canal came off and stayed in the ear canal. Perhaps I pushed it in too far. In any case I couldn’t get it out, nor could my wife see it. I had to go to an urgent care facility the next morning to have it removed from my ear. While I admit I may have inserted the bud too far into my ear canal, this was kind of scary until it was removed. The root problem seems to me that the default earbud needs to be in fairly deeply to work well, but it can go in easier that it comes out if you go in too far.After I had the ear bud removed, I waited a day and then used the larger tubes and earpieces (yellow background photo) that also come with the device (aparantly for those with more serious hearing loss). These have the advantages of an ear bud that doesn’t have to go all the way into the ear canal to get decent results and the tubes are bigger and easier to work with. (By the way a common pipe cleaner does a good job of cleaning out these tubes).After changing over to the larger earpiece tubes and buds, the devices are a bit more visible than with the default tiny tubes, but it looks to me like hopefully I won’t have to take another trip to the urgent care facility again to get the bud removed from my ear canal.By the way - earwax can be a problem with any hearing device. I carefully clean my ears every night with a Q-Tip (be very cautious) and even so, a little earwax can get into the earbud and tubes and if it does, it will block the sound - especially with the default tiny tubes unless you clean them daily.Update ~ 1 1/2 years Later:I have had no real problems with these since I switched over to the larger hearing tubes and earbuds. They work and are simple to use. I have wanted a Bluetooth version like this and have tried a couple of competing products with Bluetooth. I wanted that to be able to listen directly to my phone for calls or music and to be able to set up the hearing aid response via Bluetooth. One worked pretty well aside from sounding bad on music from my phone (no bass at all) and physically hurt my ear at the end of the day because the shape was not adjustable.  The other one didn't work at all to receive Bluetooth audio from my phone and was comfortable enough but because it didn't really fit properly it was prone to squeals (feedback). Compared to those, these hearing aids are great - No Bluetooth but they just work. This has caused me to raise my review by 1 star. Having 3 buttons instead a miserable single button makes them much easier to adjust (On/OFF and Up/Down Volume)The battery life continues to be good. It recharges in an hour or two and I I use it all day and into the evening with no issues.By the way, the larger tubes are 2mm ID X 3mm OD and Amazon sells those cheaply in both silicone and PVC tubing. The earbuds are pretty much standard and Amazon sells those too. Those simple little tubes that go to your earbud allow you to adjust the spacing to your ear canal from your outer ear for your particulars ears. Being able to use a variety of earbuds lets you find a size and style that works best for you. If this manufacturer made a version like this with Bluetooth I would buy them in a heartbeat.And, BTW - When I want to read I just turn off the hearing aids. I think my grandad did that when he was tired of hearing grandma. It is not complete silence but it's a feature."
165,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,these units work as advertized at a great price.,"This is my third set of hearing aids that I purchased.  I am a very skeletal person and did not want to spend a lot of money on units that would not work as advertised. Let me say these units are outstanding.  The sound is great, no whistling, easily adjustable and they perform all day on a single charge.  They are so good that I sent the link to purchase to my brother in California.  EarCentric - good job!"
165,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Comfortable and good quality.,"I have moderate to severe hearing loss this year with ringing noise in both ears. My family is tired of me saying WHAT, HUH, I CAN'T HEAR YOU. After having the hearing test, Dr. said I was in denial.So I bought this item just to get everyone to stop. Directions are pretty simple. Placing them in my ear was pretty easy too. A few adjustments hear and there. I was shocked about this whole hearing thing and then after wearing them a few hours around the house I took them off and I felt like I was back in a tunnel and could hear the ringing again.  These hearing aids are really nice. I couldn't belive it. They really did improve my hearing. I recommend these. I bought the silver. You can't even see them in my ear.Thumbs up on this product."
165,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Affordable and Effective,"As someone who has been struggling with hearing loss for a while, I was hesitant to invest in a hearing aid, especially at a lower price point. However, I decided to give this $250 option a try, and I'm pleasantly surprised by its performance.Firstly, the setup was straightforward, and the device is comfortable to wear throughout the day. The design is discreet, which is a plus for me as I prefer not to draw attention to my hearing aid.In terms of performance, I found that it significantly improved my ability to hear conversations, television, and other everyday sounds. While it may not have all the fancy features of higher-end models, it effectively amplifies sound without distortion, which is exactly what I needed.Battery life has been impressive as well. I can go a days without needing to recharge, which is convenient for my busy lifestyle.Overall, if you're on a budget and in need of a reliable hearing aid, I highly recommend giving this option a try. It may not have all the bells and whistles, but it gets the job done effectively."
165,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Value for the money - some small pieces for initial fit.,"I bought this for my dad. So far they are very good. He would have needed help putting these together as the pieces are very small and he doesn't have the dexterity to work on the very small pieces.The initial unboxing was a bit confusing as there were 3 smaller boxes in side of the larger box (normal), but each ear has 7 bags of their own (for different size parts for a better fit), plus the charging base mount kit bag, so 15 little bags total.I would like to have had the voice that says ""powered on"" and ""powered off"", like is standard for bluetooth earbuds. It also amplifies echoes - so if he walks into a smaller room, the sound bounces off the walls and is amplified more than once.Perhaps there could even be an app for the smart phone for volume or sound control and (or is that a different model?) or a ""find my..."" option. Otherwise, they seem a very good value for the money. I'm waiting on a full report from my dad, but if it all goes well with him, it looks like we'll get a set for my mom as well."
165,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good product so far,"I am new to the hearing aid world.  I was diagnosed at 33 in 2012 with tinnitus and hearing loss at higher frequencies.  Now, after 14 years of exposure to firearms, sirens, and repeated fire alarms pertaining to my career, I am having more trouble hearing.  It seems like everyone mumbles, and I can’t watch TV without the captions or I keep asking people in the room what is being said.In waiting to see my audiologist, I purchased these aids to see if they would help improve my hearing a little.They weren’t too hard to set up in my opinion, but I can see how someone might need help if they aren’t familiar with QR codes and such.I was alarmed at first use since it sounded like I was in a tube, and every sound was magnified completely.  I switched to the closed tipped ear pieces as I needed a bit more sound restriction than the device would allow which helped.I like how easy they are to put on, and use.  The volume and programs are easy to set, and I barely notice they are in my ears.  I also like that the lights on the device aren’t on while I am wearing them so they can’t be seen through my hair or when my hair is up.Today, I spoke to someone on the phone and felt like the aids helped.  I also haven’t said “What?” as much while speaking with friends in person.I will see how it goes as my brain gets used to hearing more.  Overall, they are a great price and seem to be working. I will do an update once I have more experience with the product.****Update- 1/25/24I got the hearing aids on Dec 14th, and have worn them every day since.  It has taken about that long for my brain to reprocess all sounds.  Everything was so loud to start, I was nauseous from normal sounds.  But now the sound quality has improved greatly, and everything I hear isn’t as magnified.  I am so glad I tried them.  They have truly been great, and allowed me to hear more which makes communication easier and more enjoyable.  Especially with my kiddo."
165,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love them, much better then others I have used","I have been hard of hearing most of my life, so I have been through my share of prescription hearing aids, OTC ones, and even amplifiers.  After going through a few different types and brands, and hating them, I bought these based on the reviews, and I am happy to say, the reviews weren't wrong.  These have been great so far.  I am very happy with my purchase.  For the price, can't go wrong with these.  Here's what I like:1.  Sound quality - these have been the best so far that I have had that allow me to hear speech as clearly as possible, my hearing is pretty bad and no hearing aid is going to allow you to hear 100% perfect but with my other aids I would say I could follow about 40-50% of a conversation, with these I would say I can hear 80-90% of what is said (without hearing aids I have to lip read, I can't hear what someone is saying even if I am right next to them and I have to use CC on tv).  I have also heard things for the first time with these that I have not heard with my other aids in the past.  Also some hearing aids I've had in the past have issues with cutting in and out, so far haven't had that problem with these.  Some OTC aids can have a pretty low volume making it hard to hear much, or they will have awful feedback if you turn them up any.  Earcentric has plenty of volume, and any feedback experience can be fixed by choosing correct type and size of domes.2.  Surround sound - now this one caught me off guard.  I have always hated the fact when wearing hearing aids its often difficult to tell where the sound is coming from.  Some brands I might be able to tell if it was left or right but that was about it.  With these I can naturally tell in any direction where the sound is coming from....I LOVE THAT lol.3.  Rocker switch volume - anyone who has worn hearing aids will tell you the little dials can be a pain.  If you accidentally scratch near your ear you may hit it, sometimes if you don't move them just right they crackle or cut the sound out completely, and if you wear glasses sometimes they will hit the dial.  I hate the dials lol.  These have rocker switches....SO much easier and no worries about accidentally bumping them and even if you somehow managed to do that they are easier to readjust than the dials are.4.  Comfort - they are very comfortable, and that is a big deal for hearing aids, if they hurt your not gonna want to wear them.Battery life - no complaints, they charge as they should and hold the charge as expected.TIPS:I found that my right ear accepts a small dome better, and my left took a med one.  When I tried to use a small dome in my left ear the hearing aid had alot of feedback (squealing).  Moving up one size fixed that.I pretty much scanned the manual as I know the drill, worn various kinds for years.  But I didn't notice them mentioning this in the manual so one thing to be mindful of is when you change out the dome either to clean them or change the size, make sure to push them on properly.  The way I know on any hearing aid the dome is on is by running my finger over the hole opening after I push it on, if its very smooth and I don't feel a slight ridge or lip, I know it didn't get on all the way.As with any hearing aid, you'll have to learn to get used to how they sound.  Aids are like new shoes, regardless of brand you have to give it time for things to start sounding more natural to you.  At first things may sound ""tinny"" or ""loud"".  I didn't have that issue much with these as I'm used to wearing hearing aids, but I did notice at first when I heard running water it sounded like crackling paper or crackling fire, but after wearing them for a bit that went away as I became more used to them.I am very happy with my purchase.  Even talked my sister into ordering these."
165,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Recommend to try these first,"these are great and i would buy them again. you have to work with these, they are not a magic fix, and if you can't use them, don't blame the product if you can't get used to them.  there are distinctive beeps that let you know what you are doing with the adjustments. i thought how could people act like these change your life. I actually had the same feeling the first day i had one in my left ear. I still have not figured out about wearing two of them. i only use one as of now. i will update when i work out the kinks.  i bulled right into wearing them all day, even in resteraunts where noise was a problem. i turned the only one i had in my ear all the way down, but still it was loud. i must say i was right next to the cooks station and even my wife said they were louder making conversation and cooking than usual. there are alot of supplies that come with it, i mean allot of different stuff.  And if the support is right, i get free supplies for a year.  We will see.  Support is very nice, and you can chat or email.  now i want you to remember that i only wear one in my worst ear, and it has made a huge difference in appreciating everything. the third day i wore them for praise band practice, that was great, there were two other guitar, three singers, and a flute.  it was to loud at the beginning, but they are easy to adjust.  a rocker switch for volume and a 2-program switch, the different programs are interesting, but i just use the one that works the best for me. that's what i am trying to say, if you work with learning how they work and how to adjust them, you will be amazed like i am.  And i don't wear them all the time in the house or certain activities i won't wear them for like target practice.  I was even told by support that i should wear two. i am getting very favorable results wearing only one, but eventually i will try and figure out wearing the both of them.  i had times when i got high pitched squeals when i had the adjusted two high, but quickly reduced the volume. instead of paying 500 to 1000 dollars for a pair, i got these with a amazon prime early deal with money of the original price.  if i can be of any help to answer any questions, feel free to write me. i still feel wonderful about the purchase and i am excited every time i put the hearing amplification device in my ear."
165,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Light weight and comfortable,I just got these hearing aids and they light and comfortable. I had hearing aids before and got fed up with them as the domes kept falling off in my canal with these I know I won’t have the problem. It will take awhile to get used to hearing things again and I know my family be happy I can understand them again! This purchase was a good choice and I can hardly tell that they are on my ears!
165,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Peace of sound,"At first I was skeptical, I had a hearing aid paid a couple thousand for them but they quit and now hearing aids are out my price range so I thought I would give these a try. Let me tell you the sound quality and the calming down of background noise is amazing and I recommend the portable charger, oh I almost forgot for those of you who are electrictronically challenged these are easy to set up, and they fit great, so get you a pair you won’t be disappointed."
165,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great purchase,This is my 3rd set of hearing aids in about 17 years the ear centric has worked well no app required plug them in set the volume and go.
165,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,good value for the cost,"the sound is decent. they're a little big, but fairly comfortable. i'd consider them to be a decent alternative to the high dollar options"
165,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,A steal at this price; very useful,"These hearing aids promise to be my salvation. I have been looking since my German ones that I paid $6K for went off warranty and the audiologist refused to maintain them even with my paying the insurance. I think I have now gone around the system and hopefully they will work well. The hot South Florida Sun and salt in the air might be challenges, but I also bought the remote charger and dryer so I hope to keep them in ship-shape so to speak... at nearly 70 I need dependability, both for my regular job and for my adjunct professorship."
165,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,First set of hearing aids,So far I have been happy with them. It’s my first set of hearing aids so I’m surprised at what I’ve been missing. I’m so far happy that I didn’t spend $4000 on a set.
165,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,great product & value,"occasional mild feedback when answering phone, otherwise great product & value"
165,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Amazing quality, amazing value","I got these for my 91 yr old grandmother as her hearing has recently gotten terrible. They were easy to set up, we are SHOCKED at how well she can hear with these hearing aids because we were basically yelling at her before just to have normal conversations…and watching the tv- forget it! We used to have to go outside while she was watching anything. These are seriously amazing for the price! We were quoted $3,000 being a “deal” WITH insurance for aids from her local hearing center. Well I definitely recommend trying these before ordering overly priced!! Thanks a million earcentric and amazon for having these available."
165,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent clarity and easy to clean and to adjust volume at home,"These hearing aids have much better clarity than my previous $5,000 pair of hearing aids from a professional audiologist. My previous hearing aids required a trip to the audiologist for servicing every 3 months.  With a 20-minute wait in the lobby and then another 15 minutes with the technician. These hearing aids are easy to clean, every two days, taking about 6 minutes for each cleaning (both hearing aids).  They have buttons on them to adjust the sound amplification, a simple process of pressing a button to increase amplification or pressing a different button to decrease amplification. With my previous hearing aids, I had an app on my phone to use Bluetooth for adjusting the volume, but it was much harder to use."
165,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing Hearing Aids‼️,"I have known for a very long time that the hearing in my right ear is not good. Chronic problems from childhood and on. I have wanted to purchase hearing aids, but the cost held me back.Amazon has always been my favorite place to shop, so thought that I would give these a try. The price was great, and if they worked, I’d be so happy!Well, they did work, and I am extremely happy! For basically $200, I can hear, they are easy to use and operate, no “whistling” interference, and I love the behind the ear style!A very satisfied customer, thank you!!"
165,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Hearing Aids,"First time a hearing aids user, these improved my hearing 100%, do not be fooled by the price, pros or cons they do not connect to your phone, for me that was a plus since I do not carry my phone all the time."
165,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Price and sound quality,"Very pleased with the sound so far but i'm still doing a little adjusting with them ( ear domes and volume), very comfortable to wear."
165,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great buy for the money,"I have been wearing these hearing aids for a month and have had no problems with their performance at all.  My only issue is the aid is larger than what I had in the past and sticks out in the back of my ear.  I have small ears; but I am getting use to it.  Thank you, good purchase (so far)"
165,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Ear Centric hearing aids,"Received aids very fast shipping. So far I am very pleased, I have used several brands of amplifiers and these are the best. Charging is fast and simple and I like the fact that I can call a real person should there be any problems. Good sound and clear"
165,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Product as Advertized,MY wife has not been able to hear for 3 months due to medical problem.  With these she was able to hear immediately.
165,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,They work well,I got thes for my 80 year old dad and he seems to like them. I think my mother needs some stronger one's not sure if this manufacturer makes stronger one's
165,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great for the price.,"These hearing aids are a good buy for the price. If you give them a day or two for adjusting to your needs, they work well. Easy to use. sound quality is fair."
165,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,I can hear,"The minute I completed charging them and put them in I was like a child realizing his first Christmas. My hearing, hasn't been this great in over twenty years. My heart almost broke when I could actually hear my 5 month old grandson giggling at me!!! When I saw this and read the reviews I decided if they don't work it's not the only $150 I spent on THINGS..BUT TRUST ME, THEY WORK!!! Other devices, even with my insurance,  was over $1500!!!"
165,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good value,Good value. Easy to insert and use
165,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Works well!,Works well for lost replacement.
165,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Very easy to setup and use.  Good value,"This was purchased because a family member recommended it and said it was a good value and worked just as well if not better than the hearing aids that they used that cost much much more.  I was skeptical at first, but it really did perform better than expected."
165,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,A winner on a hard to convince patient,"My father had tried several hearing devices before, never satisfied with none: too noisy, feedback prone, not clear enough, uncomfortable...Seeing an opportunity I asked him if he'd try another set that I knew were of recent market introduction.He agreed and I ordered a set. Once delivered we went through the included documentation and guide, while the devices recharged. Once ready he tried them on - we had set the volume to the lowest and while he wore them my sister adjusted the volume up until he was good with it.Three weeks after initial use he still wears them, they have been a boon. We highly recommend them."
165,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Last minute replacement,I was getting ready to leave for a cruise in 3 days and my expensive hearing aid charger quit working. I bought these as a last minute temporary replacement to use while on my cruise. They were delivered overnight so I had them in time for my trip. The sound quality is not quite as good as my regular ones but adequate.
165,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,The ease at which your hearing aid fits into you ear in seconds,"Upon using the hearing aid for the first time, I was taken aback at how problematic my hearing loss had become  My son complained every time I visited my grandchildren saying how I could not hear anything he was saying to me. I blamed him for speaking low and fast. Using the product for the first time, my son and myself were shocked at how immediately my hearing was restored"
165,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,There is a lot of background noise,"There is a lot of background noise, but they are well worth the money. I could not believe what I paid for them and how well they worked bought other brands that are about the same price but not near the quality or sound performance. They are definitely worth a try I love mine."
165,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,A nice low cost alternative,"I got these after using an amplifier in one ear for a year. I have obviously lost a good bit of my high frequency range in my hearing. These work. I can definitely hear better with them. They are reasonably comfortable, and the charging base is nice and works. I did notice that the air conditioner noise, and the sprinkler system noise (water pipe high under our couch) is kind of prominent. But for the price, these are a good buy."
165,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,easy to wear,like the it is helpful to me to help me around people and crowds
165,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fantastic hearing Aid,"I have been wearing hearing aids since I was 12 years old, my first one was a Zenith bte and all hearing aids have changed a lot since then. I have bought about 3 Beltone hearing ais over the years that were also digital. But usually, it only works good for 2 years. Then going back for service about every 90 days to get a new receiver. My last one quit in January 2024. It was also my last Beltone!!! so I started shopping for hearing aids. I tried to get one from Ebay. Little did I know it was from China. I could never use it because all the instructions were written in Chinese. So, I returned it. I never got my money back from Ebay from Homecare-sensen. So much for guarantees or money back. Then I ordered this one Amazon. it has got good volume and clear voice sounds. If could have found this several I would have saved enough money. to go to Hawaii. Most of the time I have to check to see if they are still in my ear. No more overpriced hearing aids for me, thanks to EarCentric and Amazon."
165,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great for the money,"I've had a couple of over-the-counter behind-the-ear hearing aids before I got these.  The others were much more expensive and did not really have better sound than the earcentrics.  I had the Bose and the Tweak Enhance aids.  The Bose required replacing the batteries every three days and the Enhance only held a charge for 12-13 hours.  The Earcentric holds a charge for at least 17 hours (they advertise 20 hrs. or more).The Earcentric aids are very basic - no phone app and no frequency adjustments.  They do have two modes: normal conversation and noisy environment, but I can't detect any difference between them.  So basically all you can do is adjust the volume.  But if your hearing loss is the typical one where there's more loss at higher frequencies, then these aids will work pretty well.The amazing thing is that these amplify just as well as the more expensive ones I've tried.  Plus, the ear dome adapters have both open and closed versions.  I've found the closed version works better for me.  My other aids had different dome sizes, but only one style - the open one.  That lets in outside sounds and makes them more susceptible to feedback that causes whistling if you put your hand near the aids.  The earcentric has different size of both types of ear domes.  it comes with plenty of accessories and even some spare parts.So the earcentric aids, even though very basic, do just as well and even better than the more complex types I've tried.  That makes this aid very good for anyone who might get confused with extra adjustments and features.The lowest amplification level is a bit higher than other aids, so if your hearing loss is very mild these might be a bit loud at the lowest setting.  The good news is that you can amplify sounds more than some other aids.In summary, these are incredible aids for the price.  They're simple to use, have more options with the ear domes that fit in the ear (I didn't try the  high gain tubing option that came with it).  The sound fidelity is as good as more expensive aids, although the very expensive types (>$1000) probably are even better. I haven't tried their customer support, but they do seem to have good support, based on the literature.I still have a little trouble with the intelligibility of speech, even though it's louder with the aids,  but the more expensive aids gave me the same problem.  I highly recommend the earcentric as being the most cost effective hearing aids that meet the minimum requirements for better hearing."
165,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Device at an Attractive Price,"I was fitted with a pair of Widex hearing aids about 6 years ago. Price back then was about $5000. They finally quit working and weren’t worth repairing. They had Bluetooth, multiple programs, and a tinnitus feature. But after wearing them for several years I found I wasn’t using most of these features.. I was also having trouble using Google Maps in the car. Turn instructions were routed to the hearing aids instead of the car speakers- regardless of how I set the app’s Navigation settings. My Earcentric devices came yesterday. I’ve charged them up and found them to be very comfortable. Looking forward to better hearing."
165,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love these!,"So happy with these hearing aids. I don't have a problem with them whistling, which I really appreciate. I will definitely be purchasing these again when I need replacements."
165,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Worthwhile hearing improvement.,This product actually improves my hearing.  I have purchased other relatively low cost hearing aids and they did not help significantly.  These are different and worth the money.  They do not have gain adjustable for different frequencies (frequency dependent gain).  Such would help with high frequencies where my hearing is worst.  But for the price such a feature is a bit much to ask.
165,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Hearing Aids Work,Purchased for my 89 yr old Mother. It’s a challenge for her but once she gets them placed in her ears they do definitely improve her hearing. Hoping that in time she’ll get used to them.
165,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Improves my ability to hear,"I've only had these on for about two hours, so it is hard to give a decent review. They were easy to set up. The ability to hear better is definite. I haven't tried the noise cancellation part yet, so don't know how that will be. If one's hearing isn't too far gone, this definitely helps. I can now hear my wife calling me from the other end of the house, which was difficult before. And I don't have the sound turned up all that far, yet."
165,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great product,Sound is excellent. It's so nice to hear when people talk to me.
165,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,It’s a great product for someone who needs larger volume control buttons to maneuver,Got this product for my 88 yr old father with significant hearing loss. So far (day 3) it’s working great
165,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"EarCentric EasyCharge Rechargeable Hearing Aids (Pair) for Seniors, Behind-The-Ear BTE Ear Aid","I finally found hearing aids that work for me! No more buzzing or wind sound in my hears, just ore volume so I can hear people taking. I highly recommend these, you will not be sorry. One note, the battery life for me is 12-13hrs, no problem, I bought a extra charging base for my car."
165,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good but not noise cancellating,"Tried 3 different kinds, this was the most user friendly as far as charging.  I only have one problem.  I thought these had noise canceling however I have a slight prob making out what someone is saying to me that is sitting right across from me in a crowded restaurant.  Excellent for watching TV bud difficult to hear if someone is standing behind me."
165,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Start with a low volume setting.,I am very happy with these hearing aides. I had prescription hearing aides for about 12 years but they finally died. I actually hear better with this product than I ever hear with the old prescription aids.
165,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed,Left.one has now refused to take a full charge. Will charge partially and die in middle m of the day.
165,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Just received them! So far, very easy to use!",Purchased these for my mom. She found them easy to use and liked the size!
165,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Not specular but about as good as the name brand I spent thousands for 6 years ago.,Volume not great for my hearing defect but ok. Looked for something I could afford that would somewhat help. These do it. My brother borrowed them while visiting me. He has profound hearing loss and had forgot his charger. He could hear enough to understand me if he was close and looking at me.
165,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,earcentic hearing aids,1) comments 2) tips of uses  1) these hearing aids work awesome comfortable to wear and you can pick up conversations and TV shows very easily you do get some background noise but nowhere near as much as I did with the other pair I had and great sound quality  definitely recommend!!!  2) You get a bunch of plastic bags when you open the box look for booster kit install the booster kit which is easy and explained in the instructions if you don’t install the booster kit they don’t work that good
165,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome hearing aids,Bought these for my 85 year old husband. He denied having hearing issues. I was so tired of repeating everything and yelling so he could understand me.  The moment I put them in he had to turn the tv down and he told me to lower my voice.I am in love and told my friends about them.
165,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Incredible quality for a great price!,"I didn't expect very good results upon buying these - but I'd lost one of my (yet again) hearing aids - the ones you get fitted for at an audiologist, and cost ~$3000 EACH. I also was pessimistic, because I'd never had over-the-ear hearing aids; my concern was that they would shift and be unusable, given how many times I swap my glasses (computer, distance, sunglasses).Turns out that I was a moron. None of that happened, these managed switches from loud settings to quiet conversations REALLY well! Sound quality is really high-end; just be careful when you're changing silicone earpieces, otherwise, these almost fit themselves! I'm seriously happy with this purchase, two thumbs up for anyone interested :-)"
165,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,The quality and price,"I bought these hearing aides for my dad as he had purchased a pair from Sanford and paid $5,000 for them and they lasted five years. He didn’t want to pay another $5,000 for another pair so we some researching and found this pair to have the best reviews.  We haven’t had them that long but the quality of them seem to be really great for the price. We’re very pleased with them!"
165,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,I can hear!,"My hearing in one ear has been going downhill in the last few years. I’m a teacher of English language learners. Many are self conscious about their English speaking skills, so talk quietly most of the time. Now I can hear our conversations and help so much easier.These are great and easy to use and charge for a fraction of the cost of other hearing aids. Thank you!"
165,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent Product!!!,These work great for me! Resolved my hearing problem completely! An audiologist was going to charge me $2000 over and above the $2000 my health plan would pay. I decided to try these first and they work great! No more hearing problems!
165,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,good plus hearing aids,hearing aids perform as described. they are as good as or better then my expensive hearing aids.
165,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,great hearing aids.,worked perfect right out of the box. simple to learn how to use them.
165,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Pretty good for the price,"I tried these out with my mother with dementia. She could definitely hear better, but because they were different from her Miracle Ear hearing Aids, she couldn't manage the controls. She couldn't remember to turn them on, how to adjust the volume, or that they needed to go in the charger at night. No reflection on the hearing aids. However, the tone was a bit bassy. They would be better if they had bluetooth/phone adjustments. Would be better if you could lock the controls once set as well.I would have kept them if they had battery compartments for the on switch like the ones she has now."
165,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Works great,"Product appears to work real well. This is my second amazon hearing aid I tried so I might not be a great source for comparisson, but works good for me for most situation. Only negative is it cant handle loud sound real well."
165,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good buy for the price,"Purchased because my actual hearing aids broke and needed some until insurance would cover another pair. These are definitely better quality than the amplifiers you will find. These are NOT amplifiers and are actual HEARING AIDS. My only issue is if I’m listening to music in the car, it sounds distorted and I usually have to take them out."
165,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Takes time,"I’m am new to hearing aids and have a lot of sounds to get used too, but so far they are working well."
165,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,I can hear again yeah,These hearing aid are great...I can hear better then most of my friends that went to a dr. And got expensive hearing aids. Easy to use charge quickly and best of all no batteries needed.
165,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,BTE keeps me in tune,I ordered the Easy Charge BTE for Seniors. This is my 2nd week for using and getting accustomed with them. I use the small dome for a comfortable fit. must say I can now hear and watch a movie well instead of just watching. I like the sleek BTE with the unnoticeable clear tubes. The battery holds charge well. And the carrying case makes it easy for me to slip into my purse for when they are not needed. And I have to say that the customer service is awesome!!!  Answering my questions quickly and thoroughly. Nice choice of product for mild hearing loss.
165,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Can't hear?,"I have had Phonak aids for years, lost one and didn't want to spend another $3,000. After reading the instructions several times on your product I  was able to adjust them to where they work quite nicely. Your staff was most helpful as well."
165,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love my EarCentric Hearing Aids!,I recently received my EarCentric hearing aids and after charging them I found them very easy to operate.  I have mild to moderate hearling loss and now I no longer need to crank up the volume on the TV.  I love that I hardly even notice they are in my ears!  I also wear glasses and I'm able to wear the hearing aids with no problem at all!  I am extremely pleased with my decision to purchase of these hearing aids!!
165,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Impressed by these hearing aids,"I bought these for my 99 year old mother in a nursing home. We could not get parts for her old ones that cost $2-3,000. She can hear better than she did before!!! And we didn't have to use the large tubes that are included for hard of hearing."
165,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Easy to adjust,"These are very easy to adjust the program and the volume even if I am wearing them. Pleased with the sound quality for OTC hearing aids. No they work don't like $5,000 aids through a hearing center but they work just fine for me. I would buy theses again."
165,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Quality Product - and they work !!,"I have always had excellent hearing and this has been my first experience with hearing aids.  However, I'm 74 now and went to an indoor firing range almost 4 months ago.  They gave me ear plugs to wear, but, I am losing  the dexterity in my finger tips and didn't do a very good job of inserting them.  I fired off about 90 rounds from my new 9 mm Glock.  It seemed very loud at the time, but, I didn't think that much of it.  However, immediately afterwards, it was apparent that my hearing was impaired. I tried a couple different types of hearing aids (to include the the type advertised by Joe Namoth on TV)  also a couple different brands of amplifiers.  None really worked that well for me.  Not to say they didn't work, they just didn't work for me.I'm, pleased with the EarCentric ones.  The price, the fit, the convenience are all good.  As a newcomer to hearing aids, I also found their written instructions on how to get used to them and what to expect and/or not expect to be very useful.The longer I have them and use them the more I like them."
165,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Easy to wear; easy to use,"Bought these for my mother, but tried them myself for a day. They are comfortable to wear. Not too many controls or options, so they are easy to use. One button to turn on / turn off/ change mode. One rocker switch to adjust volume up / down. They do a nice job of making other people's voices clear, and loud enough to hear easily. Be careful with the volume control, as there is no feedback limiter and these hearing aids do get loud enough to feed back while semi-open domes are in use.These hearing aids come with an assortment of domes and tubes, so it should be possible to find a comfortable combination for most needs. The frequency range seems quite wide, with compensation starting at about 1kHz and going above 20kHz. My mom  can hear an ultrasonic pest repellent with these hearing aids.The charging base is also convenient and super easy to use."
165,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"No doctor visits, affordable","1st time using hearing aids, and was pleasantly surprised.  Simple to use, and even my wife is impressed that I can hear things that I hadn't been able to hear before.  The price was right, I didn't have to fool with doctors appointments.  Why pay thousands of dollars for a set when you can get these babies for a couple of hundred.  The last part  of the equation is how long are they going to last. Only time will tell, but so far so good, and I would definitely purchase these again."
165,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works great!,"I ordered these for my step father who was in a bind.  He needed tongo to the VA and get his hearing aids...I think they are the normal $5000 ones that he gets for free at the VA.He didn't have time to get them before having to go into the hospital.  So, in a pince, we ordered theses.  He said they were the best he had ever bought ""over the counter"".  I asked him if he wanted to go back to the VA for the others and he said he may just continue in with these even if he had to order another pair due to a loss of one or some other unforeseen event.Buy these.  You won't regret it."
165,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Hearing Again!,Setup was very quick and easy. My ears had to get used to the feeling of wearing the hearing aide and the everyday noises that I hadn’t really heard before. Everything seemed so loud at first. It took a couple of days of wearing them all day and then it was so nice to be able to hear all the things that I was missing. No more loud TV or asking someone to repeat what they said. I would recommend charging them every night.  Tried at first not to charge for a couple of days and by the early evening of the second day needed to be charged again. The clear tubing and behind the ear makes the aides hidden.I don’t know why I waited so long to get them but you definitely won’t regret being able to hear again!
165,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome OTC rechargeable hearing aids for the price!,"My husband and I are both moderately to profoundly deaf with bi-lateral hearing loss.  I am also going totally blind, and so it's imperative that I can depend on my other senses, such as my hearing.  I just recently bought two pairs of Ear Centric Easy Charge rechargeable hearing aids for me and my husband, and we cannot tell you enough how delighted we are with this purchase!The volume output and voice quality and clarity is astronomical!  I personally have used medically-grade ITE hearings aids for decades, but never have gotten the clarity and volume output like I can with these OTC BTE Ear Centric's Easy Charge rechargeable hearing aids.  We both love the ease of charging and the amount of time they stay charged up to 20 hours.  No more fumbling or losing disposable batteries.  Another feature we love is once you set your desired volume and program...it stays on those settings by default until you make further changes if you so desire.  The power/program button and volume rocker switch is easy to use.  The all day comfort is wonderful too.  You hardly can notice you're wearing them.  Furthermore, Ear Centric's Customer Service is one of a kind!  Anna was so polite, kind, patient and professional in resolving our questions or concerns.  We want to be honest with our review, so here it goes:  We would both give these a 5 star rating, but we're  only giving (4 - 1/2) stars rating.  The reason why, is the microphone on these hearing aids don't handle music real well.  Depending on the song or loudness of our stereo we both have experienced frequent distortion/static, otherwise, there is no comparison, for the price , to the (voice) quality, clarity and volume output, which is more important to us, as seniors, to function better in our everyday lives.  If you have any issues don't hesitate to call Ear Centric.  I had an issue with itchy ears, Anna from Ear Centric immediately sent me some different domes for sensitive ears -  problem solved!  I cannot thank my sister enough for introducing us to these hearing aids, as she is also moderately to profoundly deaf.  She and I have tried a few other OTC brands.  Don't waste your money!  Give these a try FIRST.Corinne & Navaras ChavezUSA"
165,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Quality aides that won't break your budget,"I came across the EarCentric EasyCharge Rechargeable Hearing Aids while doing a search on Amazon. I researched them both on Amazon's site and on EarCentric's own website. I read everything I could and studied the reviews and decided to give them a shot. I bought them from Amazon because I could have them by the next day. I worried whether they would be loud enough for my moderate severe losses. They're plenty loud and the volume control allows me to change programs depending on the situation. My hearing losses are bad enough that I'm never going to find a magic answer. Volume is one thing and comprehension is another. I understand about as well as I did with the ReSound I've been using, but they do sound different. That's not unexpected because I noticed the same thing when I switched off from ReSound and bought Siemens instead. It takes a little time for the ear to get used to the new sound it's picking up. I've been tested and found quite proficient in lip reading and along with the EarCentric aides I should be good to go in most environments. At $199 for a pair, the price was a no-brainer. I certainly would recommend them to those trying to avoid the high cost of conventional hearing aids, particularly people with little or no insurance to help. Count this as a favorable review."
165,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Fingers crossed,"It just arrived on time. One day shipping. Happy about that. My loved one is in their mid 90s. Significant issues now with hearing and is very worried about losing a different device we tried. This one seems like it is durable and will tuck behind the ear well and give a sense of security. As much as it cost, I hope it’s an upgrade from our previous device. It came with a lot of accessories and helpful tips but I doubt a 90+ year old is going to practice so that may not apply to us. We’ll update after it’s charged. Happy hearing!"
165,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Worked till it didn’t!,"I bought for my husband who has almost no hearing in one ear and very poor hearing in the other.  I get tired of yelling to be heard.  He already had professional hearing aid for many years and beside the arm breaking cost, they worked less time and were always having to be sent off for repair.  He tried an in the ear amplifier that after not hearing at all with them they were returned to Amazon.  I was looking online and just happened to be on a deal.  It had over 5,000 buyers with a 4 1/2 stars.  Ordered them and got them the next day.  He charged them and guess what, they worked.  He fiddled with the settings with two programs.  He immediately said he heard me.  I have to learn to talk in normal tones now.  When the dog started barking he jumped.  The hearing aids have a three week learning curve of getting used to the sounds.  He told me now when he sat out with all the birds he feeds he said he can differentiate the different birds by their sound.  I am so happy I could cry.  Today he went to work with them in I imagine the other workers were happy too.  These work!  You have nothing to lose and everything to gain.  I did buy a two year protection plan!  Plan was well worth taking out!"
165,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,SOOOO HAPPY WITH THESE!!!,"I've been trying to find affordable, quality hearing aids for my mother who doesn't have a lot of money to spend and these are it!  I had tried another inexpensive brand and the feedback and whistling was constant and unbearable.  I was nervous to try another inexpensive pair but decided to try these as there were so many good reviews.  She's not tech-savvy so these are perfect.  On/Off & Volume control...that's basically it. And they are rechargeable.  She has it on the lowest volume setting as her hearing is not severe.  This works perfectly for her.  She's extremely happy!  I would definitely recommend trying these before spending $2000 on a more upscale set of hearing aids...especially if this fits your budget better.  You can't beat them for the price.  Oh, and they supply you with great instructions as well as video tutorials.  The customer service is apparently American based and other reviewers have stated it's great.  We haven't needed to use them yet."
165,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,I've been diagnosed with significant hearing loss and am very happy with the EarCentric hearing aid.,"I've been diagnosed with severe hearing loss and am currently using prescription Phonak Audeo hearing aids ($4000). I purchased the EarCentric EasyCharge hearing aids to wear while kayaking, on the beach or in situations where I'm concerned about losing or damaging my prescription hearing aids. I'm extremely pleased with the EarCentric hearing aids. In more than a few situations, they are as good as the Phonak aids. The only significant benefit from my prescription hearing aids is the blue tooth feature."
165,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great value,"I have used the expensive Phonak aids that cost me thousands. The had Bluetooth comm between the ears and were water resistant, but used batteries.I consider these superior because they are rechargeable. Even if the batteries degrade over time, this will save me a bundle.Do they work? Just as well as the phonak. They make things louder, which is what I want.They do squeal, but only when my hand or something large gets close to the microphone, which is at the top. So sometimes when I am adjusting volume, that will cause it to squeal on one side. I just need to develop technique to prevent that, but it isn't horrible.These are just as comfortable as the Phonak and its convenient to grab them from the charger each morning and return them at night, so I have never experienced a lack of charge situation.I am very happy that they work as well as they do. Others may be better in some ways, but I'm keeping these."
165,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Hearing Aids,I didn’t expect to like these so much and that they would work so well for me! I can hear so much better now and understand what is being said. They are comfortable and discreet. Easy to use and well worth the money to me! I’ve only had them for a short time though so can’t say how well they will hold up. I will update at a later date.
165,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Can hear voices clearer with them.,"I bought a cheaper pair of hearing aids/amplifiers initially, but got lots of screaming and loud individual noises here and there. Returned them right away (thanks to Amazon's good return policy).These EarCentric aids only cost about $100 more but I can certainly tell the difference.I only have a fairly minor hearing problem as can't hear conversations well in a noisy environment, like a busy cafe, etc. (well it is not such a minor problem at the time though!). Anyway wearing these aids make the speech clearer. The aids/amplifiers have 2 sound settings. One for general use and one more for speech amplification (plus have volume controls too).I can't really say much for people with a serious hearing problem, but they will be useful for me. I don't plan to wear them all the time, but will help when I do.They aren't so obvious wearing them (I bought the silver ones), and fairly easy to put on and adjust the settings while on.Nice little carry pack and lots of different sized ear pieces, and the aids look well made.The company also have short videos available to show you how to use them, etc., so you don't feel like you are on your own."
165,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Appreciating The Opportunity!,"Thank you for an affordable option to allow me to hear so much better! My hearing aides came quickly,  well packaged and quite easy to get up and running. I would have liked to have had a booklet with directons, but on-line videos were helpful."
165,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Took some fiddling, but satisfied","My hearing is quite different between ears. Took me a couple of weeks to figure out the right doams to use and volume to get ears balanced, but in the end they are working well for me. This is my second hearing device in the last 15 years and is an improvement over my first aids."
165,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Can hear much better.,"I purchased these hearing aids for my 97 year old Mother. She is happy with them. I have to put them in for her, so I am not always sure about them being on or about the volume.  It would probably be better for someone that can put them in for themself. She can definitely hear better. She told me that I didn't have to yell at her!"
165,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good service review on behalf of my father,I ordered Ear centric hearing Aid from Amazon.It stopped charging and did not function. I called the company and spoke to Mary at Customer service. Amazon was not contacted as 30 days had passed.Ear Centric Company stands behind its warranty and product service. The customer service personnel are most efficient and helpful. They even sent me emails to watch the videos for using the hearing aid.  I am very much impressed byEar Centric company .  Its service cannot be matched by any other company.  Its product is sold at the most reasonable and affordable price. I highly recommend Ear Centric company for buying its hearing aids.Kal A.
165,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great idea,"So far so good, my grandmother is really enjoying them. She forgot they were in her ears. The only challenge she has is trying to put them in."
165,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,First hearing aid ever. Couldn't be happier.,"I have been losing my hearing gradually for many years and have gotten to the point where it's hard to keep up conversations If there is any background noise at all. I went to Costco and got fitted for a $4000 top of the line hearing aidAnd try it in Store for 1 hour. I Am so happy I didn't buy It and read all the reviews here on Amazon about this hearing aid. I'm an American living in Costa Rica and I ordered it on a Sunday evening and had it in my hands by Wednesday morning. I read the quick little book, charged hearing aids then put them in my ears and couldn't be more happy. I immediately heard sounds I have not heard in years like rain, wind blowing through the trees and now my wife can stop shouting at me as well as I lowered the TV from a 65 to a 13 on the volume. Today we went to the local Hooligans for lunch to try them out and how it would be in a very noisy environment and they are working perfectly. I can finally have a conversation with people with very loud background music and hear them clearly. I am thrilled I chose Ear Centric and couldn't be happier with the clarity and the quality of the sound I'm getting for a pair of hearing AIDS that were a little bit over $200.For me this is a huge quality of life increase, a true game changer. Give them a try and I hope you see the same results I have."

91,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very pleased with my Sontro hearing aids,"I am very pleased with my Sontro hearing aids.  The hearing aids are lightweight, comfortable, nearly invisible, and let me hear things that I miss when I am not wearing them.  The sound quality is excellent! I love that I can take a hearing test at any time in the privacy of my own home and easily recalibrate the hearing aids to my current hearing. The otoTune app that I downloaded to my iPhone is easy to use, and I can discreetly adjust the volume and settings of my hearing aids by using the app.I feel that I made the right call buying these Sontro over-the-counter hearing aids. There was no pushy salesperson like I have had in an audiologist office, who wanted to upsell me things I didn’t need. The price is way better than what I would have paid had I bought from an audiologist.  And no more trips to the audiologist office to get my hearing aids adjusted!"
91,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Fitting on the ear not secure,"I tried the aids. While the quality of sound was ok, there were following problems:- The carrying case was just a box. No place to securely place the aids- In order to disconnect, battery case needed to be opened. Besides being a pain in the neck, there was fear of the harness breaking off over time- Worst, the fitting over the ear was loose. I lost one piece (second time I wore it outside home). I was not wearing a cap or running or jumping. Just chilling out at friend's place. When I came home, right ear piece was missing. Still looking for it.Had to return it.Now I have a Costco device and can feel the extra security of placement of the device."
91,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Soundwave gave me my hearing back!,"After realizing that my hearing loss was severe and that I had waited too long to address, I was compelled to search for a cost-effective solution which is one of the reasons I selected Soundwave Hearing.  Compared to the others, Soundwave’s product was just what I was looking for.  I was able to set up my hearing aids to match my hearing loss very easily.  The application used to do this is quick and intuitive making it simple for me to get started.  I did have reason to contact Soundwave “Customer Service” and I’m delighted to report that my questions were answered promptly and most importantly in a way that was easy to understand.  If you have a hearing loss Soundwave is the way to go."
91,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Complete Game Changer!,"I love these hearing aids!  I am maybe a little vain, and even though I have known for a  while I probably needed to take the plunge, all  of the hearing aids I tried were so obvious!!!  I  tend to wear my hair back and I don't want a billboard behind my ear telling everyone I can't hear well!But these are very subtle. Nobody even knows I have them on.  And I can actually hear conversations at my  favorite restaurant- a  little Italian  place that has lots of tables, lots  of people, and lots of noise!  I love to  go there and  to  other restaurants, but it used to  be very frustrating.  I  really hated missing parts of conversations.  Now I can hear everyone at my table without the background noise drowning them  out. I also  love the phone app.  I  feel like it makes the  hearing aid work  exactly the right way for me!  I  wish  I'd found this one sooner, because I wasted a lot of  time.  But now I  couldn't be happier."
91,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,I returned this product and they said I didn’t.,It wast a good product and they say I didn’t return it but I did
91,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product!,"I have been wearing these for a few weeks - what a great product! I have had difficulty hearing the nuances of conversations at work and at home. These hearing aids are a great help. I am able to hear folks at work much better and thus my performance in meetings has greatly improved. I wear glasses and I have found these to be very comfortable - no interference with glasses. The app is great, its intuitive and lets me control my hearing in different noise situations. My family is happy that I can hear them better - even when at a restaurant, concert or a one of my kids sporting events.Great product! I recommend it."
91,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Changed My Life!,"I have to admit that I was skeptical, but I am a recent convert. I ordered my Sontro hearing aids a while ago and wasn’t using them consistently. I chose to bring them along for parents weekend at my daughters college and it was amazing. I heard every word of every story even with the loud music. They have always been so easy to set up. The online tutorial was a breeze to use. Thank you Sontro. I now can actually hear my daughter’s collegiate friends."

96,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great BT Hearing Aid,"I bought LInner Nova a couple of weeks ago hoping it would be better than other BT hearing aids I had tried. Right from the start I could tell the difference I had hoped for. The set up is very easy and the BT connection is immediate. The app is well designed and offers good information and control. The sound is good with high available volume. Only negative was that the built in announcements like ""connected"" ""power off"" etc. are in very low volume and I could not hear them except in a very quite location. I hope they can fix it."
96,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,First look at new ones,The noise cancelation doesn't work real well  but the other functions se to work perfectly and are real pleased with them
96,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Didn't work well for me,"I've been wearing hearing amplifiers for several years, and currently have been looking for an upgrade for my current pair. I have pretty severe hearing loss, especially in my left ear.The good: The app was easy to navigate, and the self-hearing test was ok too. They connected to my phone quickly and I was able to adjust the volume and tone. They offer 4 different sound scenarios to choose from to help dial in the devices for background noise. and those seemed to work ok.The not so good: For me these seemed large and ill fitting, I tried changing the domes to different sizes and didn't have much luck finding a decent comfortable fit. Secondly, I didn't have much luck getting much sound to my left ear. either the device was defective, or poor fit wasn't allowing them to amplify the sound on that side. Thirdly, for me anyhow there was that issue of hearing myself inside of my own head when speaking. Like talking while plugging your ears. That alone made me decide that these weren't for me. I returned them for a refund and will continue to search for a brand that works for me."
96,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Can hear now,"We've tried other hearing aids, not good results.  This fit well and hearing is much improved.  They are very easy to adjust with your bluetooth phone. Really worth the money. Great investment."
96,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good product,"I tried a couple of other aids. I'm new to this. I really like these. They work well, are stylish and have a lot of control. Latest technology. Give them a try."
96,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Ok, not great.","These are more of an amplifier, not true hearing aids."
96,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Awful sent back!,"I was very excited to get these, but once in hand was very disappointed. They had no volume control. The left one was too loud and the right didn’t work at all. It’s like the right didn’t have a battery. I charged it many times without success. They were returned. I am waiting on money. Ugh!"
96,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works really well,These fit very well and the sound is excellent. They recharge quickly but I wish they'd last longer than 8 hours at a time. I like that the case has a built in sanitizing light as well.
96,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,I liked the size,These devices would just stop amplifing for a few minutes then come back on???
96,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Sounds ok,Battery doesn’t last more than half a day. It sometimes screeches in one ear. I can hear better though

96,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Another outstanding headphones, hearing help!","The manual was easy to understand, and setting it up was effortless. I appreciate how well they fit in my ears, especially since I have small ear canals. The noise-canceling feature is impressive, and the sound quality is excellent. However, one aspect to be cautious about is adjusting the volume. Personally, I have some hearing issues in my left ear, and when the volume is too loud, it can be uncomfortable and even painful. Therefore, I highly recommend reading the manual thoroughly to avoid any unpleasant experiences. On the bright side, the battery life is dependable. With intermittent use and proper storage in the case, it typically lasts around two weeks (approximately 10 hours per week)."
96,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Hi-Fi Sound Quality,This set of hearing aids is great!  It sounds like Hi Fi earbuds.  It is quiet which means the noise cancelling is functioning well.  It is comfortable to keep on my ears for a long period time.  It is very sensitive to any sound around including my own breathing which is a little strange to hear.  I wish my own breathing and coughing sound wouldn't be amplified so much.  I'm not sure it is doable because sound is sound.
96,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,A great deal,"This advanced hearing aid is crafted to deliver clear and crisp sound during everyday conversations while also providing the convenience of connecting to the TV hub. The hardware hub, equipped with an aux cable for seamless TV connectivity, is included. The red and blue colors on the earpieces serve as indicators for the right and left sides of the hearing aids. Users can effortlessly adjust noise cancellation and volume directly on the unit or through the user-friendly mobile app. The device offers numerous preset scene modes and customizable tone adjustments tailored to individual ears. Despite its competitive pricing, this hearing aid boasts an impressive array of customization options and high-quality performance."

96,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Wow! 144h runtime, UV sanitizer, Bluetooth and app, can take calls and listen to music, fantastic!!!","These are very well-made hearing amplifiers. They are very small and look similar to Apple AirPods, which is the main selling point for me. They are really indistinguishable from regular earbuds and even the charging case looks almost the same as Apple's one. This is excellent as no one would ever know if you are listening to music or using hearing aids. Hearing aid pieces and the charging case both have magnets and when you place the hearing aids in the charger they pop into their place. It takes a couple of hours until the green charging LED turns on. After charging, the hearing aids can be used for approximately 24 hours non-stop + 72-120 additional hours with the charging case (you can fully recharge hearing aid 3-5 times from the case on the go!), i.e. more than enough for a full day. The case itself is excellently made and functions exactly like Apple's AirPods case - the top half is kept closed with a magnet, inside there are two vertical slots for earpieces, charging goes through USB-C cable. There is one tiny green LED on the front of the case next to the charging port that indicates charging level and charging state. The charging case can even be recharged wirelessly if you put it on an induction charging pad, just like AirPods, which is fantastic! And ontop of this, the charging case has built-in UV light that is automatically turned on as soon as you put the hearing aid inside and close the case in order to sanitize and prepare them for the next you. This is an absolutely fantastic and unique feature that I have never seen in any other earbuds!The accessory includes 4 sets of silicone ear tips. So, it will be easy to find the proper fit for your ears. Also, you will find a USB-C charging cable that plugs into the charging base. The device is very lightweight and fits well inside the ear. The weight of the hearing aid is so light that you hardly feel it while wearing it. The amplifier has two microphones - one for voice pickup at the bottom of the stud, and another for ambient sounds at the top of the stud. I much prefer dual mic hearing aids that provide better sound pickup at different frequencies and direction. There are four modes to choose from. You simply put them in and turn them on and everything around you is amplified. The left and right hearing aids volume adjustment work fully independently - there are two buttons on the outer side of each earbud to control volume, both very responsive and work perfectly. There is also a tiny white LED on the top of the stud that shows the power and connection status of the hearing aids. The rest of setup and modes control can be done via the accompanying app, which is very well designed and very easy to use. Included manual has detailed instructions and color illustrations for the use and care of hearing aids.Now, the main selling point is that you can connect it via Bluetooth to your phone and take calls or listen to music as well, which I was really missing in other hearing aids I’ve tried before. This is an excellent feature, and they have an app that would allow you to control and set up sound modes, volume, noise canceling etc. I really love this feature. Note that these devices are not really hearing aids per-se. They are ""in-ear amplifiers"". This means that it cannot be adjusted for individual hearing loss. Instead, it simply amplifies sounds around you. People with severe hearing loss who plan on wearing hearing aids every day should consider purchasing real hearing aids. A good pair of modern hearing aids will cost you ~10 times more though. So, if you want to see if hearing aids can help you without breaking your bank, or if you have a limited budget, these can be an alternative solution. Also, many people who have mild to moderate hearing loss, not enough to require medically prescribed hearing aids, but enough to cause day-to-day hearing problems, can find these hearing amps greatly beneficial. And thirdly, if your hearing is fine but you want to hear more in quiet environments, for example when you are camping at night and you want to hear every simple animal noise around you, this will provide you with a wonderful experience.One thing that wasn’t clear from the listing description is that the hearing aids included a TV transmission unit as a bonus! When I first opened the package, I did not understand what this small white box with a button was for. Turns out, you can connect it to your TV setup as audio pass-through configuration and then you can pair your hearing aids to this small transmission box and watch TV with audio directly streamed to your ears! Wow, can it get any better? These hearing aids are the best feature wise, and they just don’t stop to amaze!So, let's summarize. The accessory is lightweight, much cheaper than the prescription one, very responsive and provides good sound reproduction. It has a noise canceling feature, which is beneficial in a noisy environment. The manufacturer says that they use 16-channel digital sound processing, which is supposed to result in better sound pickup, and I can confirm that it is actually better compared to 4-channel NR in my other pair of hearing aids. These hearing amplifiers sound a little weird at first as they amplify all frequencies the same changing the sound stage dramatically, but once you get used to it, it gets less and less noticeable. When I tried these hearing aids while walking in a forest, I was surprised to hear high notes and small whispers that normally you wouldn't be able to hear at all. As we get older, our ears pick up low frequencies but lose the ability to hear high frequencies well. Thanks to these, you can get wide and deep sounds of forest that you may have unknowingly missed.One note before I finish this review. Some people may experience self-amplified high-pitch “reverb” sound when trying these amps. It is particularly important that you use the largest earplug you can fit in your ear to prevent sound ""leaking"" from the amps that would be picked up by its mic and re-amplified causing this effect. Make sure you properly adjust the amps, and you will not have this issue.*** TL;DR ***Yes, I hands down recommend these hearing aids. If you have hearing loss and you are hesitant to buy prescription hearing aids because of the cost, try these ones instead. If you currently use hearing aids, I'd recommend purchasing them as backup hearing aids. The charger is small enough to take with you on your travels. And if you are worried about showing others that you have hearing problems - use these earbuds, they look just like AirPods and no one would figure that these are hearing aids. Plus, you can use them to take calls and to listen to music on your phone! I think these are worth every penny, and unless you have severe hearing loss, I think this will solve your hearing problem in most cases. Add to it such amazing features as wireless charging, automatic UV sanitizing, accompanying app, dual microphones, 16-channel sound processing, direct TV audio streaming, and we have the winner here. It's excellent for its price. Solid 5 stars, highly recommended!+++ Pros +++1) Small and lightweight.2) In-ear buds, not behind the ear.3) 16-channel sound processing helps a lot.4) Connect to your phone via Bluetooth.5) You can take calls and listen to music.6) Can be setup and controlled via phone app.7) Exceptional sound reproduction.8) Dual microphone for better sound pickup.9) Four sound modes to choose from.10) Both sides' volume is adjusted independently.11) UV light automatic sanitizing.12) Up to 24 hours of operation.13) Have a charging case adding 72-120 hours.14) Supports wireless charging.15) Include TV audio streaming box.16) Looks just like regular earbuds.--- Cons ---1) High-pitch noise if improperly fitted (can be fixed)."
96,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,An Over-The-Counter Hearing Aid Whose Clarity Is Not Matched By Any Hearing Amplifier,"I had the Audien Atom Pro Hearing Amplifier that I was using as a temporary solution for my hearing loss while I do my research on hearing aids.I got the Nova OTC (Over The Counter Hearing Aid) direct from Linner and was pleasantly surprised that it sounds way better than the Audien Atom Pro. The Nova OTC has better frequency response and clarity compared to the Atom Pro’s tinny sound..Not only that, It has a noise reduction function which helps reduce background noise and chatter in challenging environments like restaurants, outdoors and while driving. This feature can be set through the Linner HA app (available as free download for both Android and IOS smartphones). The app makes it far more advanced than mere hearing amplifiers and yet cost just a little bit more than the Atom Pro or similar hearing amplifiers.A charging case comes with the Nova OTC that has a built-in UV lamp to sterilize the hearing aids. Very convenient.The fully charged case (takes about 1 and 1/2 hour) can charge the hearing aids (about half an hour) 3 to 4 times. So, I can take the charger box with me with no further need to connect to an external USB power source for about 30 to 40 hours total. I like that.Another thing that I like with the Nova OTC is, it looks like regular ear pods (and can also be used as such). So, people are unaware that I’m using a pair of hearing aids.Highly recommended!"
96,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome,Great for the price.  The UV feature is a game changer.  The mode feature where you can filter out background noise makes these dialogue designed hearing aid earbuds worth trying
96,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Outstanding product that makes a difference for hearing loss.,"I bought these direct from Linner on release. I already had a pair I got on Indegogo. I have moderate hearing loss and have bought several pairs of OTC hearing aids on Amazon. Originally I liked the idea of UV cleaning. I was really frustrated by my ears itching. It stopped. The Linner units quickly became my favorite because of sound quality, excellent noise reduction and comfort. I'm fairly active and while I have had hearing aids occasionally fall out of my ears no Linner hearing aid has fallen out. Feedback suppression is excellent and these can even be worn in bed. Battery life is a good 6 - 7h hours plus the case gives you several charges. In the case these charge faster than any others. I have two pair so I haven't timed a full charge but it's roughly 15 - 30 minutes. If I have just one pair and the case with me 5 - 10 can get hours. These people are great to work with too. I highly recommend these. They are no drama."

96,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Pretty amazing for the price,"With deregulation of hearing aid sales, there is a big benefit to consumers who can now buy a wide range of hearing aids they previously never had access to.At a price of $249 at the time of this review, I believe the LINNER product represents an extraordinary value.Lay me start off by saying that I am not hearing impaired but if I were I would definitely consider these as a first step.Out of the box the first impression is that it is like hearing with a high powered microscope for the ears.These does seem to be an infinitesimal delay but not enough to hardly notice.  You can hear yourself sigh and I imagine you might pick up things you’ve never been able to hear before.That being said, the quality as pure hearing aids to use for conversation or say listening to the TV leaves a little something to be desired. The sound when listening to the TV through the microphones is not as deep or rich but the volume is definitely improved.Now if you connect the wireless module to the headphone jack on the TV, it streams the TV audio to your heading aids via Bluetooth flawlessly with a deep rich highly satisfying sound, including noise cancellation. There is no discernible delay between video and audio which makes these really pleasant.TV use alone makes this a great device. It also allows you to listen privately.  I’m not sure if it would support two sets of hearing aids but that would sure be nice to allow private listening and adapting to different levels of hearing needs.The same goes for phone Bluetooth - flawless - and music sounded GREAT.There is also a mike mode on the wireless transmitter but I have but I have not tried that for conversation or listening to the TV and it’s not really addressed much in the manual other than mentioning it’s existence.The hearing aids look a lot like the familiar OEM brand that come with your phone so it’s pretty cool to be able to wear hearing aids that look like high end ear buds.The case, wireless module, packaging and accessories are world class level.  And incredibly the charging case incorporates individual UV sanitizing lamps for each hearing aid!The hearing aids are incredibly comfortable and fit me perfectly out of the box.  If not, there are a variety of sizes of ear tips provided. Also includes is a charging cord, cord to connect the wireless module to your TV’s headphone jack and behind ear clips.The app is also wonderful but it took me a few tries to connect.  Only through the app can you control the four sound modes for your hearing aid environment.  This is only necessary when using these as pure heading aids.The app also includes a pretty good hearing test for initial evaluation.  It doesn’t replace an audiologist’s test but it’s a decent at home version for your personal initial screening.I’m really impressed by this product from LINNER and all they packed into this high quality, highly functional and wonderfully styled product.Minor recommendations for improvement.  The pad on the bottom of the wireless module slipped off center but was easy to fix.  The instructions didn’t seem to address charging the wireless module - at least not that I could find.I recommend giving these hearing aids a try."
96,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Surprisingly Effective for OTC!,"My wife was born with hearing loss, and I have learned quite a bit about the life of a deaf person as a result. She copes so well due to high-end hearing aids, and most people have no idea that she wears them. They fit completely in hear ear canal and disappear from view.These aids are more than just earbuds. When ON, they continually provide sound from the environment via an always-on microphone. They fit well for me and didn't feel like they would fall out.The sound quality is pretty good, compared to others that I have tried. While the surroundings are amplified, they don't sound completely artificial. It's a unique feeling to wear them because you hear your voice through amplification and not just in your head--so it sounds like you are talking to yourself on the phone.There are four built-in equalizer modes that tune the sound either to dialogue, driving environment, outdoors, or restaurant. Each one provides a different curve to deal with the amount of background noise. Each bud can control sound independently, and you can hear music from streaming devices while connected via Bluetooth. The app also allows you to apply the volume and equalizer adjustments to the Bluetooth source, if desired. One more feature of the app is an auditory test which gives you a basic idea of how much hearing loss, if any, you have.Hearing, for me, is an essential part of life. Quality sound is important to me. If you're on a budget and need amplification with a nice, easy interface and sound equalization options then these could be amazing for you at this price. These are, in my opinion, supplemental and NOT lifestyle aids. By that I mean that someone who has mild loss and wants improved ability to distinguish sound in certain situations (movies, church, public speaking, meetings, etc) would benefit from these. If you need overall improvement in your daily life 24/7, I suggest actual hearing aids."
96,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not as versatile as I'd like,"The hearing aids were very comfortable to put in. Wearing was comfortable as well. They were quick to charge. They work very well to amplify the TV or sounds in the home, but unfortunately pick up a lot of background noise despite the adaptive noise cancellation feature. You have to be in a quiet room to hear a conversation with another person.They seem like they would better suited for watching TV or listening to music, not as actual hearing aids. The app was easy to download and use, I just wish the quality was better. One nice feature is they come with the software and hardware to be able to use them to watch TV."
96,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Comfortable, Innovative, and Reliable","LINNER Nova Lite Bluetooth Hearing Aids Rechargeable, In-Ear Hearing Aids, With Smart Noise Cancellation And Volume Control,Hearing Aids With Wireless Mic For Watching Tv For People With Hearing Loss NOVA LITE (NOVA LITE) (NOVA). I recently acquired the LINNER Nova Lite Bluetooth Hearing Aids, and I must say, they have exceeded my expectations in every aspect. These in-ear hearing aids are a game-changer for anyone dealing with mild to moderate hearing loss. The advanced chip optimizes human acoustics while efficiently reducing background noise, delivering a truly immersive auditory experience. The incorporation of ONSEMI chips sets these hearing aids apart, guaranteeing superior performance and efficiency. Beyond functionality, the Nova Lite stands out with its unconventional design and distinctive color choices, redefining the aesthetics of hearing aids. I highly recommend this item."
96,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Impressive hearing assist,"I got these particularly for home use and they work quite well. It comes in a nice case that looks and feels like just standard earphones, including charging them when in there. They of course will amplify the sound of the general environment, which I think is done quite well. Turning them up doesn't raise the general background noise, so I can raise it up without feeling uncomfortable. The amplified sounds seem accurate and not distorted to me, and it is really easy to pick up on conversations."
96,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very good quality hearing amplifiers,"The hearing aids come in a very good-quality case which look like the Apple AirPod. They are light in weight but don't feel cheap. The first thing you will need to do is download the app on your phone, go to a quiet room, and then go through the hearing test. Once the hearing test is done, it will create your profile based on your hearing situation. These hearing aids are light and small, but they feel good and fit well in my ear. I have been using them at home and during workouts, and I also listen to music with them. My first impression is that it amplifies everything, including my own voice, and it does filter the background noise. Each of the hearing aids has a volume button, with which you can adjust the level of the sound. You can charge it with a USB cable or wireless charge. The case itself disinfects the rubber part of the hearing aids while they are being charged. The battery life is good. The sound is really clear compared to other cheap OTC hearing aids. I think they are one of the best OTC hearing aids you can buy on the market."
96,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Work great!,"These are really great hearing aids and have made a big difference in my life. Once they arrived, it required me to download an app and then take a hearing test and that created a profile for me. Once paired with my phone, I took some time learning the volumes on each piece. They amplify everything, so it takes a bit of work to get adjusted to hearing a lot of formerly low sound; my voice sounded particularly loud. Once adjusted, however, and after a few days of use, I realized that I was picking up far more of conversations and background sounds than before. I keep these charging overnight; the case charges like my airpods. I think these are terrific and as long as I remember to turn my Bluetooth off when I use my phone to share videos with someone I'm with; otherwise everything works perfectly."
96,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Over the counter hearing amplifiers,"The hearing aids are awesome in sound quality and versatility. The hearing aids are shaped similar to apple's air buds, and they work in similar way as well, if not used as hearing aids. These connect to a phone through blue tooth, and then music can be heard through them easily.There is yet another great feature that allows a person hear TV easily. A tiny transmitter is added in the package that can be attached to the TV via a cable included. This transmitter gets connected to the hearing devices. The sound from the TV is sent directly to the devices without loss of signal, or addition of background noise. This effectively reduces background noise. My mother has used these and she was able to hear the TV programs quite easily and without the need for raising the volume. The charging port allows charging the aids several times over with a single full charge. The devices charge in a few hours but I tend to keep them in the port over night when the aids are not in use. The UV light keeps the devices bacteria free. Great hearing aids that do have a higher price tag but worth the money."
96,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great For Out In Public Or Home Watching TV,"In addition to being great hearing amplifiers, this package includes a small transmitter that connects to your TV. Now, you can watch TV in bed or in the living room, purely through the bluetooth earbuds, with no noise bothering anyone else at home. This is great! As for the earbuds, they sound very nice and clear when watching videos or listening to music. When used as hearing aids, they are clear, with a slight bit of digitization effect in the amplified sounds, but it's minimal and easy to get used to. There's no squealing when putting these in your ears. The volume is very easy to adjust using the physical buttons. The case is fantastic, as it can be charged wirelessly, and has UV lights that sanitize the earbuds when they're put back in."
96,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fancy Hearing Aids and More,The directions are overwhelming and to me a lot. I am not tech savvy and had to read a few times. Had to have family member help me get installed. Hearing aids are comfortable and stay put after applying. Comfortable and ears do not get sore from usage. Sound is crisp and clear with no fuzziness or interference.  Charging is easy and no worrying about battery change. Had a pair that batteries constantly needed changed and the sound was always fuzzy in my ear. Peace of mind with sterilizing case included. Have not tried hooking to television yet just getting use to the newness of aids. Informational pamphlet in box. Compact and travelable. Comparable in price and quality as similar brands.
96,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Comfortable,  well-designed","These ear buds are effective as amplifiers for people who have mild hearing problems. My aunt uses them mainly for watching TV without having to blast the volume, and  when socializing. They look like air pods , so she doesn't feel self-conscious when using them.  In fact, she feels rather modern, which I think she enjoys.They fit comfortably,  and have an app for sound adjustments.  They have a slight tinny quality at times, but are certainly good, overall.I think she will be using them more as she becomes accustomed to them.  Even just for home use, they are improving her life, because she is interacting with others more and  her television is kept at more comfortable levels."
96,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Hearing buds,The reason that I am giving these 3 stars is not because they do not work. They actually work really well at filtering background noise and they amplify voices well. The issue I have is that they want to communicate with the app constantly. So if your phone goes into sleep mode these shut off. They will turn back on after 30 seconds or so. When they turn back on its with the factory settings. When they shut off you cannot hear anything so you have to take them out to hear anything.I had my mother try them and she has prescription hearing aides. She loved them except for the on and off issue. She said they work better at filtering background noise than her actual hearing aides.The app is easy to download and is user friendly.If they did not have the on/off issues they would get 5 stars.
96,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Didn't like the app and no customer service.,"As we age, it gets harder to hear in a noisy environment. This product does amplify sound but too much of the ambient noise. The app's hearing self-test did not work. I tried calling the company several times, and it hung up each time before I could leave a message."
96,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Discreet and useful,"They work nicely, while also looking like any other pair of headphones. No one would know they were hearing aids, unless told. Very lightweight and travel friendly."
96,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great,These hearing aids are really well made and designed.  The sound quality is not crystal clear but it's still pretty great.  They fit well in the ear and are not uncomfortable.  They connect to a wide variety of things you want to listen to and they're easy to use.  The app works pretty well.  The case even sterilizes the tips when you put them back.  Overall a pretty great product.
96,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Better than Others,This is the third set of OTC hearing aids tried. These are definitely the best. Others had squealing and didn't fit well. These have no feedback noise and fit well. You can wear them and none knows they are hearing aids. They look like every other pair of bluetooth earbuds everyone is using. Easy to use. These were the best of the three brands tried but were the most expensive. Excellent for wearing to hear the TV.
96,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,They work alright,"I ordered this pair of hearing aids for my grandma. They appear to be well made, and they have many cool features. I like them, although it is hard for my grandma to fully use the features, because some features require an app on a smartphone, and grandma doesn’t use a smartphone. She can just use the basic features from these hearing aids, and she feels ok to use them while watching TV."
96,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,hearing aids earphones with modern design,"I found the hearing aids to be a more modern design and model than the Hearing Aids.They are comfortable to wear, work well and you can configure them through an app.I liked them and found them to be discreet and comfortable."
96,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect Alternative,"The media could not be loaded.
                



Right out of the box these impressed me. Now I’ve tried hearing enhancers before and wasn’t impressed whatsoever with the static and crackling in the background but with these Linner nova Bluetooth hearing enhancers I never noticed that whatsoever, you will notice if you’re outside if there’s is wind you will hear it thru these which is normal with sound enhancers . If you don’t want to spend thousands of dollars on hearing aids or maybe you just need something for watching tv or just want to listen to the birds this is definitely the perfect alternative. These automatic turn on when removed from it’s charging case and you can pair them with your phone you can even listen to music thru them but what I really like they don’t look like a hearing device they just look like the current trend of ear buds that you see so many people wearing. I very much recommend these they are very comfortable to wear and easy to use and just look good."
96,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great,Work great and do not give feedback and squeal.
96,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,No help for tinnitus,I don't have a hearing problem. I just have FIERCE tinnitus. These did not help.
96,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Expected more from them,"For the price point they are at, i expected much more from them. They are not very controllable from the app. Sometimes too loud. I wish there were more features to control on the app, as i compare it with other devices of same price."
96,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,pretty ok,It works just fine with a little fiddling on the app. The fits decent but the battery is a bit lacking as it doesn't last very long. Luckily the case charges and it's fairly portable.
96,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Capable settings and decent connectivity,"For the cost of about 300$, you do get a matched quality in terms of a hearing aid.The app is an invaluable companion to this hearing aid as it has a handy test to determine a good range for it to begin with.Then there are environmental presets that allow for levels of noise rejection. Even though this was not exactly perfect, it helped tune out a majority of unnecessary noise.Straight out of the charging case (at baseline settings) the hearing aids work very nicely in delivering good amplification with pretty good sound quality. The quality was pretty impressive for an OTC type hearing aid.The buds stayed in ear easily and though not inconspicuous, the look is pretty normalized by earpods and the like.Connection was the only thing that detached from the experience. It only happened a couple of times but one side would drop connection. A simple reset by docking and undocking was an easy fix for that.This is actually a pretty decent set. I'm very thankful they put in very helpful setting options while keeping it as simple as possible. Especially since the loss of hearing is troubling as it is for those who have lived their whole lives WITH it."
96,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great gift,"I purchased the Nova Bluetooth Rechargeable Hearing Aids for my grandmother and she absolutely loves them. She said that it's the best gift she has ever received. The In-Ear Hearing Aids were very reasonably priced and easy to use. They can last for a long time and can be adjusted to different scene modes through the Linner app to eliminate background noise. Although they weren't perfect, they were still a great purchase."
96,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Very functional!,Bought these for my 80+ year old mother and she really likes them. They make it easier for her to understand what is being said in a room without the outdoor noise distracting her I never thought I would find this good pair at this price range. I definitely recommend them. They’re easy to use and they stay in. It takes a little bit of effort to get them out of the case but that is my only complaint. I recommend them highly. Definitely gift worthy.
96,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Impressive for over-the-counter hearing aid,I found everything about these OTC hearing aids very well designed from the packaging to the hearing aids themselves. Reasonably easy to get going with these which quickly told me that they are more powerful than I need at this time so I really can’t share my experience at this time but I love knowing they are sitting on my shelf for when I do need something for more advanced hearing loss.
96,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Impressive Look and List of Features/Minor Flaws,"The list of features go on and on.  Love the look (very similar to AirPods), and they have really thought of a lot when designing these.  They come with a variety of sizes for the soft earbuds that go in your ears, to ensure comfort and fit.  The case is wonderfully designed to both charge and clean (using UV rays).  The addition of the unit to help you be able to listen to a TV that may not have Bluetooth capabilities is really smart and wonderful as well.The only negatives to point out are that they don’t always seem to stay properly paired to your device.  We’ve noticed multiple times one is not working.  It’s a relatively easy fix.  Put them back in the charging case and hold the button for about 10 seconds to do a factory reset, and then just connect to the device again.  But it is mildly annoying.  The other thing I think that is worth mentioning is you will likely notice music sounds a little “tinny”.  Not terrible…there just isn’t the depth/quality of sound there.Still, I think these are very well made, and I’m glad we got them."
96,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Quality not so good,"Sound quality is bad, I have a ringing noise randomly going on and off. Not sure if its defective or if I'm doing something wrong, but it is annoying. These are comfortable though and hold a decent charge. Worth the price."
96,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Powerful Bluetooth, Good app and Short Lived Battery","The thing that most impressed about these aids is the Bluetooth range when using the included Linner Connect transmitter. I couldn't lose the signal anywhere in my home even when multiple rooms and walls were between me and the transmitter.The app is also very good, although it takes a bit to learn its' layout. The ""mode"" switch did make a difference in the sound bias, although I would always come back to the ""Dialogue"" setting. And running the app hearing test produced an audiogram very close to ones I've had done at my audiologist's office.The audio quality was so-so. To me it came across as a bit ""tinny"" or maybe ""hollow"" would be a better term. I tried changing the treble - bass settings, but couldn't quite correct it. I'll keep trying and if I find a way to improve the sound, I will edit to my review.I like the design of the charging case and the way it functions.  And although I know nobody includes it anymore, I sure wish the charging box for the usb was included.Battery life is poor, but livable. Most other rechargeable HAs give close to 24 hours per charge (depending on usage).  These do not.So all in all, a good value for the money, but with some room for improvement."

54,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Almost unnoticeable but works well,This is a great piece of hearing device. Affordable but high quality. How little of a mark it leaves on my ear! It is practically unnoticeable. The battery is good and you can buy replacement batteries at any drug store. It helped me to hear better again.

54,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Well worth it,Has improved my hearing ability greatly. Disappears behind the ear. I have forgotten I had it on when going to bed at night. Also much more affordable. Has made life easier. Thanks Gary
54,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent product for my hearing loss,"It is, really, an excellent hearing aid.  Excellent-"
54,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,dont help any at all,no help with hearing at all too much noise
54,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Sounds awful.,Sounds like you are in a can.
54,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Need to be stronger,Could not hear
54,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Well worth the money,"I saw the overall rating wasn’t that great for these. I was shocked to see some of the negatives. One guy was complaining of terrible feedback squeals.Read the instructions and watch the videos by I hear. Insert earpiece ALL the way in your ear canal and it doesn’t do it.  If you still have trouble, go up a size on the silicone rubber plug or retainer. I have overall degraded hearing with heavy loss at certain frequencies. Working construction for majority of my life. Back hoes, jack hammers, various types of equipment having to do with underground construction.I purchased several hearing aids from prime, knowing I could return. They were from $50 to $150. in price. I liked how you put the new style into the case to charge built in battery, nice option. But none that I purchased had “realistic “ sound. Most were very tinny with no bass, one made everyone voice sound robotic, they made my inner ear canal itch like crazy. I did wind up keeping one pair that was acceptable at best, but it was not the answer. Wife was pushing me to make my purchase from the ear doctor, that was over 2k bucks for the low end model. I’m cheap and couldn’t bring myself to do it.A friend was at a thrift store and found a pair of the I hear treo new in the box for ten bucks and at a gamble got them. After a week staring at the box I tried it and I love them. I only wear one and not the pair. Amplification is good, sound realistic, they do a great job and I have no interest in looking further. The only downside is the small battery in mine will last a couple days and that’s it. If treo makes this exact model with a built in battery, I will upgrade. The battery compartment and battery are pretty small and if you have shaky hands or arthritis issues, may be a little difficult to change battery. You get a small raised plastic tab under your fingernail and pull it open , turn upside down and dump old battery and drop new battery in slot and push to latch closed. Very simple, but small components to work with. I like the fact it’s almost invisible in my ear. I don’t feel like a impaired old man wearing them. Everyone hears things differently that’s for sure. But when I saw the lower rating, I felt the need to give a factual , honest opinion. Read instructions, watch the websites videos, and enjoy improved hearing. Only thing keeping it from 5 star from me is no built in battery!!!Hope this helps,SC"
54,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product for hearing impaired!,"Just want you to know that we could have saved ourselves a couple thousand dollars if we had known about TReO before a couple of years ago. My wife started using your hearing aid as soon as we got it. You need to read the instruction manual carefully and completely. This will save you from any problems. My wife says ""So far, she is hearing better than with the much more expensive hearing aid she lost."" Would recommend to use the TReO first, before spending all your hard earned money on an expensive hearing aid. I plan on purchasing a pair as soon as we can afford it, for myself.  Jordan's"
54,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Just Distorts Sound.  Don't buy!,"Usless product. Amazon shouldn't allow to sell this product. It only amplifies the environment without discrimination, so all you hear is distortion. Every person hearing loss is different and the losses are at very particular sound frequencies only detected by a very professional sound hearing evaluation with sophisticated equipment.  Just go to Costco and they will do a free exam (professional) for you, fit you with devises according to your hearing loss, program them, give you 2 years warranty that includes the loss of hearing aids. You will probably get some good ones for a similar price than this useless product. I tried hard using the I Hear devises, but the just didn’t work for me and I don’t have a severe or rear ear loss but the most common one where the female voice and the “s” and “f” hard to get. To much money to waist on these things. By the time I figured out it was to late to return them. I wish they would apologize and asked me to return them but I don’t think they would."
54,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Quality product with affordable price,I bought the product for my father and it is great. It fits perfectly and he is able to hear the conversation in a noisy environment. Definitely would recommend the iHear TReO – much cheaper than traditional hearing aids.
54,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Product,This product did a great job for me. I can hear a lot better. the volume on my T.V. went from 45 to 20.
54,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent,I really like this aid.  Especially at this price!
54,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,not what I expected for the price,Too difficult to adjust ambvery disappointed. In the performance
54,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Ihear is out of business,Didn't fit right. Tried to get help but it appears Ihear is out of business and there is no one to help
54,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,FINALLY I CAN HEAR!,ILOVE my Treo iHear.  This was the best investment I made.  I have severe hearing loss in my left ear and now I don't.  it's amazing how much I have been missing not being able to hear until I purchased my Treo by iHear.  I will purchase another when and if my right ear goes out on me.
54,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,This works great outstanding must have one,Ok I have tried most of the hearing aid you see when you are looking for a less cost one. Hands down this is the best one I have bought. The sound quality is better then my 2000.00 hearing aid. It works great so small cant even see it. Works wonderful.
54,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,It is not a good idem.,I wanted to get a replacement because the one I have stopped working. But you do not offer that option.
54,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Save your money,"When I first tried it, while the sound quality and feedback are annoying, it did amplify the sound.  Now the battery runs out after about using it 3 times (I always pull the battery out when I am done listening to TV), the sound amplification is greatly diminished and there is continued feedback issues.  Save your money.  This is a defective design."
54,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not good!!,Pure junk I wish I can get my money backIt's not even worth explaining what's wrong with product.
54,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great little devise,Great hearing aide at a good price . Once I put it in I could hear extremely well. I didn’t even feel the devise in my ear. I think it’s going to be a wonderful help to me
54,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great hearing aid.,"I like the size, and they work very well"
54,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Bad products,Product does not work good at all
54,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,These  iHEAR TRēO Hearing aids are awesome.,"I have a pair of very small hearing aids from a hearing aid office, cost me a few thousand  dollars. These iHear Treo aids are small the batteries are a bit larger but they last a longer time than I expected. No tinnie sound, clear, waterproof and can talk on the phone.  I bought these because i perspire a lot and needed a water proof aid. I have bought a pair in the ear and rechargeable both type the sound is terrible.  I am so happy and would recommend these who may have a mild or moderate hearing loss."
54,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,They work,Hearing loss is different for people for no one suffers exactly the same tones
54,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,No response from customer service.,"Earpieces too short to fit in my ears. Although the instructions indicated that you could contact them for longer wires, none of their phone numbers worked when I tried numerous times. It was indicated that the phone numbers were not working numbers. Tried to contact them electronically with absolutely no response. Also received two different versions of their product for left and right units. Operating instructions were different for each unit. Very frustrating experience. Returned both units. Would not recommend."
54,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for the price.,"Bought for my Mom, but she wasn’t able to get them on by herself. I have a friend who has these and he loves them.  But I had to return them."
54,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,Doesn’t help eight hearing much,"I have “real” hearing aids I got from an audiologist. One of them broke and I thought I’d get this as a cheap replacement while waiting to get the other one back from repair. The hearing aid itself does fit comfortably in your ear. However, I would say it barely helps with increasing the sounds around you. Also, if you are in a group setting I found it actually makes your ability to hear worse. If you are having trouble hearing and have insurance that covers seeing an audiologist/hearing aids I would recommend doing that a million times over getting this cheap hearing aid."
54,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Works better than more expensive brands.,Works okay but takes some getting used to.
54,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,May work for some people,"These did not work for me. I don't really blame the ihear though.I have no eardrum at all in one ear, this side the ihear did not work at all on any setting.My other ear has a hole in the eardrum, this side worked a little on setting 2, butit also amplified the TMJ noise in that side to a point I could not wear it.They likely work well for some people, but I was no lucky enough to be one of them."
54,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,Hearing clearly,To improve hearing but not doing it for me thank u
54,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Not bad.,"Not bad for a less expensive way to get around without having to pay a ridiculous amount. It does, however, not cancel out noise well if you are in loud, populated areas like restaurants."

138,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice hearing aids for a good price,Just received these hearing aids. Charged up quick and I tried them on. Perfect fit. Need to play with them a bit to get use to them but so far so good. Nice to be able to hear again.
138,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Very good especially for the price,The price as well as the simple way to use them. Work well for someone with minimal hearing loss
138,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great hearing aids for the price.,Great product at a great price I love the rechargeable aspect of them.
138,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are truly hearing aides.,"I couldn't believe how much better I could hear with these Vivtone hear aides. I had to use the extra small ear domes but they went right into my ears with ease. Best money I ever spent. No more saying ""What did you say?"""
138,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,They are comfortable and adjustments are explained well.,"These Vivtone hearing aids are comfortable to wear and sound adjustment are explained.  So far, sound quality is not the best, but I hope to adjust to it, as I have in the past with previous hearing aids."
138,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good hearing aids,Exceptional hearing aids for the price
138,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Comfort good sound clear,"So far it is clear sound, easy controls,good quality"
138,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,What?,"Still a bit of echo, but I’m working on it"
138,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Happy with product,Wasn't sure the Lucid508 hearing aids were going to be the right choice for me when I ordered them. But I can happily report that they ended up being a perfect choice. They are perfect. I'm now hearing things I haven't heard in a long time. Will never regret getting them. I love them
138,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Easy to use,
138,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Quality product as described.,"Charging case is excellent. Beats 5,500.00 my ear doctor wanted for the same product with different name on it."
138,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,new user,the tinnitus feature.
138,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,I am so pleased with this purchase… These hearing aids actually help.,"I put them in my ears as soon as I got them and instantly I could hear again. I have had hearing amplifiers that worked for a little while, but are no longer useful. I was skeptical that these hearing aids would make a difference… But they did … I could clearly hear voices and music again and I’m very happy that I got them.UPDATE:  Yup...all that joy disappeared as soon as one of the units failed to charge up, and no longer works ...in less than a week.  Returning them for a refund.  Will look for a more reliable set of hearing aids.  5 stars down to 1 star."
138,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good product for a good price!,"I purchased your product for my mother who has moderate hearing loss in both ears.  So far, the aids are working out well.  She is able to hear her great grandchildren and others more clearly and is able to use much lower volume settings on her TV - settings that are comfortable for others.  I also notice that she speaks much softer when wearing the aids - which is a good thing when we are a restaurant!  Adjusting volume and mode settings is a little challenging for her but that should improve over time.  Putting the aids in and charging them have not been a problem.  So I'd say we are satisfied with your product.  We hope it continues to perform, well into the future."
138,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,This worked right away!,My husband can hear again.
138,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,So wonderful to be able to hear at an affordable cost,"I got these for me as I can't afford the $5000. Cost of the hearing aids prescribed for me. I got these and my dad tried them out and he liked them so much that he asked me to order him some too. I got the flesh tone for him and I got the silver tone as I have gray hair. You can not see them, but, I can sure hear now. It's great!"

I don't like that I can hear myself very loud, even though they are in Mode 1 and at the lowest volume. Otherwise, they are a good buy."

I purchased a set of Vivtone Lucid508 Hearing Aid thru Amazon.  Within a month I stated having issues with the aids working for any length of time. I contacted (email) Cindy in Vivtone Customer Support department. She helped with troubleshooting tasks on the aids.  We determined that something was wrong with the charging case and Cindy arranged for a replacement case quickly.  The new charging case arrived and problem solved.  Quick, Friendly, Knowledgeable  customer service. Will buy again from Vivtone. The Product works and Customer Service works....A1...."
138,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome,"Worked right out of the box. Really helps in Tinnitus mode. Better than the Audien Atom 2 Pro in ear. That's the difference, hide them, lose some reception. Don't care if they see your hearing aid, MUCH better sound reception."
138,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,comfortable and easy to use,my hearing improved
138,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Improved Hearing,These are backup to my very expensive hearing aids. They compare very well. Amplifying a bit weak. No unfortunately information on obtaining replacement tubes? Very annoying! Serious missing information.
138,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,NOT hearing aids--amplifiers,I need help hearing tv and stuff.  Thought these would do the trick based on reviews.  Once in the air they are fairly comfortable and they definitely  amplify the tv (and my wife and EVERYTHING ELSE!  Wrinkle a newspaper--yowzer! Get ice from the fridge--OUCH!  Flush the toilet--my gosh its a tidal wave!  On top of that everything sounds tinny.  They do make things louder once they are on/in my ears but they are a pain to put on.
138,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,I can hear,It came quickly and seems to work properly. I hope it last forever.
138,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Back to normal!,Very easy to set and use!  What can you say?  I went outside and listened to the birds sing.Thank you!Jeffrey Writtenhouse

138,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Vivtone support,"Cindy from Vivtone support, ask me the right questions and I was able to trouble shoot and fix the problem. I purchased my hearing aids in November had one to fail, and they replaced with no problem and I have been very satisfied with their performance.

30,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Good for the price,I hoped to replace expensive hearing aids with these aids.  They worked pretty good in church and pretty good in restaurants.  They were ok for TV.  They are fairly comfortable and small and discreet.  The volume and settings controls are good.  I loved the charging system- I charged at night and could charge for two or three days without plugging the charger in.  Customer service exists and is good.  I returned these after a couple of weeks because one of the aids completely died and there were several issues that kept these from working for me.  I did not get clarity in speech especially with female voices.  But all sounds were less than sharp.  I also had trouble with the fit causing the hearing aids to lose their seal quite easily.  When the seal is lost you get a lot of feedback.  Also I could not use the higher volume levels without feedback.  So that is my perspective and I would say that my free trial was worth the shot but ultimately I will end up with something more expensive.
30,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Better than my expensive ones!,"I originally purchased the Atom Pro a couple of years ago and I loved them!  I ordered the Atom Pro 2 because I liked some of the new features.  WOW!! What an improvement to an already great Atom Pro.  4 different hearing ""modes"" and 5 preset volume settings make the Atom Pro 2 well worth the the purchase price.  Super easy to change mode or volume setting with the press of the button on the end of the unit.  Very small in size and that makes them almost invisible when you wear them.  I experienced absolutely NO whistle or feed back from them.  Fast recharging requires simply placing them in the portable charging case which can be also be used to recharge the hearing aids while traveling or if power is lost.  It would be nice if they were blue tooth compatible but sure isn't a deal breaker.  One of the few products that I have recently purchased that I truly felt I had ""got my money's worth"".  They are a bargain!!!UPDATE!!!!!!!Bad news.  One hearing aid quit after 2 weeks.  I was actually wearing them when it made an audible ""click"" and shut down.  Would appear to charge normally  but would die in 30 seconds.Good news!  Called customer support who were super helpful in testing and then issuing a return label and immediately sending a replacement.  Received the replacement in 3 days and returned the defective unit.  One of the replacement units appeared to be defective but after discharging completely and recharging appear to be working properly now.  Again, customer support was excellent!  I suspect dirty charging contacts were the problem.  Overall great customer service and support for an excellent product.UPDATE TO THE LAST UPDATE>>>>>>>>>>>>>>The replacement unit was, in fact, defective.  Called customer support and they immediately sent a replacement unit.  3 days later USPS says they had been delivered to the mailbox.  NOPE!  Never got delivered!  Again called customer service who again immediately sent the replacement.  Received the replacement unit (Again)  promptly and well packed in 3 days.  Plugged them up until they showed a full charge and put them in and we're back in business.  I can't say enough good about the company, their product and certainly their customer service.  Audien turned a situation that could have been miserable into an example of the way a problem should be handled!  I wouldn't buy a product like this from anyone else!"
30,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great value for the price,"I'm used to BTE hearing aids so this requires a learning curve. It functions well, as advertised; good sound quality, noise cancellation works well enough, the different modes really are different (unlike some cheap aids I've used!), and it's comfortable to wear.After a week I only have minor quibbles; the start sound level is 3 of 5 and I would much prefer it start at 1 of 5 because that's my preference, and each startup I have to go thru the louder levels to get it back to 1 which may trigger some squealing. Also it's very sensitive to touch so it's easy to change the setting when I'm trying to find the sweet spot in my ear, or change modes. Oh, and it doesn't turn off, and I wish it did for loud chores like vacuuming or mowing.All in all I think it's a great value for the price, I'm pleased with the quality, and I would recommend it.This review is my opinion based on owning and using the Atom Pro2 hearing aid, and reflects the same ""review"" I posted to Audien."
30,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,New device for me.,I just received this today.  They came within 2 days of ordering. They were beautifully boxed with easy to understand instructions.  While I'm just getting used to them everything seems to be working great.  It took no time to adjust them to the point of what sounded good to me.
30,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very Comfortable and easy to wear.,"When I received the hearing aids I had problems with them whistling in one of my ears. No matter what I tried it just seemed to work only for a few minutes. The online videos were good to a point, but their approach didn't seem to work for me. I got other ideas from some of the other reviews on YouTube.It was also very helpful to talk to the Audien customer service people. Liz who signs her email responses(Liz - Mother of three, Dungeons & Dragons enthusiast, coffee aficionado) spent a lot of time helping me work out what I needed to do. I gave them a 4 out of 5-star response on the Noise Cancellation because it seems to enhance all sound including the so called NOISE. This is a huge improvement over no hearing aid."
30,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Very easy to set up. Sound options impressive,"I just got these and they seem to be worth sticking with. Fit well(various ear buds...that's up to you), charging and the case for devices very nice. It could use a small single case for charging case, and accessories(currently keeping everything together on a pint size zip lock bag...not ideal), sound 1-5 very easy to operate(No more taking the devices out and using a tiny screw driver to adjust) it's all done with ONE button on device while in your ear...great solution, there are 4 other settings for various environments...also very easy to access with one simple button. Right now just getting accustomed to the sounds I hadn't heard in a long time. Definitely think I made a good purchase."
30,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Didn’t work for me,"Updated 6/28:  I returned this unit, it was received at Audien on 6/20. I still have not received a refund, and my last emailed asking for status was not answered.Yes the unit is fairly small, and light weight. Instructions were simple and clear. The beeps for changing volume and mode were clearly defined and audible. It came with several sizes of ear domes.This amplifier gave me squeal and feedback every time I moved, spoke, or bent over. Every time I adjusted the volume or mode, I got loud squeals.I’ve been using a BTE unit from a different company for years. I understand getting the fit, and adjusting to wearing can take a few tries. This unit simply wasn’t right for me.I changed ear domes to a different size. I rotated the unit in my ear. I tried the other unit, in case one was defective. I adjusted volume and mode. As long as I didn’t move my head, or speak, I could hear clearly, and sound was amplified nicely.I also did not like the volume control. You have to cycle up through all the setting, 1 through 5, to lower the volume. And it squealed all the time I was clicking through the volume.The customer service people were very nice. They were easy to understand on the phone. I had to disconnect my first call, before I ever reached anyone, and they called me a few hours later to see if I needed assistance or had questions. Very good attention from them. I asked for a return label and refund, and they quickly emailed a label and confirmed they would refund. I had a problem with the label, called back the next day, and they emailed a new label.Excellent customer service."
30,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Whistling. Poor control switch position. Customer service reached out, did their best to resolve.","Review of Audien ATOM PRO 2 Wireless Rechargeable OTC Hearing Aid, Premium Comfort Design and Nearly Invisible @ $289.00UPDATED 6/28/24: Customer service reached out and went above and beyond to resolve the issues I had with this product/brand. I originally posted 1 star but added 2 stars for the customer service.I have mild hearing loss in one ear and moderate in another. I have been to an audiologist. I cannot afford the big-name hearing aids, but I have tried the Jabra Enhance, Sony’s, and Bose. I prefer the in-canal hearing aids so that they do not interfere with reading glasses like the behind the ear types. Plus, in-canal hearing aids are more discreet. I was pretty pumped about trying these Atom Pro 2’s since they had mostly good reviews and were the updated model.I tried all of the hearing aid domes. They come with 3 sizes of rounded ones and 3 sizes of more cone-shaped ones. The cone-shaped ones came closest to the best fit. I never could get these things to stop whistling! It did not matter which domes I used. Nor did it matter which settings of volume or environment that I used. The controls on these things are in a horrible position. To place them in your ear you have to push them in. Well, the environment/volume settings buttons are in the very position that one must place their finger to push the things into your ear canal. They do NOT have an on/off switch. They come on as soon as you remove them from the charging case, and I believe you are given about 2 seconds before they activate. If you have to reposition them a little or re-seat them some, you will inevitably change the volume or environment settings. Each quick push changes the volume to one of five settings and you must go through all five to get back to number one. A longer push changes the four environment settings with each subsequent push.They were comfortable, but the whistling was incessant, and random at times. I never was able to wear them long enough to really try them out due to the whistling. I contacted customer service for help. I explained the problem I was having just as I did here. I received a response after about half a day or more. The response was indicative of them not thoroughly reading my request for help. I got a response that was fairly generic and blamed user error (in placing things or my hands too close to my ears or needing to adjust the volume down or the environment settings). None of these things caused the problem. I did not notice any noise cancellation. I returned them."
30,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Audien ATOM PRO 2 Wireless Rechargeable OTC Hearing Aid,"These were ordered for my wife since her prescription aids just stopped working. They seem excellent as she can hear good with these. She actually has a bit more than mild hearing loss, but she said they worked fine for her. Unfortunately one of the aids stopped working properly and when I tried comparing to the other aid it started to do the same thing. Just would not amply the volume. I contacted Audien and was treated very well by Karina. She offered to replace or refund. We chose to replace. New ones showed up today, Friday after I called during the weekend. Excellent service. My wife will still need full prescription aids, but these are fine in the interim and to keep as a spare. Her other pair were $4800 top brand hearing aids and we have no idea why they quit. We decided we wouldn't even attempt to have them repaired. For the brand and money they were always having one issue or another. Amazing how an aid for a fraction of the price can still do the job."
30,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Item is Misleading,I bought these and expensive thinking they would work. After 4 weeks of adjusting for hours they are horrific. It was a few days past my return option so now I am stuck with these which I have to throw away. Please do not waste your money. The warranty by the way is 30 days.
30,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Amplifiers not hearing aids,These are amplifiers not true hearing aids. They are simple and work but have background noises etc. not a good fit in both ears one popped out when wearing them as my trial.  The level button is on the end so have to reset every time. Volume not right
30,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Poor buy,These are not for people with hearing loss.  Only good if you have fair hearing and can get along with out them.  They amplify but are not “hearing aids”!
30,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,I can hear!,I have needed hearing aids for years but could not afford them.  Not  being able to hear conversations and having to rely on close captioning to watch TV prompted me to give Audien a try.  So glad I did!!
30,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Did not fit my ear canal and pressure caused the unit to continually whistle.,I could not find a comfortable fit.  Goldi at Audien worked with me to exchange the Atom Pro 2 aid for a behind the ear pair that should eliminate the discomfort and the whistle noise.
30,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Volume control and UV Sterilization,"I bought this for my fiancé and he really likes them. The volume control is his favorite. At work, he can turn the volume down enough that his ears are not overloaded. There is a brush included to clean the hearing aids if needed but the case provides UV sterilization. That is definitely a huge plus! And they are small enough for a comfortable fit."
30,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Work surprisingly well,I bought these for my Dad and was very pleasantly surprised at how well they work. Good at filtering background noise instead of amplifying it. Very good customer service. We had issues with feedback at first but they were very eager to help. Great product for anyone who can't afford regular hearing aids.
30,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,They are comfortable and easy to use just have to get used to them,I have a little lose of hearing and I could not hear little things but I can now. They are easy to use and I am getting used to them and for the price they are a great value
30,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Being patient and following the instructions,Just purchased the Atom Pro 2 and am quite pleased with their performance so far.  I dislike having to wear hearing aids but happy I can hear people and conversations without having to ask them to repeat what they said and also now hear the TV on a much lower volume.
30,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great value,I love being able to hear things that I never heard before.
30,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent Product,Great hearing aids for my wife
30,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,improved clarity,"I'm experiencing improved clarity, volume. The devices are comfortable in my ears."
30,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,I can hear out of both ears now.,"Several years ago I had surgery on my right ear to correct an infection. This left scar tissue over my eardrum and was not able to hear out of this ear. Using the Atom Pro 2 amplified the hearing in my right ear where I can now hear out of it . I am able to tell the direction of where noise is coming from. Now I have to get out of the habit of saying huh, Thank you."
30,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Ease of setup and use,"After reading all the literature that came in the box installation and adjustment was very easy. First day so will have to reevaluate after getting used to them in 2-3 weeks but they seem very good for now. Wife says ""selective"" hearing is gone! Value for the money is excellent!"
30,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Won't buy again,I still periodically use one hearing aid.  The other one popped out of my ear and into water and their warranty does not cover water damage.  Other than irritation about the warranty the one works okay.  I do have trouble identifying a person from the sound on the hearing aid.
30,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Hearing better,"I am still adjusting to them after only two days. A bit disorienting, but I am definitely hearing better. I need to adjust placement in my ears for best fit and hearing. My own voice is louder. But I am hearing better for sure and I think it's only a matter of time before I get used to them..."
30,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Works,Had to choose conversation or television. Wish there were more of the small tips or at least info where to purchase just the small ones.
30,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Easy to set up,"I lost my first hearing aid and I needed a new good one, I have been wearing it for a few days and I am satisfied. Very easy to set up."
30,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Easy!,They are amazing and really easy to use. I've had ultra expensive ones in the past and these are MUCH more useful.
30,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Big Improvement over my present hearing aids,My former hearing aids were fading in terms of effectiveness. I decided to give this a try.The RX guys talk down OTC hearing aids but the improvement was immediate and I really like them.This is only Day 2 and I hope this lasts in the long term!
30,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,The product is comfortable to ware and does amplify sound,I am 72 with hearing loss. This product was reasonably priced considering a hearing aid from a brick and mortar store is much more expensive. The only issue I have because I just received the product is you have to adjust the 1 or 5 hearing levels to meet your needs. The adjustment is very easy and is done while the product is in your ear with one finger touch. But not quite used to what levels I like for maximum efficiency
30,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Read the instructions more than once.,My gentleman friend found it hilarious that I wore these upside down the first time. Once over that hurdle they work quite nicely. They charge easily ( right side up is helpful for this part too)
30,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very good product for affordable price,"""I bought it for my elderly mother and she likes it a lot. They are simple enough to operate, so it didn’t take long for her learn how to use it. She uses them mainly inside the house. From time to time there is some whistling caused by interference, but overall she very satisfied"""
30,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Worked but had trouble with sound quality.,"I have used these hearing aids since they were delivered. I found them to be as effective as the others I have tried but the sound quality was distorted. Every time I inserted them, the level would be affected, so I was always changing the level, and I found level 3 to be the best for me. I have since found another pair of OTC hearing aids where the sound is not distorted, and they give you a six-month trial period. Because the trial period was so short I will have to keep these and consider them a waste of money. I highly recommend that when deciding if you want to keep them or not the trial period should be a minimum of three months. I am an experienced hearing aid user, but for new users, you need more than 45 days, I needed more than 45 days!"
30,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,So far so good!,I just received them today so I know there will be an adjustment period.  I tried them in straight out of the box and they were charged to my surprise!  I put them in and had them on  level 2 and everything was super loud to me but extremely clear!  lol. Also another plus the charging box also sanitizes them!  5 stars!
30,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,One quit working after one month.,"They are not like traditional high end hearing aids.  Basically, they are audio amplifiers with noise cancellation.  They cannot be tuned to enhance specific hearing frequency deficits.  I got mine one month ago.  Once you figure out how to insert them so there is no screeching fr I m feedback leaking past the ear canal inserts they work pretty good... better than any other similar product I have tried.  Unfortunately, after only one month, one of them quit working.  The Audien folks were very easy to work with and I am waiting for replacement."
30,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Clearer hearing,These hearing aids Atom Pro 2 fit in my ear much better. I understand the setting better than other hearing aids and they give you so much clearer hearing more like natural hearing. I like the UV feature that sanitize them and the case is so easy to use. The aids clamp in the case and charge. Easy for older fingers. Very good value and easy to use with better hearing.
30,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Audien Atom pro 2,I just received the hearing aids today.  They feel comfortable & I am able to hear the TV without turning up the volume so high.  Seems to have quieted my tinitus a little.  So happy they are rechargeable.
30,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Work really well,Just like hearing tv without having it turned all the way up.
30,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Hearing improvement,"I like the comfortable fit, I am still getting used to the tone of the sound and I amazed at what I hear now, even on the lowest setting versus what I could hear before"
30,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,They work,You have together them settled in your ears just right or you will get you will get feedback squeals but once you get that done they are great.
30,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Performance and quality,Product working very well after two weeks.  If this holds out for a year +.  I will purchase more of these.
30,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sounds!,"I did not realize certain things made sounds until today. This is my first day using the Audien ATOM PRO 2 and I love this! My head hurts a little from getting used to sounds. I never realized how loud I was,  or how loud other things were. These hearing aids are comfortable,  and such high quality. I highly recommend these to anyone who is on the fence."
30,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Able to hear!,"Small, discreet, provides hearing so I can watch TV without blowing others out of the room. Don't need to have anyone repeat themselves 3 times! Good product, good price."
30,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good product at a decent price .,They work well and are fairly comfortable compared to other products I have tried .Being rechargeable and the UV cleaning station/dock are nice additions !I wish they were smaller but maybe the next models will be . I’m not a big fan of behind-the-ear products and these are best in-ear I have tried.
30,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Hearing aids,"I am not sure about these hearing aids yet. At the moment I am finding that I have more of a surround sound going on in my head. Or like I am talking into a microphone. If this is a normal thing, I wish they would let me know. I am hoping things adapt to a more normal sound in a few weeks. I personally wish they were even smaller because my one ear and canal seems smaller than the other. One fits so nice and the other hurts. I have yet to call and talk to someone. I haven't had them a week yet."
30,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Still On the Fence,"I've only had these a few days, do my final rating could go up or down depending on the results of the next few weeks. They certainly do amplify sounds, but I'm not sure that they clarify conversation/speech in TV programs to the extent that I anticipated. Maybe it's just a learning curve. We shall see . . ."
30,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,I can hear again!!,"These are great. Volume and mode easy to adjust, plus I hear things that I thought were lost to me, it's hard to describe but I love them!!"
30,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great hearing aid!,Product is working great so far. In the 2hr trial period and I am hearing things I didn’t know I couldn’t hear!
30,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Beyond Expectations!,"After discussing how the FDA approved OTC hearing aids, we finally convinced my almost 100 year-old Mother to try the Audien Atom Pro 2 hearing aids after I carefully researched several brands and read pages of reviews.  Not only did Audien come out ahead on every site, the specific questions my Mom had were answered in detail.  The website was very helpful and we understood the features and differences among products after a few minutes.  As soon as Mom agreed, I placed the order and she was excited about receiving them before her 100th bday party in 3 weeks. The fact that they were fairly priced (she didn't feel right making a major investment at age 99), could get them without going to a doctor for fittings, etc. and had a 45-day trial period made her confident.  When she received them and began wearing them, the difference was significant and amazing.  I tried talking to her from different distances and almost cried when she was able to repeat exactly what I said.  My Mom is very social and it was really upsetting her to feel left out.  Audien worked for her and my family is so grateful she will be able to enjoy conversations again."
30,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Brain requires a learning curve for a few days,Comes with all you need to start. Read material. Also arrived next day via Amazon purchase. Made & sold in USA. It requires patience with the tiny size vs fingers & ear canal size. It has been a blessing & am grateful I chose Audience Atom Pro2
30,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Cheaper alternative to costco hearing aids,"It's been a few days, it's better than expected.  A viable alternative to Costco haring aid offerings.  The fitting part takes the longest.  So far so good."
30,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,More Than Expected,"If you have had hearing aids you know what to expect. So, that said, I'm very happy with these. I returned the Eargo ""Link"". The volume was so low, I hardly noticed any difference wearing them. Bottom line: for around $300 dollars (including tax and 2 years ""Protection"", the ATOM PRO 2 can't be beat. ( I've found anything cheaper and the squealing feedback is horrendous )"
30,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Hearing again...,I love how small they are because no-one can tell I'm wearing them. They are so comfortable I forget about them. The ability to adjust the volume independently so great.I do wish there was an application that would allow me to adjust my aids settings without having to touch them while in my ears for days my fingers feel clumsy or when in public setting.Great purchase.
30,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,has simple volume changes & four different listsening modes.,has multible different volume and multiple location choices
30,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,'What hearing aids?'...,"... is what I was asked from a coworker. Nice to hear.  These ear pieces are very nice and having small ears, these are fitting nicely in the canal with little IF any visibility.  Im only giving 4 right now because I'm finding it a little bit challenging adjusting the volume and the modes without affecting the other. But I'll get use to it. It's only been a week but I'm adjusting and very happy I've made this purchase."
30,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"That I can hear things I have not heard in awhile i.e., birdsong",I have only had this a few days and I must say I did quite a bit of research before deciding to buy them. When first received you must break them in so to speak and only wear the recommended hours for each week.  I am positive that the success I am looking for will be achieved. I was distressed when after having my hearing tested I was referred to a company the hospital has a contract with.  I was unhappy that I would not be able to choose a vendor. The one that I was referred to listed a large co-pay in addition to insurance. I am happy with the cost of Audien and so far the process is going as is expected.
30,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Impressed,The unit came with very easy instructions to follow. I had it in my ears and using in no time. I was impressed with the clarity of the sounds I was getting thru the units.  I must mention that I had slight to moderate hearing loss so one’s reaction to the unit may vary. For people with my hearing situation … it’s a great value for the money. I try this before investing thousands of dollars on hearing aids .. This is a plug and play type of device
30,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Being able to enjoy a group conversation.,"No dislike so far , only had them for a few days."
30,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,good qualtiy for cost versus high end $$$,86 yrs old & background noise is an ongoing problem so far so good
30,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Easy to setup,Great product. The difference is like night and day. Good sound and easy to setup
30,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,4 stars so far,My boyfriend got these because he's been hard of hearing for years and the expensive pair through Miracle Ear didn't do much. We got the cheap $100 pair of these Audiens and those already helped more than the ones custom made at Miracle Ear. Decided to upgrade to this Pro 2 version in hopes it will be even better than the $100 pair. I will update once he's worn them for a few weeks.
30,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent OTC option,"Does not have enough control over volume.  Even the lowest setting is too loud.  Lots of feedback noice on every setting.  Still even with these limitations, not a bad buy for the money and not batteries to change"
30,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,great item for a great price,use for 2 or 3 weeks to get used to them. for me the first week was ruff mainly hearing my voice. by the beginning of the third week my brain got used to them and now I'm really glad I selected this one.
30,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great hearing aid and greater price,"So far so good. These earring aids have exceeded my expectations considering the actual costs.I would highly recommended them!Philip MuldrowCedar Key, FL"
30,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,It will take awhile having it in your ear if this is the first time you are using a hearing aid.,"I use this product for my left ear, and eventually my right, as many years in the shipbuilding and aerospace industry working on the shop floor as Liaison for Engineering, I was exposed to a lot of noise. Hearing protection provided was adequate, but noise still bled through. I am now 77 years old and age and previously noted noise is making it harder for me to hear my Classical Music, something I am addicted to."
30,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Convenient and Easy to Use,"I did hours of online research, looking at many models of CIC (completely in the ear) hearing aids and then carefully reading many, many reviews before purchasing these hearing aids.Upon arrival, they were well packaged and really easy to use right out of the box. With them in your ears, all you do is press to obtain the volume and the mode (TV mode, mode for noisy surroundings, etc.) that you prefer, much like using ear phones. I thought they were excellent because they were so easy to use. Also, they seemed to fit very well.The only thing that I did not like was the prominent appearance of the hearing aids themselves. To me they appeared as though I had a beige plastic marble in my ear. This may be due to the type, size, and shape of my particular ears. Being female, I may have ears that are somewhat smaller than a male's, making the hearing aids appear larger.Unfortunately, Audien does not provide a clear photo of this particular hearing aid in someone's ear. No matter how many photos I tried to obtain, I could not get a side view of this hearing aid in the ear.It seems that many companies do the same thing."
30,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Size,"Well, I have a difficult time getting the volume to be consistent in each ear. The round thing I press is touched when  I try to press them in my ear. Then they go up in beeps from 1 to 3 or more. That causes them to buzz and I have to take them out. I wish there was a way I could set them on 1 and they would stay on 1 until I placed them in my ear."
30,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Results in 2 Days,"I just received the Audien Atom 2 Pro hearing aids 2 days ago and am in the beginning of the adjustment stage. In this time, I am thrilled with my results. I can hear the TV at a volume lower than my spouse. I can also hear my spouse without having to ask him to repeat himself, or saying back to him what I think he's saying so he knows I am hearing him correctly. This is such a blessing. I can't wait until I'm fully adjusted to these. Wish I had purchased these years ago!"
30,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Good but not great,"My wife bought these to replace her Kirkl@nd hearing aids while out for service.  They have 5 volume settings and 4 modes.  They work OK but not as good as her regular hearing aids that she is used to, as I would expect.  Still, an economical choice for a maybe first time user."
30,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Rechargeable,"Delivery after ordering was incredible, 1day, and packaging was great. The hearing aids are comfortable and charging the units couldn’t be easier. They work as well as my$1800. pair that take replacement batteries."
30,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Hearing Aide I have ever used HIGHLY RECOMMEND AUDIEN HEARING AID PRO 2 hearing aid to everyone,"I love the sound quality of my Audien Atom Pro 2,so much better for me than the expensive Beltone ones I had. I wish I had found these sooner, you can't beat the quality, their customer service sets the bar high for all companies to follow."
30,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Nice to be able to hear my grandkids again,I have used my hearing aids for about a week now and am wearing comfortably for a full day now. It’s nice to be able to hear tv and conversations right the first time.  The more I’m wearing the better I’m getting used to hearing things again. I’m no longer asking the grandkids to repeat 3-4 times slowly 😀
30,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Didn’t help tinnitus,"I bought the Audean Atom Pro 2 hoping it would alleviate or eliminate my tinnitus.  Unfortunately, it did not help.  Audean Customer Service agent Goldi was extremely helpful in getting my refund credited after it was determined that the USPS had not shipped my Return package which i had deposited on April 12.  Goldi’s assistance was above and beyond anything I could have expected as she tracked my package and determined the problem while securing my refund.  She provided excellent, professional customer service!"
30,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Highly recommended,"I was hesitant to buy these hearing aids, the price seemed too good to be true compared to other options. They fit comfortably and I find myself not asking friends and family to repeat themselves anymore. I genuinely feel like I can start taking part in my life again. I started to recommend them to friends and family as well. I hope this review can help someone in their decision!"
30,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,IT WORKS!,I had a meeting Tuesday night and another on Wednesday afternoon. I heard EVERY word! Four of my friends have now bought them and received them. They are as pleased as I am.
30,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,New hearing aids,Easy to order via Amazon. Looking forward to these since they replace a cheap set that lasted 60 days. You get what you pay for... Hope these will be as great as they are shown on your website!
30,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good customer service at Audien,Chelsea at Audien took care of my request quickly and efficiently!!! I have had a good experience with Audien products and look forward to more!
30,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Well worth money!,"After wearing over the ear hearing aids with glasses, which is difficult at times, I have found if you take the time and have patients to adjust the Atom2 to your specific needs they are a great product. The noise canceling works well and for me hearing the television is a joy. The only thing I found a little difficult was stopping the feedback in the beginning. After pricing hearing aids up to 5000.00 dollars the Atom2 is a very good value."
30,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,They really work,"My wife is one of those people who can do it wrong hundreds of times before doing it correctly. She had very expensive hearing aids that she couldn't put in correctly and of course could not hear much better with them then she could without the aids in.  She not only put these aids in correctly the first time, but she could also hear the TV, even me without me yelling at her. They are comfortable, work great and she is happy with them. The only thing is no blue tooth but not sure that makes much difference.  The only complaint is no real information on how to use, how to change volume controls, etc. came with them. Most of this is easy to figure out but would be nice to receive some kind of information on functions of the hearing aids.(My mistake, there were instruction/ information included and was very helpful)"
30,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Atom Pro 2 side to side comparison,"I am a frequent fire from audien I have purchased the atom pro (multiple times) and the atom pro 2. Once I received the item pro 2 I did a side-by-side comparison between the two they both are great products for the price, very easy to use the sound quality is great , they fit comfortably in the ear. Also the battery life on the atom pro 2 by far exceeds any other hearing aid I've tried I can use them for up to 3 to 4 days until I have to charge them. I'd like to think Bryce for his help from Audien... He is a great asset to their staff."
30,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Get Better Instructions,"So far, this product is good!  I've only had it 4 days but I needed to get this initial review out.  The instructions that came with the product were woefully short of the necessary information.  I don't like getting on the phone since I'm hard of hearing, so I went to YouTube.  There is a thirty-minute video on YouTube that tells you everything you would ever want to know about this product.  In thirty minutes, I went from total frustration to successfully wearing this product.  YouTube @hearing club."
30,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Domes not small enough.,"I purchased these for myself and was very pleased when they arrived quickly.  I ended up in the hospital and when I had the chance to try them out I  found that even the smallest caps wouldn't allow them to stay safely seated. We searched everywhere for smaller ones, but to no avail. I was doubly disappointed when I  learned that I  had missed the window to return them. I  plan to sell them if possible."
30,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not good for all types of situations,"The best that I have found for these amplifiers is for watching TV.  I'm nearly completely deaf in my right ear, but still have reasonable hearing in my left.  I have an implanted BAHA device for my right ear and would likely need to think about getting a hearing air for my left ear a some point in the future.  I wanted to try out one of the less expensive personal hearing amplifiers to see how they worked for me at this stage.  I did some online research and decided on the Audien ATOM PRO 2s because there were some good reviews. I'm somewhat ""underwhelmed"" by the results.  On most environment settings, there was too much ""mouth noise"" feedback (meaning I was able to hear myself chewing, swallowing, coughing and talking), and that came across as very irritating and distorted any external sounds, including conversations.  I tried all the settings at a number of volume settings and couldn't eliminate that very unnatural ""internal"" mouth noise.  The other irritating sound that seems accentuated by the ATOM PRO 2s is sibilance (like running water, scraping metal chair across concrete).  Those noises come across far louder than other sounds. The only environment that I find them helpful in is for watching TV.  Since wearing them, I can clearly hear dialog on TV at a considerably lower volume (for example, on a scale from 1 to 20, I went from a 14 down to an 8).  Unfortunately, not a very cost effective item to purchase just to hear what's on TV better.They're easy to use, small and are relatively comfortable to wear for a few hours.  Inserting them takes practice because of the proximity feedback issue, but if you don't need to fiddle with them a lot, a bit of squawking feedback is irritating, but I can deal with that.  As mentioned before, not a great all-purpose solution for someone with moderate to less-than-moderate hearing loss, but does work for specific sound environments, like transmitted sounds (radio, TV, movies)."
30,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Just getting started, but love them so far!",I just received them and I noticed a difference right away and I'm excited to see how they work long term for me.  They are super easy to use and adjust and I would recommend to anyone to try for that reason alone. I'm not sure why anyone would spend thousands if you can get these affordable ones that help tremendously.
30,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,This is the best one so far,I have bought from Audien 3 times. My favorite is the ION for overall sound quality but the keep dislodging in my work environment. The Pro 2 is by far clearly better than the Atom. Better fit and the button control works very well. Sound quality is very good but I haven't really tried them in mixed environments.
30,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Learning process is slow and needs the help of the manufacturer through its help service.,"The product is a hearing aid. So it is used to hear better. For the price, I think it is amazing. More tips would be welcomed. About : the best way to insert the product into the ear, trying different earbuds, and the noise cancellation, a lot of patience."
30,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Helps your ear hear!,"This has been a real game changer for me at work. Every time a customer requested service from me I could never fully understand what they were saying. I was constantly saying ""What was that""? Embarrassing for me and frustrating to the customer.  Now I can confidently respond to them and efficiently provide them the service they deserve, thanks to the Atom Pro 2! Thank you! On the downside, I would like to hear even more improvement with cancelling out background noise. It's not terrible but could be better. Other than that, it is a great product that has probably saved my job!"
30,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,My opinion is this is a great company!,"I received my hearing aids. A I liked them at first, however after about two weeks later didn’t really didn’t care for them. So I called the company, and with no hesitation they said, no problem, what is the problem. After a brief explanation they asked what I would like to do. Did I want a refund or would I like to look at a different pair of hearing aids. The young lady, (Anastasia)explained what other items they could let me try with the same privileges as the others. I decided to go with over the ear hearing aids. This was the best decision I made in a long time. These are great and as good as the units I had from another dealer for $3000. Dollars.If you’re looking for hearing aids give these people a call. MM.BILL🇺🇸🇺🇸"
30,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Easy and simple set up!,"I’ve just received my Atom Pro 2 and am loving it. Set up was super easy. I also watched the turorial online. It’s very simple to use and I look forward to not having to ask people to repeat things they said! I’m in the learning phase and trying out the different modes and getting adjusted to wearing them. Because I wear glasses I love that these fit into the ear and don’t go over the ear.I’ve been struggling with hearing for a couple of years now and these are going to great,y improve life for me."
30,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Really 4.9 stars,"Received these hearing aids a few days ago and found them ready to go right out of the box. Showed to be fully charged as received. They fit comfortably and great in my ears, and most importantly, I can 🙉. The instructions are well written and easy to follow, they suggest a 3 week learning curve to get use to them, and I strongly suggest that for anyone who is new to hearing aids or not comfortable with their use. I have been using hearing aids for several years, so I was prepared for them. These perform better than anything that I have used in the past and even on par with the prescription aids that I started with but couldn't afford to replace every couple of years. My hearing is very important to me because I play a musical instrument. And though I play poorly, it's impossible to play when it sounds distorted. Not with these, all's good now for the first time in a long time. My only problem with giving 5 stars is the answer I got back from customer support. It seems the UV cleaning feature only works when the case is plugged in for recharging. So I asked if that was correct and if the case could be left plugged in to use it. Sorry if I offend anyone, but the answer I received was 1) poorly written and 2) incomplete. After recontacting them for clarification,  I gather that 1) the UV function does only work when the case is recharging and 2) the case should not be left plugged in to extend battery life. Audien, if I have that wrong please correct me. To all, I admit that I am a stickler on customer service having worked in a similar position for several years. I guess expecting a complete answer that's easy to understand may be setting too high a bar. All in all, a great product as long as I can get them. Will update the review if they do fail or don't last a couple of years"
30,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Very impressed,"If I have to hear one more time, ""Grandma when are you going to get hearing aids!"" one more time! I have tried 3 different magnifiers and all were usless due to the lack of noise cancellation. These are amazing! The ability to change settings with the push of a button makes it very user friendly. Don't listen to the naysayers about the feedback. I had the same issue at first. Don't give up! You need to find the the correct dome to fit your ear canal. Each ear will probably be different. When you get it right it creates a little suction a settles right in and the feedback goes away. Very comfortable when they fit just right. Driving down the road the noise is deafening and with a few beeps to change setting you are good to go. No more subtitles on the TV! I'm going to use the $2000 I saved and go on vacation! Thank you Audian!"
30,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,They help my hearing.,I use them for conversation and TV. They enhance my hearing in both application.
30,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,DO NOT ORDER THIS ITEM!! SQUEELS and...good luck on your refund!! 6 phone calls already!,"I would give this item no stars! Squeals beyond belief! We made the mistake of saying Yes...send us a new set and we will return this set. Which we did. Now it's over 3 weeks later ...6 phone calls later ...and I keep getting bogus promises they will refund my $289...week after week!! TERRIBLE!! You have been warned...DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!Update...took me forever to get a refund...and a few calls to Amazon Customer service to push it through.Update: I have changed my review from a one star to a 4 star because Melody, of their customer support team, was extremely helpful in resolving an issue that my mother of 96 years had with her Audien Pro 2. Also, my mother is satisfied with the product for under $300 and does not want to shell out a $1,000+ for hearing aids that she hasn't heard are much better. Thanks again Melody for helping mom."
30,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great for the price,"First experience with hearing aids. Helps in quiet situations, still not adjusted for loud places.  Fit is good, even though they are not custom fit."
30,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Works well,"It’s nice to be able to hear again and I didn’t have to spend $10,000.00. They work almost as well as the high priced ones but without all of the fancy bells and whistles"
30,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Have looked for this for a long time.,Loved it right out of the box. Can’t believe the improvement it’s made in my hearing. Watching TV is so much better now. Just can’t believe the difference. I’ve already recommended it to friends and will continue to do so. The price and the money back guarantee of 45 days really sold me on this as well as the videos on YouTube.
30,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Work fairly well for me,"I've been using regular hearing aids for almost 5 years. My aids are ""half-shell"" and conform to my ear canal. However, they hurt my ears if I wear them too long in one day or for two or three days in a row. Plus, they haven't been that helpful lately and that really frustrates my wife. I needed a solution, but didn't have $5-6K for a new set. So I thought I'd try these. I've worn them a few days, and so far they help me hear better. They're more comfortable than my old hearing aids, but they've had one noticeable issue: for me, they generate some feedback.I hear this feedback when the aids move around - start to pull out, or when something moves my ear canal like chewing or blowing my nose. I found it helped to switch to the smaller dome."
30,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Super Satisfied,I have an irregular shaped ear. With the Atom 2 they give you 3 different sized fitting cones. I was able to find the correct fit. I also like the volume and mode setting. For the price the Atom 2 is perfect for me
30,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Update: Audien replaced these with the Behind the ear model,"I ordered these as a stopgap until I can get an appointment at Costco with an audiologist. I followed the directions to the letter. The squealing and feedback would not stop so that I could adjust the volume and tone. I called the number on the box and spoke to their “hearing specialist.” He was south Asian and I wouldn’t have been able to understand him if I had perfect hearing. The only advice I got was to insert them further in my ear canal. They were in as far as possible. Very disappointed!I hope I can get my my AmEx points and my Amazon gift card balance refunded. Another one of life’s lessons. Update below:The replacement hearing aids work surprisingly well. The company was great to deal with and graciously replaced them with the BTE hearing aids. As soon as I get accustomed to them, I think I will be very happy with them. I didn’t know until today that one of my doors had squeaky hinges."
164,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great customer service.,"Many others have stated satisfaction with their decision to make their first hearing aid purchase for three rather than four figures. I agree 100%. Some day I may choose otherwise, but for now I am completely satisfied with my Earcentric devices. I wear them to attend lectures, to watch TV, and to hold my own in noisy rooms. But what I liked best with Earcentric was their customer service. They have great customer reps capable and willing to take care of any adjustment problems one might have.  I ended up trading up to their best-selling ($200) model. They made the trade simple. I'm a happy camper."
164,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Ear tubes to short for husband.,The amplifiers had good sound but tubes too short for average size man with average sized head. Had to contact company and they sent next price up amplifiers with longer tubes which worked for 47 more dollars.  Arrived In a few days with label to return this pair. After trying new hearing amplifiers they are very good and sad tubes are just right. Would highly recommend.
164,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,I absolutely love it!,"I love my new Hearing Aid! When I first got it, had problems with the Hearing Aid because the buzzing was so loud, couldn't figure out how to get rid of the buzzing so I chatted with Amazon and right away was given a link that will take me directly to the seller! The next day, received an email from the seller representative and she helped me troubleshoot my buzzing issues and just like that was easy fixed! Awesome customer service etiquette on both end! Love my Hearing Aid! Perfect size and small that it's not visible to others! Thank you!!! A+A+A+"
164,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,These really help me see update,"My hearing has been damaged by years of heavy equipment operation.  These have really changed my life I can watch TV with my wife and not argue about the volume. I can hear her in the car . I hear birds chipping for the first time in I don't know how long. They take some getting used to and are a bit hard for me to put on , but that's not the product it's my arthritis.Highly recommend  themUpdate company promises lots of spare parts been 2 months and nothing I registered my product wrote this review nothing."
164,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,"New ""oldman"" toys","Hearing Aids are still new, but I like them so far.The only issue I have had is a squealing noise at times that I'm still trying to resolve.I'm sure that it is just getting everything adjusted properly"

164,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,EarCentric Hearing Devices Work,"Received my EarCentric, RIE-400 hearing devices March 14, 2022.  Very well packaged with all necessary accessories.  Instructions are very clear and easy to follow.  Set-up the included charging devices and allowed to hearing devices to reach full charge.  Experimented with the various ear domes and found the round dome top to be the best fit for me.  I have been using the devices daily and find they have more than enough charge to last more than 24 hour and recharge in less than 2 hours.Overall very please with the sound quality and  performance of the devices and intend to order a back-up set.  The only change I would like to see is that the two charger bases were combined into a single unit.Happy Customer"
164,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,It's the little things.,I loved that I was able to turn down the volume on the tv so much.  My family was happy too!  So far so good.
164,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,I can hear now,"These little hearing aids are fantastic!  I have worn hearing aids for 20 years and most were very expensive.  These are better than the ones that cost thousands of dollars!  I purchased a pair of less expensive ones and they didn't work.  So, you can imagine how excited I  was to get these.  They are very  clear, I can even use them with the telephone.  I would tell you if you are on the fence about buying them, JUST DO IT! You won't be sorry!Their customer service is great.  -  Thank you ""Better Hearing For Less"" please continue to make these and keep them at the price!"

164,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,I Can Hear Again,"These work very well.  I had tried an all-in-one before, but they were uncomfortable because my ear canal is so small.  These fit perfectly and are very comfortable, and stay behind my ears.  Only thing I would recommend, is that you can order new replacement end caps.. they come with all sizes, but the smallest ones are the only ones that fit me, and I wish I could order more of just the small sizes"
164,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Bye Bye sales people with those $6,000.00 hearing aids. These are worth a Million.","CRYSTAL CLEAR (at first, thought it was a ""color option"")Bought these for me. 3rd pair I ordered. First two brands were Way too big and long. I then looked for a seller that had measurements. Good move. These are the same as my old pair. They FIT. They are CLEAR, CONVENIENT and so COMFORTABLE. I forgot to take them out when I went to bed and when I woke up- thought maybe, my hearing was back!! I look forward to a great experience. Keep up the great work for us ""older citizens"".Thanks.

Being deaf in my right ear it always made me angry that I had to purchase two hearing aids.  I was a little worried about these because the price is so good and I can hear using only one aid! And when this is out of battery I get the other one!Thank you for you’re proactive approach for us with in N  3 just one ear!Cynthia N"
164,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"they are small and comfortable. Don't know there in . AWSOME , THANKS","Just got them . Wearing them for about 2hrs. after charge. Can't tell their in.

164,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Customer Support and Hearing Aids,"I have worn hearing aids for ten year!! I paid $3000 for the set I had, in 2014! One of them recently went out cannot be repaired! I do not have the money to buy expensive hearing aid at this time!!These are great hearing aids, I just need a tube with a stabilizing wire, which these do not have!! I called customer service and they are sending me an upgraded pair at no additional cost!! The hearing aids are great and I would recommend them!!"
164,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,First time to hearing aids,"Just got these in the mail and I'm amazed how easty these are to use. Just took a few minutes and I can hear again! I hear the crumpliong of paper, the clicks of this keyboard as I type this. Things that over the years have just faded away. AND I have a very happy wife to know my vocabulary isn't restricked to the word ""huh?"""
164,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fast way to communicate with family again,"I'm just getting started with these, my first foray into assisted hearing. Wow!. These things seem to really do the job. I have no basis for comparison but I expected the sound quality to be much worse. I'm very pleased with the sound quality. I'm headed to dinner in an hour for the real test. Dinner with friends in restaurants have been my biggest complaint of age related hearing loss. I hope these do the trick. I will report back in a week or so but I'm shocked at what I can now hear."
164,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Dangerous item that never should have broken this way!,"After opening the package and charging, I changed the earbuds for a more comfortable fit. When I inserted the hearing aid, it made squealing noises no matter how I tried to adjust it. When I took it out, the product broke and left the earbud and part of the receiver inside my ear canal. I had to go to the doctor to have it removed.Clearly, I am NOT happy with this product. I'm returning it for a refund.The audiologist who removed the pieces from my ear said this should NEVER have happened.I probably would have returned this product anyway. The length of the wire is very short, which was the reason I wasn't able to seat it properly and eliminate the squealing noise. No, I don't have big ears, they are, in fact, smaller than average, which means the size would matter to many people.But, I was willing to give them a try, until I had to make an urgent trip to an audiologist to have pieces removed from my ear. It's still tender, two days later."
164,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great hearing augmentation and customer service,I went with the pods attached to the HAs as they seemed fine for my ear.But then I couldn’t  stop the whistling.I called customer service who were excellent at advising me to try a larger oval shaped pod and it totally worked.These do take some getting used to esp with the volume adjuster. The customer service is tops and sent me a helpful video or how to stop the holder from falling off my ear.
164,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Price is Great and Very comfortable,"Before spending money on an expensive pair of hearing aids my wife found these and wanted me to give a trial run to see if I would even like wearing them.  I have to say for the price and comfort of these hearing aids I am not sure that I will try anything else.  These are very comfortable, easy to manage, and the price is great.  I did have an issue with them 2 weeks after my purchase, but the company replaced them without hesitation and told me anytime I have and questions or concerns to please contact them and they will help resolve it.  They are very nice and respectful.  Great Customer service."
164,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Better able to hear tv and conversations,Was a gift for my Mom and she is adjusting to using the hearing aids. She is able to hear the tv better and participate in conversations that she was having difficulty hearing prior to the aids.
164,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,U,"Hearing add is an amplifier ,noise made it hard to sort sound. Tryed them for beyond warranty period I was surprised they refunded my money , Marry was helpful and got my money back quickly . Alls well that ends well."
164,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Reasonable Price and Great Sound,"I have been wearing my hearing aids for a few days now, and have been impressed by the improved clarity and sound.  My son has already been saying to me....""Mom you can really hear me "". This has been great investment for me and my family.  I love being able to really hear what someone is asking or telling me, without having to ask them to repeat themselves.  Thank you  EarCentric!"
164,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good For The Price,"The hearing aides arrived on time with good instructions to follow in setting them up.  The hearing is not as good as my high priced pair, but they are sufficient while my others are repaired."
164,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good product for the money!,"It's a bit too lite behind the ears, need to be a bit heavier, at time it feels like it may fall off, other than that it a good hearing aids for the money."
164,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,They are small and do not show much at all if you have short hair like me,I absolutely love these hearing aides….. after years of not hearing because had two pair of other hearing aides I did not like I have finally found what I was looking for…. No batteries to fool with ….great sound and many sizes of the part that goes in your ear because one of my ear canals is smaller than the other….. great company and looking forward to many years with them
164,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good so far,Just received good so far
164,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great small behind the ear hearing aids,As a practicing E.E. I appreciate the well though out design and user-friendly software in my RIE400 units. They work well and are very reasonably priced. I adjusted to them over just a few days. They are very small and cannot be seen behind the ear. Tech support from EarCentric is friendly and knowledgeable. I called before and after purchase and they answered my questions quickly and accurately. I am very happy with their product and service.
164,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,So far so good,I read several reviews on these hearing aides and figured I would try them out. What everyone said has proven true so far. I just put them in ad they seem to work great so far.It was a littleConfusing at first to figure out the instruction for turn in and off and charging. But for the price they are working great.
164,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent product suppoert,"The product support appears to be excellent. They are handling a fit problem by sending larger ear piece. This is only day two of using the hearing aid, so we will know more as we try to adapt to it."
164,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Equal to Devices that cost $1,000 or more!","I tried regular hearing aides from clinic that cost over $1,000 each but didn't feel the price was worth it for the devices.  I bought this device with the same technology at those $1,000 and up each to be satisfied the results were the same with my hearing.  I hear as well or better than those expensive devices with this set of hearing aides.  The earbuds are easily removeable.  The recharging has not been a problem as they give hours of use."
164,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,I feel they are to big,"I hear much better, except they are to bulky. They show behind my ears. Would have liked something smaller"
164,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not much,"Too much static , can’t get a clear sound. I have adjusted all the instructions told me & they still are too loud & fuzzy sound.I should have returned them"
164,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Third attempt is a winner,"After using two competitors' products I finally gave my Ear Centric RIE400's a try. They are far superior to the last two. The sound they provide is excellent. I hear both bass and treble. The previous pairs did not allow me to hear bass sounds. The fit is also superior. They are comfortable and DO NOT FALL OFF as the previous pair did. Finally, the controls can be adjusted while I am wearing them. This provides me instant feedback to assure the adjustment is what I was hoping for.I highly recommend the RIE400's by Ear Centric"
164,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works great,"Got this for my wife,she says its the best hearing aid ever! Works really good and a great price."
164,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Ugh, the squealing!","I really wanted to like this. The concept sounds great. In reality, not so much. The ear wire is entirely too long and no matter how I try to bend it to fit, the hearing aid just keeps popping out from behind my ear. It also squeals at the slightest movement which is ungodly obnoxious. I tried every Dome that was in the package because supposedly that helps the squealing but none of them were effective. I'm highly disappointed because this sounded like a great concept. Unfortunately it is not working for me on any level. I'm going to send it back."
164,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Still getting used to them!,I love the price. I feel that this is a good way to try hearing aids without spending a lot of money. Still figuring out the levels and getting used to wearing them.
164,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Impressive,"This is my 1st time wearing hearing aids. I had no idea I was that deaf. I am very impressed.  It is like notwearing anything at all thing at all in your ear. Great product for the money. I have been wearing them for 3 days now and I find that they don't minimize the background noise,  but I contacted the seller and she helped me out tremendously. She is sending me a different kind of ear buds. She was very knowledgeable and helpful"
164,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My Mom says they are better than the $3,500 pair she previously had.",We bought these for my Mom and she loves them.  The recharging station is much easier for her than replacing batteries.  She also likes the small/medium size better than large ones or smaller ones.Only issue is the volume down and mode change are the same button and my Mom can’t work it very well.  But she loves them.
164,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Initial Impressions,"This product is working really well for my wife. As expected - and as noted by the seller -there is a period of adjustment to the device (usually three weeks or so) while your ears become accustomed to it, and we are just at the start of that period. However, we're really impressed so far:- The sound amplification is dramatic, and there is little feedback or ""screeching"". Before using them, she couldn't hear the television when it was turned up as high as possible, and now has asked me to turn the TV volume down since beginning use of the amplifiers.- The units are easy to place in the ears, and they're very inconspicuous when worn.- Possibly most important, EarCentric's customer service has been highly responsive. I had a question about cleaning the units, and the video they provided didn't answer it. Nina, the customer service representative, worked with me to resolve it. I wasn't sure how well the seller would support this product after purchase, but I didn't need to be. Again, we're just beginning to use these, but I'm greatly encouraged by what's happened so far and confident it'll continue."
164,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing value,"I bought these to tide me over while my $5,000+ dollar hearing aids are being repaired.I am impressed! Most of all the sound quality is excellent (approaching my expensive audiologist provided hearing aids). It took trying out some of the domes to get a good fit that and adjusting the volume levels so as not to have any squeal, but after maybe 20 minutes, I had them fitted. There appears to be a wide amount of volume adjustment; I am severely impaired in my left ear, but even with sound at a low level, I can hear well on the left. The right ear does much better, requiring only a low level of volume to hear clearly.For slight over $100, I am simply astounded. Time will tell how well these last.So, I am definitely keeping these as my back up set once my pricey sets comes back from repair,"
164,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,The clarity when people talk is amazing!,These make such a positive difference in my ability to clearly hear and understand people when they are talking.  My family notices that I do not say what when I'm wearing the hearing aid. I've only had them a few days and it did take some trial and error to find the tip that was most comfortable for my ear canal. The larger ones were very uncomfortable. But now that I'm using the smallest one there is no discomfort at all. I haven't worn them for any length of time in a noisy environment so can't comment on that. But based on my experience so far I'm sure there will be a bit of an adjustment period and then I probably wont notice I have them on most of the time. I am so glad I purchased these. If I'd known what a nice difference they were going to make I would have purchased them sooner.  So happy I bought these.
164,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"First Impression, Reciever in the canal hearing aids","These hearing aids use similar hearing aid technology that a relative purchased costing thousands of dollars and that are not rechargeable. I have spent hundreds of dollars on batteries over the years but not anymore. I like in the canal hearing aids but wind noise is a problem. I like to sail so wind noise is a problem for in the canal hearing aids. I decided to buy these Earcentric hearing aids to sail knowing that I could get fabric coverings to eliminate wind noise, not something I could do with in the canal hearing aids. I am truly impressed by the quality of these hearing aids AND the incredible value. For the price I don’t believe that you could find better hearing aids. They are suitable for mild to moderate hearing loss. If you are having trouble hearing I recommend that you give these hearing aids a try. I think that you will be just as happy as I am."
164,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Ear-Centric review below,Had used Miracle-Ear aids for approx 9 yrs; then Zyon RIC units for approx last 4 yrs (great experience) but Zyon went to non-RIC units presently so needed to find another RIC type as their present model not so good. Did some more research & found a review rating personal amplifiers & their top rated was the Ear Centric; still getting used to the differences but so far OK but would prefer if the units had the locking whiskers similar to the Zyon units.  Will update after more usage.
164,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fantastic Natural Sound!,"The media could not be loaded.
                



Right out of the box, without any fine tuning, hearing aids had a wonderful natural sound. They were even great using my cell phone. No feed back at all.Even ordered a pair for my wife, super picky about her hearing aids. Took a little bit more tuning to please her. She now said “they have the best sound she has ever had” we have spent $3000 to $6000 on her aids.Not just the price I paid for our new aids, they have not just the very best bang for the buck, the sound is far superior in all situations the our previous much more expensive hearing aid had!!I will recommend these hearing aid to all I know that require hearing help!! ThanksPS. The new design I believe really helped deliver the Natural sound Voices are sharper even in a crowded room or table. Superb in One on one conversations as. No more trying to read lips ! One word “ FANTASTIC “Thank Y’all so much for producing such a fine instrument !Jim"
164,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Very hard of hearing.,"My prescribed hearing aids are broken and no longer repairable so the EarCentric is helping me on a daily basis.  I cannot hear TV or radio but I can hear conversation on a one on one situation,  I can hear on the phone, there's no squealling noise."
164,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Price and quality,I have been wearing hearing aids for five years. I am completely deaf in my left ear and 80% in my right .One of my Rextone hearing aids broke so I purchased these until it could get fixed but the difference in sound quality between this hearing aids and my prescription is unreal. I’m going to purchase another set of these just in case something happens to them and never go back to my doctor and pay $6000 for a set of hearing aids again.I will add I am only on volume two With my 85% loss. I believe there are three more settings to go and I can hear a pin drop across the room not to mention people speaking in the next room over.They do not have a fake generated sound like most do they are 100% natural sound quality. I just can’t believe the quality of these regardless of the price.
164,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Should be better,"First off, these amplify ALL SOUNDS and does not help me with the low tones I cannot hear due to progressive hearing loss from Menier’s Disease.The charging docks blink CONSTANTLY and have to unplug them at night or might move them to another room to charge them.After changing out several different inserts, they are quite uncomfortable.The backing does not sit still even after adjusting them over and over.My left year is significantly worse than my right so I am constantly adjusting positions because the sound comes and goes."
164,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,EarCentric is a very good value,"The EarCentric are very comfortable and are a real value. I have not heard things this well in years. No buying batteries, just recharge each night while sleeping. It sure beats 5 or 6 thousand dollars for other hearing aids."
164,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Surprised at the quality,"Having worn behind-the-ear hearing aids for several years, I saw these with the speaker-in-canal technology and low price and decided to try them since my previous, more expensive, aid was starting to have problems and was well out of warranty. At first I was afraid I wouldn't be able to seat the larger unit inside my small ear canal, but by the second day I had it worked out. The microphone unit behind the ear does hang down farther than my previous aid, and would be visible if my hair didn't cover it, but I realize it's necessary to have a wire long enough for all ear sizes with this type.  Better than too short!  I'm finding the sound comparable to my more expensive unit.  I didn't receive the wax filters in the package but will ask for those. Other than that, I'm very pleased so far!"
164,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,It’s a new world! UPDATE,New update!!! EarCentric replaced the set and they lasted well over 18 months. I love these and just purchased my 3rd pair! I don’t think they are made to last forever but I can live with that. For under $200 I get better results than with hearing aids that cost thousands more! Very pleased!!!UPDATE: I loved these hearing aids but one is totally dead and the other is close second. I should reach out to customer service but I’m not optimistic.I’ve needed hearing aids for a very long time but they were prohibitively expensive. I had to do something to hear people at work. I tried the Bose hearing aids and they were awful. The EarCentric hearing aids are amazing. For the price I expected very little but what I received was incredible. I’m just so happy that I can hear things I never realized I couldn’t hear before. The conversations I’ve missed are a thing of the past. I could not be happier with these hearing aids. Even the packaging was designed well. The world is a much better place when you can hear!!! Thank you for designing and manufacturing hearing aids that I can afford - while not sacrificing anything you may get with hearing aids costing thousands of dollars.
164,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Pretty good value for the money,They was fairly easy to operate and they seem to work pretty good so far I've only had them one day and used them
164,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,UNSOLICITED REVIEW,"I am giving my pair of EarCentric Hearing Aids 4 Stars out of 5 at this point, simply because I have not had the chance to expose this hearing aids in a crowded environment and group conversation. In comparison to my experience with a more sophisticated $5000 hearing aids, the EarCentrics that I am wearing now are far more superior in sound quality and ease of use. I have not experienced the presence of hissing, chirping and echoes in the sounds that passes thru the EarCentric Hearing Aid. Voices, music and sounds outside are close to being normal and natural compared to the other hearing aids that I had used. Topped with the EarCentric's commendable customer service, both this product and the people behind it deserves a higher rating. However, I think that 15 days of use are not enough for complete evaluation that I decided to exercise the given 30 days trial period before I make a final conclusion of its performance.Follow Up Review:….after wearing these hearing aids for 31 days 17 hrs/day , I am giving these EarCentrics FIVE Star….bottom line, I  am a happy user."
164,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Re-review,"I previously reviewed as having received a previously opend and used product. I received a quick response and resolution to my post. Customer service has been refreshingly prompt and professional. Even though I was satisfied with the product itself, EarCentric wants to send a replacement to ensure absolute satisfatisfaction. I have been wearing aids for 6 yrs. I wore $5400 aids until they were no longer functional. I now have a greater loss in one ear than the other which requires surgery to bring the balance back. I purchased this pair as fill-the-gap pair until surgery is complete and I can be properly fitted for higher quality  aids again. These are not comparable to high end hearing aids for hearing as severely impaired as mine, but these are a great value for the price."
164,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great product, Great service, and little tips & tricks","I have had my Earcentric hearing aids for 2 months and am well satisfied with them. The advice to take 21 days to become accustomed to them was very useful to me. The 1st couple of days I was ready to send them back but remembered to give them a chance. Each day I fine tuned the settings and became used to the differences in hearing. I like the midsize closed-tip ear domes which are very comfortable and prevent whistling. However, it is not possible to avoid whistling 100%. When my ears get very close to the wall, it may whistle. As an electronics major, I understand it is normal for all microphones, not just microphones in my hearing devices.One thing I would like to share with you is that: brushing the hearing aid sound tip every day to remove ear wax build up. I did not realize that but Mary, the technical support, called me to remind me about it. Her call was just in time because I was wondering why the hearing aids were getting weaker. Once I clean it, wow... crisp clear!I can say I have arrived and am very happy. Be patient and you will be pleased."
164,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Learning to set the correct sound.,"Since I have small ears it is difficult to get in my ear canal. Takes me a while. Once in, it tends to work its way out. So I need to be very aware of this."
164,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sound is natural and clear,"My job has a public service duty for students and faculties in a library. I don't want people to notice that I am wearing hearing aids. This is not the first hearing aid that I have purchased, I bought some other brands but they are just way too bulky. I like the small size of the hearing aid. This is one of the decisive reasons I purchased RIE hearing aids, I compared this receiver-in-canal hearing aids with other BTE devices, this RIE400 is almost half of the other models.The price was a real deal. you get all the extra accessories included without paying extra. I was looking at the Mdvolt hearing aids which are more expensive. They do not come with the extra domes or other accessories, they charge extra for them. Also the fact that they are rechargeable makes them a better bargain. I put them on right out of the box, and with a little adjustment they work great. Sound is natural and I can hear my daughter clearly (I used to have a hard time understanding her voice when I talked to her; I don't have any trouble with my husband's speech though). No need for batteries since it is rechargeable, this is a big plus."
164,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good device for the money,These were my first hearing aids. I bought them just to see how a hearing device would work for me. I have mild hearing loss and having had these for 6 months I find that conversations and TV are much better than without them. My first plan was to upgrade if they did the job but now I'll just use them until they give up the ghost.
164,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Funcionan bien.,"One of my grandsons understood that my previous hearing aids were his toy. He used them and, of course, damaged them. Since it was an expensive hearing aid, I decided to send it in for repair. While they were doing it I decided to buy these, quite cheap. My famous brand hearing aid could not be repaired. I was glad I received these two. I don't plan to buy others. These two (small and light) works very well. I took one star off because sometimes, outside of my ears, they ring a bit and some people don't find it very pleasant. I waited a reasonable time to write this review. I wanted to make sure they really worked."
164,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,good for the price and for emergencies!,"well, I'm still evaluating them bought at the end of March 2024...my previous pair were smaller and more complex (Widex Beyond) so it's taking me a while to get used to the size and loudness of these, but they hold a charge well and do the trick while I try and get my others repaired. I'll update if there's a problem."
164,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,work pretty well,"part of the device that fits into the ear canal is a bit large, otherwise I recommend"
164,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Receiver-in-Ear technology w/ tiny amplifier module,"The RIE400 hearing aids use Receiver-in-Ear technology which is a feature used in many higher priced hearing devices that is difficult to find in a low priced OTC hearing aid.  Upon wearing them for the first time, I immediately heard sounds that I had not noticed for years. For example, the mechanical noise of the mouse clicks and even the clacking of the keyboard keys was now apparent. And other folks voices now have more clarity. There are two programs available, #1 for everyday use and #2 for noisy environments.  The differences seem slight and I normally use the #2 program which seems to minimize any noise.Also ordered the Earcentric dehydrator device which is a small box that generates gentle heat to remove any moisture from the hearing aids. Moisture accumulation was described as being a common problem with all hearing aids but I wasn't sure if I would need the device. After using the hearing aids for a couple of days, the left hearing aid was not indicating that it was charging. I put it in the dehydrator for a few hours and was able to charge it again. The problem reoccurred the next day and another session in the dehydrator fixed the charging problem again. The right hearing aid never exhibited any problem. The left hearing aid has continued to work for several weeks now without problems."
164,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice sound quality, especially for the price.  I use them and find them very helpful.","I am pleased with the sound produced by the Receiver in the Canal System.  (My earlier expensive professional hearing aids used a similar system.)  Product was delivered quickly and on time.  I have not required any additional service from the distributor.  Constructiion quality looks good and the internal rechargeable battery is working as advertised eliminating the need to purchase additional batteries.  I wasn't sure if the rechargeable battery system would cause any issues in using the hearing aids but I haven't found any problems in their use and now consider it an advantage.While the sound is quite good to me, I am unable to detect much difference between mode one or two or loud noise reduction.  I can set volume to a satisfactory level for me but it would be nice to have more volume level increments (currently 5) to allow for finer adjustments.  It is important to select the correct ear domes from those supplied to minimize feedback.  After experimenting, I was able to find domes from those supplied that worked for me.  While the website references accessories to specific hearing aid models they sell, I don't see that done for this Receiver in the Canal model yet.  These hearing aids are working for me, I like the price and am satisfied with my purchase."
164,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Being sure your devices are fully inserted in the ear canal.,"I like the quality of the sound(once I got it adjusted) I’m really liking them in general.Once I have them physically adjusted to the shape of my ear, I’m almost there I think) once I’m fully comfortable with fitting the outer ear. I’m going to be well pleased."
164,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Takes getting used to, but pretty good for the money","These have 2 ""programs"", normal or traffic. I suppose the traffic program is meant to reduce background noise, and the normal is for conversation. Honestly, I don't hear a difference. For me, the volume control helped with conversation more than changing programs.Also, I was annoyed by the whistling, aka feedback. In my case, sweating increased the whistling. The only was I got rid of it was to lower the volume. There is an assortment of domes that may help in reducing the whistling- or so the instructions say. The different domes are sized so you have options for your particular ear opening.These come with a nice kit for keeping them clean, which is important, but especially so, if you have an ear wax issue. If that's the case, they'll clog easily, and will require cleaning . But that's with anything going into an ear canal.In a nutshell - well worth the money. I suggest that anyone who is thinking about getting a hearing aid, and doesn't want to raid the piggy bank, to give these a try."
164,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good compared to previous expensive hearing aids,These worked so much better than the $2500 hearing aids I brought from my way doctor. Just one allowed me to hear so much better than the BOTH of my more expensive ones together. I have tiny ear canals so the fit wasn’t the best but it wasn’t something I couldn’t live with. Small price to pay to hear. And they last ALL DAY AND SOME. My more expensive ones lasted about 8 hours if I was lucky.UPDATE: I have to take a star off because I ordered mine in February and it is now August and one hearing aid is not charging at all. I also did a review on this product and they claimed that I would get a free item and I did not receive the item. I also did the registry for the product and I was supposed to get a year supply of parts for my hearing aids which I did not receive. And that was fine except for the fact that one hearing aid is not charging or working at all and I cannot get in touch with customer service. Other than that the hearing aids worked fine as long as you clean them and change out the wax guards.
164,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Clear crisp sound,"I bought these for my husband after he tried other inexpensive hearing aids and he has thanked me many times over for the wonderful gift. He said the sound is so clean and he has directional hearing again for the 1st time in years. Other cheap hearing aids had a canned sound and didn't last for more than a few months, since I have a soft speaking voice we both became frustrated with the crappy products available in our budget. I really hope they last.Edit- I originally gave these 5 stars because the sound was amazing but since writing it one device stopped working and the other fell apart. its really too bad. We were both ptpretty excited to be able to communicate againEdit- my husband was able to get one of the hearing aids working and it has a nice sound. The company offered to replace the hearing aids but I didn't respond promptly and initially I wasn't impressed with the quality of the product. Now that he has 1 of them working I would love to give them a 2nd chance"
164,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good buy,"I liked all the accessories!  I especially like the ear wax removal sticks because they are the same as I use on my Sharkey hearing aids.  The performance is almost as good as my current hearing aids, but they cost $3,600!  I bought these because I was having technical difficulty with one of the Sharkey aids after just 3 years.  I'm not sure at this point if I prefer replacement batteries or rechargeable batteries.  These aids are slightly larger than my Sharkeys so I will need to try them for 30 days and see if that presents a problem since I wear glasses.  Now I will see if the performance is as good as the nice packaging they arrived in!"
164,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,quick ship nice styling,just received order but pleased with the construction quality and the speed of receipt. will be helping mother to explore and I think these will do well. we'll see how it goes til the end of this holiday season.
164,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wow best ever,"I purchased these hearing aids for my mother.  This is the 7th pair we have tried.  She may be turning 90 but she still doesn't want anyone to know she wears hearing aids.  These are so small she love's them.  She almost purchased a pair for $5,000 which is more than her first pair but decided they were not worth it she couldn't hear well with them.  These hearing aids are amazing.  I am soft spoken and she can hear me in the next room no problem.  She had the TV volume on 27 with her old aids and now TV is on 15. They came quickly.  We did receive one that wouldn't take a charge.  I called and they sent a replacement immediately with an shipping label to send bad one back.  Arrived fast.  There are 2 charging bases which we would prefer one but an upside to having 2 is if one stops charging you can keep charging your aids while waiting for another charger. I may keep my sanctity now that she can hear well again and I no longer have to scream.  I did purchase an accessories package also.  Glad I did.  The domes that came with the hearing aids just didn't work for my mother and the whistling wouldn't stop but in the accessories case there were the perfect domes for her.  She loves them.  We did buy the protection plan also. Excellent customer service.  One call and a new aid was on it's way.  I did call again but just to ask about tracking and I spoke with Ann she was so sweet, friendly and helpful.  She said call any time with any problems.  Now that we have found the perfect pair of hearing aids for my mother I may get to have a life again probably not though because she can hear everything thing now and wants to go everywhere.  She could hear the microwave and even the squeaky water faucet outside when she was inside.  I couldn't believe it.  I would highly recommend these hearing aids.  She said they are so comfortable the receiver is in the ear which is better than behind the ear.  The sound quality is way better than we ever expected. She is at volume 1 so she has plenty of room to go up should her hearing get worse.  This was one purchase that changed not only my mother's life but mine.  Amazon of course is the best.  I like the fact that you get free shipping but also if you don't like them for some reason you also get free returns.  Everyone is different and I can only give a review based on our experience.  Our experience has been amazing in all aspects from the hearing aids to customer service."
164,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,"They are a good choice for the price, add 1 year update","I got these 5 months ago and from my experience with these aids they do compare with the expensive aids with the exception of noise canceling. I lost my high frequency hearing so hearing birds again was very nice.  The only thing that I have a problem with is the white noise, it gets very loud sometimes and the feedback can be very annoying if you get too close  to something, but all things considered, I would buy another pair if these  quit.6 month Update on the hearing aids, I dropped one of them on a gravel parking lot and the switch  cover fell off and got lost in the stones. The aid still worked good and I could turn it on and off with a tooth pick, but I was afraid of dirt getting inside. I  called customer support chat and chatted with Mary. I explained my problem and asked if she could send me a new cover. Amazingly she had 2 covers sent to me , which I easily installed and also a pulse meter as a gift for my trouble WOW! I am not use to that level of customer support, I give them a A++ for support, You can be confident that they will go the extra mile to make sure you have a good experience with them, Definitely satisfied!One year update, I use them every day and they have never given me any problems. Compared to the prescription aids, which cost 10 times more then these, I am very satisfied with them and if need be I will buy these again,"
164,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Affordable and clear.,"I have been using my Phonak hearing aids for 5+ years until they stopped working. I was on the market again shopping for a new pair. The main reason I want to stick to Receiver In Canal (RIC) models is because I had a great experience with their tiny casing, lightweight, and natural sound, especially high-pitch speech. Unfortunately, I just do not have the budget to spend another several thousand on Phonak. After comparing several RIC models available on Amazon I decided to give Earcentric's RIE400 hearing aids a try mainly for 3 reasons: 1. tiny, invisible BTE casing. 2. very very affordable (RIE400 is one of the best value models. other RICs run up to several hundred dollars). 3. customer service - whenever I make any major purchase, I call the vendor first since I do not end up with no one to call when I need a warranty claim. I called Earcentric and talked to Ninia who helped me with my questions.The comfort and amplification on RIE400 is great. Sound is natural, I can hear my wife's voice clearly. It is extremely easy to adjust volume and hearing presets, I can also adjust the best fit for each ear individually. Squelching is minimal. The rechargeable feature is a plus. I did not realize that hearing technology has made such great progress over the 5 years!  Another feature is that Earcentric devices keep the custom settings, even when they are powered off or during charging. Unlike my old Phonak, I have to adjust the setting each time. Just power them on and ready to go. So much easier!I probably will come back to review it again after a couple of months of usage. Thank you Ninia for helping me to make the right decision on this tiny device."
164,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Squeal loudly,"This was my first pair of hearing aids, and it was only a few weeks before they started squealing extremely loudly in my ears.  At first, they seemed like a bargain, beautifully packaged, and the rechargeable batteries held a charge all day and probably a lot longer.  The quality of the sound is ok for the price but it got where I couldn't wear them even with the volume down without the deafening squealing. Even using the largest domes eventually didn't help. After a month,  I purchased a pair of Jabra Enhance hearing aids for $2000, which were pretty good, and there was no squealing.A few months later I was given a pair of 2016 Otiocon OPN1 hearing aids with disposable batteries, and I had them programmed for my audiogram.  They are good, but hearing is a quality of life issue and this year I bought a pair of Oticon Real 1 hearing aids for $5000, which have great sound quality and state-of-the-art noise reduction. Now I have more hearing aids than I can use. Having gone through this experience, my advice is to buy the best set of hearing aids you can afford or need from the beginning. Make sure to go to an audiologist or hearing professional to receive a personal audiogram. Don't waste your money on these, even as a starter set."
164,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Suprised,"I have been in expensive hearing aides for years.  When I work and sweat I put them in my pocket but the darn things are like Velcro and I lost them for the second time.  I had insurance on the first go round. My first day back without hearing aids was a disaster.  I found these on amazon and they were dramatically less expensive.  Yea the sound isn't $3,500 dollars sound... but you know it was alright.  Much better than not having them.  These will do for awhile and if I loose these, I'll jump online and grab another set.  They aren't as good as my expensive ones but they will work until I can afford new ones.  They would make great back up's for your RV or to keep around the house.  This is my first time with rechargeable.  Jury is still out on that aspect."
164,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Helped me hear better and stop talking so loud.,"These are great for my mild-moderate hearing loss. I've lost my hight tones and was having trouble hearing. My family said I was so loud. I started being self-conscience that I was yelling everywhere. My tinnitus was deafening at times. I went to an audiologist who said I was speaking in much higher decibels than the average person, I did have 25% hearing loss in both ears and aids could benefit me. But at $4000, I was skeptical I would really use them. I started looking for something of quality that I could use now for a year or so until my next audiologist visit. After finding these and getting use to them in the steps they advised, I have to say they are AWESOME! Now they aren't the $4000 Bluetooth/programmable to noisy places but they have helped me a lot.Someone on a hearing loss forum commented that hearing aids and amplifiers from Amazon were junk and would damage my hearing BUT I found out by visiting a relative with a loud and shrill barking dog that my aids would momentarily block loud noises and NOT AMPLIFY her bark. So this aid actually helps protect my hearing. (What a great bonus feature!)I plan to continue using them for the next year and possibly purchasing the step up of this brand to see how I like the Bluetooth version with the noise canceling feature to use for the next couple years after that. I really have been please with the sound quality and ease of use for such a low price point.Thank you Ear Centric for making a quality affordable product for me!"
164,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,Unit has potential but Customer Service a nightmare,"Firs, I understand the limitations of a device like this.  I bought them as general use.  Took a few days to find the settings that worked for me regarding feedback, volume, etc.  The wire that places the receiver in the ear is annoyingly about 1/2"" too short.  But, for my use, it was working overall.  Then, started having problems with feedback.  After several calls, they sent a new ear dome.  It helped somewhat and I was OK with it.In early July, (about 90 days of use) the units randomly would not charge, or would not turn on.  I called in and was given and RMA and I had to pay to return them.  AND, they also sent this long email telling me that I needed to include everything, including packing paper, that was provided in the original box or it would delay or void the return.  So, I sent everything back! After a few days of confirmation of delivery and not hearing back, I called in.  Was told the units were bad and replacement units of a different type would be sent.  Told them that I had to have receiver in the ear.  I had never been able to get the others to work for me.  They finally agreed to send replacement units of the same model.  Was told they would be shipped UPS expedited, whatever that was supposed to mean.Five days they came USPS priority mail.  I open the box and all I have is two bare devices.  No domes, no chargers, nothing else.  So, I call them and their response was that I was told to only send the devices.  I read them the long email that I mentioned above.  Her response was, ""Oh I am so sorry.  I understand."" I heard that about 100  times.  After a delay, they agreed to send just the chargers.  Well, I was getting ready to leave on a two week trip and needed the chargers the next day. ""Oh, I am so sorry, I understand, we will take care of it."" So she said yes, they would send them and said she had taken care of it.  I asked if they had been sent UPS or Fedex and she said yes.  I said which one.  She said Priority Mail.  Told them that would not work.  They offered to send them to my hotel, but told them that I was not going to be in one place but multiple and sending by priority mail had no guarantee which day it would arrive.So, I was out of luck and had to hustle out and buy a set of devices.  They emailed me and offered to send the chargers and refund for the devices.  I responded and did not hear back for ten days.  Just called them and they claim to never have heard back from me and that they had tried to call me many times.  All not true and documented.  So, once again they claim to be sending a refund, but I will not hold my breath."
164,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,The RIE400 Makes Listening Easy,"On June 3, 2023 I purchased hearing aid pair EarCentric RIE400 and have been using them for 2 weeks.These hearing aids are great.  It took a little testing to select the appropriate domes to fit my ears, and some practice in touch operating the control rocker switch, but all in all they are working wellI am hearing sounds I haven't heard in years.  On my morning walks I hear birds and even the crunch of  tree leaves and blossoms that have fallen on the sidewalk.  I hang small earbuds in my ear while walking and listen to my iPod as well.  Tv and telephone conversations are clear and understandable.  I even noticed that I now hear the hiss of water from the faucet when I wash my hands.  All of this is happening with the volume setting at its lowest level for both ears.Anyone with a hearing problem that can be successfully corrected with hearing aids, I recommend you give the EarCentric RIE400 a try."
164,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,These work!,"These work well.  Happy so far. I bought this particular model because of the water resistance claim as I sweat a lot.  My normal pair of hearing aids’ batteries fail if they even get a bit damp.  So far, so good."
164,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,failed after one year,"I have had these for about a year now, and they still work good. i just had an issue with a wax clog, and the seller responded in less than a day, telling me how to change the wax filter.These aids don't have a feedback cancellation circuit, or a compression circuit, and there is no way to adjust the sound frequencies. but since the in-the -ear sound element is far enough away from the microphone, it doesn't really need a feedback circuit unless you are using higher volumeThere is plenty of amplification. I use them on the lowest setting usually.I have had $5000 aids, and they sound better, but they are  about 35X more expensive. These will get you by just fine. And if you lose one, so what?UPDATE; one of them failed at about 13 mo. they offered a replacement for $45, or two new ones for $70, if I send the other one that still works back. Still pennies compared to what hearing aids used to cost."
164,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Very nice hearing aid but….,"Very light weight, works well and worth every pennies. I like the Receiver In Ear (RIE) design. I can shape the connecting tube to my ear shape. However, I have a little problem with the feedback. I am trying to figure how to minimize it."
164,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,How it fits and stays in my ear and noise cancellation,"It was hard to get it to stay in my ear at first, but as I used it I found that I could form the stem to fit more tightly around my ear and that helped a great deal!  I still have to be careful about leaving it in while I am working outside and bending over.  That is how I lost my $2000.00 plus hearing aid!  Over all I am very pleased with this one.  Thank you."
164,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,having a difficult time adjusting the ear bud,it helped my hearing  worked around loud equipment my whole working career
164,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Well worth the cost.,"I was pleasantly surprised when I received and tried the hearing aids. Considering the cost, I did not expect such a good product. I have worn hearing aids for many years, so I knew the style, etc, that I need. They perform almost as well as the $2000 aids I now have. I got the new aids for backup. Instructions are very good, so it took very little time to become comfortable with them. I would certainly recommend them."
164,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Over the ear problem,For the price I felt they were ok but I have long hair and wear glasses and the adjustment part behind the ear constant they got tangled in my hair.  I am going to look for bluetooth app enabled.
164,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Quality and function are great I'm very pleased with my purchase.,"I have tried 2 other companies with no luck, this hearing aid is great. comfort and quality are tops. Sound is very good, I would recommend this product to anyone. I've worn a high dollar hearing aid for years, but they just keep going up in price, this hearing aid gives me the same sound and quality."

164,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,EarCentric,"The hearing devices came in a timely manner. They are very well packed, and the instructions are great. We have just started the first charge, so unable to say anymore at this time. Appears to be good quality. Will update more after wearing."
164,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Quality especially for the price and easy to use,I find it easy to use. It seems to be a very helpful device for my hearing. I just wish it had a lower input volume level. Maybe I'm just not as hard of hearing as everyone says 🤣
164,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent!,"My prior aids were $8000 made by Starkey. I used these for about 8 years and had frequent problems. Each time they had to go to the factory for repair. This was 3 to 4 times a year at $250 minimum a trip.I just got these new ones and have found them to be vastly superior to my old ones in every area.Recently had a defect surface. I called customer service and spoke with a lovely young lady named Mary. I had a replacement within a week, no issues and no charges.The performance of these new aids is superior in every respect. I highly recommend them!"
164,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Friend Gift,It improved her hearing incredibly.
164,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,One of them works very well,I'm very happy with one of the hearing aids but the other one is giving me problems I'm going to be contacting customer service but if they both work like the first one I'd be thrilled

YES it does take getting used to, but just be"
164,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Ear piece,The hearing aides worked good but there’s ringing in my ears. The main problem was the ear pieces. All but one had ringing. The one that worked without ringing did not fit well. It hurt my ears to wear.
164,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Life changing,"I didn’t realize how much of life I had been missing until I purchased these hearing aids. I can hear so much more now, it’s been wonderful. As a bonus, my wife isn’t going to get rid of me now because I can actually hear her when she speaks! 🙂"
164,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Affordable product, quick delivery.","I have used hearing aids for the past year but unfortunately I lost them. Panic mode! I needed some quick and affordable. I looked on Amazon and came upon EarCentric. They arrived quickly and I have to say I am well impressed by them. Once I got used to the volume that I am comfortable with, I am loving them.I chatted with Ninia on the Help Line today about ordering domes and wax guards. She was very helpful and gave me the information I needed.It’s lovely to be able to hear again and join in conversations.Yvonne Wilson"
164,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very affordable, great sound and clarity, great customer support","Very good so far, I got these yesterday. Put them on, I like the fit. Very comfortable and small behind my ear. I was concerned about that as I wear glasses.I have low tone hearing lose, my husband’s tone of course. LolI have them at the lowest setting and hearing is good. My tinnitus is canceled which is amazing how they can do that.The clarity verses others I’ve tried to really good.I called customer support today for some questions, Ninia was very helpful and took care of me. Very good customer support.I didn’t want to go with the Dr expensive ($2000 - $8000) hearing aids. Glad I found a good alternative. Saved me a ton of money.Very happy customer."
164,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Best value product, excellent customer service","My dad was pleasantly surprised by how comfortable these aids are to wear and how well they work. He says these work way better than some more expensive ones he had used in the past, and there have also been instances when he forgot that he was wearing the aids and went to bed with them - that is how comfortable he feels wearing them! They are much lighter than his previous ones have been.Special mention for customer service - they are very courteous, and a breeze to work with. I say this after one of the aids stopped working, and after letting them know, they promptly replaced the unit. Needless to say, I'll be a returning customer as needed!"
164,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Aren’t comfortable,They have very short tubing which makes it difficult to place in the ear and keep on the ear.  The short tubing results in the body of the hearing aid riding on the top back of the ear instead of further down the back which makes it sit floppily on your ear instead of being held by your ear. They are also very difficult and uncomfortable to wear with glasses. They don’t offer longer tubing with this model and that is a fatal flaw in the design.  The sound quality appears to be very good.
164,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good for the price,It fits the ears not bad but hearing is good
163,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Real,"Just got my Apple Airpods and the are the real deal. Anyone on the fence try to figure out which airpods to get, I'd recommend the 3's.

163,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Authentic,Ordered these yesterday.  They arrived to my house by 8am this morning.  They sound way better than the Gen 2’s and are definitely 100% authentic.

They wouldn’t charge on wireless charger it had to be on the wire one and 2nd the charging light Would not turn on at the moment of charging so I never knew if it was charging or not, and on top of that I been waiting for my refund for the last 3 weeks because it keeps on pushing back the back deposit, it gave me one date and then never mind is gonna take 8 more days! So I called to Amazon today and the lady was super nice and was able to help!"
163,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,MAKE SURE YOU KNOW WHAT YOU WANT.,The AirPod 3 are not the AirPods Pro. It can be confusing. AirPod 3 have very little adjustments. They don’t fit in your ears very well. Spend $30 more and get a better set of AirPods. I’m saving you the return process. Amazons return process is the WORST I’ve ever seen. It can take 1 month or more to get your money returned. They act like you’re bothering them if you ask about your return.
163,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Haaaaaate these,"I wish I'd just gotten the 2nd gen again (and saved the $50).  These are bigger and don't fit your ear nearly as securely.  They feel (to me) like they're going to fall out all the time.  On top of that, they're also just a slipperier shape and I drop them all the time.  The sound is at parity with the 2nd gen; not better.  Save yourself the money and go for the cheaper once, which I would gladly get again and give five stars to."
163,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Airpods box was opened and product was used!,"Watch out! My airpod box was opened and the airpods inside were used and connected to an iCloud account. As soon as I tried to pair them, they had a name assigned already with emojis. I tried returning it, and turns out the return window is very short. So now I’m stuck with these airpods that I thought I bought new but wasn’t the case. Terrible experience!"
163,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,These fall out of my ears.,"I love the old ones that have a soft ear insert. These fall out of my ears and I just cannot use them. I wasted my money and unfortunately, my fault that I did not return them."
163,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,They’re ok,the audio quality is fine the mic could be better. they don’t stay in or fit my ears!!!!
163,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Won’t stay in my ears!,"Sound and mic are great, but they fall out every few minutes! I am very worried I will lose this expensive item when they just fall out. Please do better!"
163,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Air Pods,I thought these were noise reduction pros for a discounted price.
163,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Good sound quality, bad shape.","The fit was very different from the previous generations and would fall out of my ears frequently. The sound quality is great and comes with all the benefits previous generations but they are just unusable for me. Even if they did fit, the price to performance is definitely not worth it compared to the 2nd generation AirPods."
163,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,authentic!,came dirty but whatever 🤷‍♀️. they are real airpods!

Just got it today haven’t use it as yet. I will sure to give an update as soon as I use start to use it"
163,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,,"Son incómodos se salen rápido del oído, en lo personal los de 2da generación eran más ergonomicos, se adaptaban mejor y no se caían"
163,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Hard to keep it in my ear,The old airpods would fit in my ear great but these feel like they don't fit at all. I was told to twist them to make them fit better and it's better but it still doesn't fit well.
163,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,They are REAL,Was curious as to why one review said they were fake but still ended up ordering them. Received them today and they are the real thing. They work perfectly fine. No reason to be skeptical!
163,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Okay….,They sound awesome but fall out easily
163,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,It’s real 🙂‍↕️👍,I love my new airpods. The sound is absolutely amazing. At first the fit was super uncomfy but after 2 days i’m used to it! Charges so fast and it lasts so long. Quality is peak👌 And the overall performance is 10/10!
163,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very legit and real Airpods,"I have no complaints these came brand new and clean I paired them to my iPhone 15 Pro Max and had no issues, they fit my ear nice and the sound had nice bass and smooth crisp quality, I had a pair before and the charge does last a while, charging them is quick they don’t take long to charge, overall great performance in my opinion 👌👍"
163,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Hands free savior,Perfect in every way. They are comfortable in the ear and block outside noise. They last about 4-5 hours after fully charged. They are expensive but the quality is great.
163,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Don’t stay in!,"I was happy to recieve these. I had JBL and was frustrated with it constantly cutting out. Bought Apple thinking it might work better. Yes, sound was great but,,, the left one will not stay in my ear. Right is ok. Frustrated again!"
163,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best airpods out,I use this in heavy rain even know not reccomended occasionally they stop working but always dry out and work the next day. High quality
163,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,I’m an apple stockholder and these are Apple’s biggest flop.,"I purchased these the intention of using them with my iPhone 15 Pro. I have to say that I’ve never been able to keep the ear phones supplied with any of my Apple products in my ears. These AirPods proved to be an expensive mistake. The sound quality is not just superb. It’s fabulous, but that’s of no use when you can’t wear them in your ears they simply fall out immediately. I even purchased a little device that attaches to them in case they fall out of your ears or I should say when they fall out of your ears so that they don’t get lost in an airlines seat . Unfortunately, if I keep fussing with them, I can push them into my ears twist them in various directions and they may stay for 10 or 15 seconds. As much as I would like to keep them because the spatial sound feature is unbelievably great they are useless because they won’t allow me to keep them in my ! I mentioned earlier that I am an Apple stockholder. It’s a great concern to me that Apple makes products that sell. I don’t want my stock to lose value, but if they make ear phones that won’t stay in somebody’s head, then those sales are gonna plummet and if they plummet, they won’t make Apple any money and my stock will be worthless.i intend to write Tim Cook and complain about thesw. Yes, i know some folks can wear them, but EVERYONE should be able to. Now, to add insult to injury, I find I am not able to return them as my trip to Europe exceeded the return window."
163,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Too big but not the real problem,"I bought them and wore them for a day. They sound awesome but they didn't fit my ears. They kept falling out. I decided to send them back the next day to get the next generation. The only way to return them was through Amazon picking them up from my home through UPS. Then when they picked them up I didn't get my money back right away. I'm being told I won't get my money back for about 30 days. $182.00 that I won't be able to see for 30 days. That's if they send it at all. They were perfect when I sent them back, but I'm not sure I'll trust them until I get my money back."
163,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Runners Tunes,"These AirPods fit great. They actually stay in place while I do my daily run, compared to the first gens I had . So far comfortable  with great sounds.."
163,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,I love these,"My job got us all a pair of these as a team giveaway. I love these and the sound is really great. My only complaint is they don't have all the same shortcuts that could be done on the original pair. You can just do the very basics, you can't even turn up/down your volume. You can even long press them to activate Siri. Seems like a little bit of an oversight."
163,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Work great but maybe not 100%,ok so they dont fit fit in my ear but they dont fall out either. i got them because i wanted to cancel out my babys noise while i worked so ppl wont hear her. i think that part works BUT some one did say my voice is muffled. so im not sure. i cant give it 100% but i think they are not that bad also. I will keep em because they are OK
163,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,I like them but might’ve preferred the old version.,Not sure if they’re better quality than the old version and they’re definitely larger than the previous model. Was worth the price with like got on sale 30 off I got them for $144. Not unhappy but I think I prefer the original model. Sound quality is good I think they may have improved on that since the first release!
163,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Ear buds seem large for my ears,"I got these to replace my original AirPods 1st gen. The ear buds seem larger than the 1st gen ear buds, and I had a little trouble getting them to stay in my ears. If you have small ears, you are going to have a lot of trouble getting them to stay in. I haven't had a lot of time to test them out as they came with very little charge. They did pair easily and quickly with both my iPhone 15 and my iPad Air 11 inch (M2). The sound quality was good on the one song I listened to to test them out. Hopefully the battery life is longer than my 1st gen AirPods (which were only lasting about 20 minutes at the end)."
163,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Best ear buds so far for me,"I've tried several other ear buds, had problems with range, cutting out when phones in pocket,  sound quality. These have reassured me it was all the wrong purchases. I'm not an apple loyalist but very happy with my purchase."
163,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for workout,I use them to workout and I love them because they stay stuck in your ears. The audio quality is great and it seems like the sound is coming from outside and not in your ears. I love them so much!! Highly recommended
163,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Apple AirPods 3rd Generation,"The AirPods were sealed and packaged well. They came with everything they were supposed to, such as the Apple information, the AirPod itself, and the charger, which is lightning to type C."
163,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great quality,Purchased as a family birthday gift. No further explanation required.
163,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best AirPods,"I sold my AirPod pros so I can get another pair of these, these are 1 million times more comfortable, and you can optionally hear people with them in."
163,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,A must have,"I love my new AirPods. They were a big difference from my first-generation AirPods, so it took time to get used to them, but I loved them."
163,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Comfortability,"The sound is nice, along with the bass. However, it is easy to fall out of your ear, meaning you would have to push it in place every few minutes."
163,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Fit in the ear is not snug and no Noise Cancellation,The sound is awesome and connectivity is great. This is a Apple product no doubt about it... now the reason why I'm returning and going to the Airpod Pro 2nd gen... the naming is so crappy Apple product management needs to take note of it ASAP. You would think 3rd gen is better than 2nd gen but if you read the fine print its the other way around.1) These Airpods don't have a silicon tip and will not have a sung fit or provide a proper seal. Further I was always afraid these will fall out of my ear but they don't amazingly.2) Most importantly there is no Noice Cancellation I could find and I checked the web and also had a amazon tech support call on this. No point paying this amount and not getting ANC.Sorry Apple get your act together.
163,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent,It’s worth the price my great nephew loved it
163,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,They are great,Got them for my fiancé birthday and he loves em.
163,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,They won’t stay in my ears!,"I love my first gen AirPods, so I was excited to finally upgrade to these new 3rd gen. Sadly, Apple dropped the ball with these. I should’ve paid more attention to others saying the same thing, they simply won’t stay in my ears. I literally sit still watching a movie on the couch and continuously have to keep pushing them back into my ear every few minutes or if I turn my head they fall out. There is NO WAY I can walk around wearing them, which defeats the purpose of them! They sound great, but that doesn’t matter if I can’t wear them. I should’ve paid $50 more for the Pros, which is what I recommend to you."
163,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound,Easy to pair. Great sound quality. Very pleased.

163,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,It's perfect,"It arrived on time and it works perfectly fine, the AirPods were at 40% and the case at 79% when I got them."
163,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Work fine, fit awkwardly","I wish I would have gotten the same pair I had.  I decided to get the newer generation paid more for them and don't really like them.  They are a weird shape so they do not stay in my ears well, they fall out a lot.  When I walk or just doing stuff around the house I constantly have to put them back in my ear which is annoying because when you touch them then they mute.  Or when you are cleaning or doing yard work they fall out into the dirt, very irritating.  Wish I could send these back and get the older pair I had back"

163,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Real and great!,"There was a review that said these are fake, but after some people left reviews saying these Airpods are real, I decided I'd order these. Got them today, and they're a) genuine Apple product, and b) amazing! Connecting them to my iPhone couldn't have been easier, music and videos sound great, controls are easy to learn, and not being always tethered to my phone by wired headphones is great. If you've been considering buying Airpods 3 for any reason, I say go for it. Especially with the $30 discount over buying direct from Apple- icing on a very tasty cake :)"

163,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,AirPods,These are the real deal. Don’t listen to the”these are fake”comment
163,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Real deal,Not sure why the prior review claims that these are fake. They’re 100% real Apple AirPods.
163,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Apple AirPods,"Fit well in my ears, wireless.  Easy connection to my iPhone 14 Pro"
163,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,No bass at all,"Sound quality during music playback was well below what was advertised, with treble and mids boosted but bass almost non-existent. This was true for voice calls as well, necessitating a higher volume to compensate. I don't know how well they would work in a noisy environment because they went right back into the box to be returned.Setup and pairing were incredibly easy. They are very light and felt secure in the ear, but because of the added bulk over the Gen 2 they don't sit as deep. The skin detect feature caused playback to pause when I didn't want it to so I would have kept that turned off.Disappointed overall, but I'll give the Gen 2's a shot."
163,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,It was great for the first 3 minutes,"I was super excited to upgrade my Airpods from my 2nd generation to the 3rd. I spent hours debating and researching if I should get the 3rd generation or the Airpods Pro.  I ordered, received the next day, ripped openthe package and set up the spatial sound and WOW!!..it was amazing for about 3 minutes...and then the right airpod stopped working.At first I thought it was ""user error"" and had my brother try them out..He sadly informed me that the right side stopped working as he played them.Back to Amazon they go. Super bummed by this and now I'm debating if I should repurchase or go with the Airpods Pro..or maybe a different brand, altogether.Update: It's been about 12 days and I am Still waiting on a refund! I even offered to have my refund sent to an Amazon gift card instead of the original form of payment to help expedite the process and customer service cannot explain why that although they've received the airpods, they are holding on to my money."
163,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,Faulty,Hearing Music Is Good But Being Able To Call or Talk During A Phone The Audio Is Very Horrible The Other Person Can Barely Even Hear Me.
163,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,2nd Gen is Superior,"Every time you laugh, yawn, chew, or turn your head these things will do their best to eject themselves from your ears. If you are a runner, just forget it. I don’t leave reviews often, but this product was one of the greatest disappointments I’ve ever experienced. These things don’t even have sensors that allow you to tap to skip, pause, etc. You actually have to SQUEEZE the stem. All that time you spent trying to shove these things into your skull was wasted because you’ve pinched it right out of that fragile point of stability, and now you have to resist reaching for a mallet and attempting to hammer it far enough into your ear canal to where it’ll never fall out again. Going back to 2nd Gen. What a joke.Oh, the charging cable works. That was cool."
163,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not as good as Echo Buds,"I wanted to take a moment to share our experience with Airpods. We have had multiple pairs of Echo Buds, my wife lost a pair and wanted to try Airpods. We are returning them and purchased a new set of Echo Buds. Reasons why: 1) Sound Quality surprisingly even after doing the audio setup, was not as crisp or clear as the Echo Buds. 2) No matter what we did the airpods would not switch between PC and Iphone without some type of manual selection to re-connect. My Echo Buds will switch between PC and Iphone all day without an issue. If you are on the edge between airpods and echo buds I would highly recommend saving the money and buying the Echo Buds, you will be happier!!"

These AirPods are a perfect blend of sound quality, comfort, and cutting-edge technology. The Apple AirPods 3rd Generation offer a premium listening experience that is hard to beat. They are a fantastic investment for anyone looking for high-quality wireless earbuds. Highly recommended!"

163,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Uncomfortable but great sound quality not noise cancelling at all,Hurt my ears quite quickly and fall out easily. Sound quality is fantastic to the point where I had to check that the sound was not coming from my iPad. But not noise canceling in any way. Like somehow even worse than the wired version of the headphones. Definitely wasn’t worth the cost for me and wish I could return them
39,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Aids are always squealing in my ear no matter how they're placed. Don't hold charge more than 4 hrs.,Aids squeal in my ears no matter how I place them.  Charge does not last more than about 4 hours at best. I chose them because it was supposed to be RCA at it's finest but was NOT!  I tried all of the four volume channels in both ears but found that they still squealed whenever I moved.  They need to take the design back to the drawing board and make improvements!
39,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great hearing aids,"I bought these to try instead of going to an audiologist. I’m very impressed and hear sounds I haven’t heard in years.  They are very simple to use, work so well, and hold a charge for the entire day. Most important people can not see them. I’ve been very satisfied."
39,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Not as good as my old, more expensive hearing air.","Not nearing as the good as the hearing aids I was wearing.  I thought the rechargible aids would be better and smaller.  But these new aids just were not as good by a long way!  Cost about a sixth of what my older aids costs, but the difference in performance of the older aids was worth it.  I returned it for account credit.  I am back using my old battery powered hearing aids.Robert Morrow"
39,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,These are simply not very good.push button volume control does not work...DO NOT BUY,"THESE ARE QUITE SIMPLY NOT EASY TO USE,AND THE VOLUME CONTROL IS VERY HARD TO HEAR..DO NOT BUY"
39,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product,These are great.  Very easy to set up plus it came with a QR code to watch a 5 min video to help me set them up.
39,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Volume,Volume switches from soft voices to loud voices with out touching hearing aids
39,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Well worth the money,"I couldn't be happier with my purchase. I wanted to something to watch TV without having to have the volume blaring, but these are so much more. Just like when I started using readers its amazing what you are missing. I will say it did take some getting used to but after a couple of days I have found the perfect volume setting and now I've been keeping them in all day. If you are looking for an over the counter hearing aid I would absolutely recommend giving these a go."
39,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Junk,"I bought a pair of these directly from RCA & I am not happy to say the least. There's only 1 all-in-one button that turns the hearing aid on & off, supposedly allows you to switch between 4 pre-set functions and adjust the volume. Guess what? All it does is turn them on & off. I also suspect they sent me a pair that had been returned by someone because the return address on the package was for the return center. I am returning them. I don't recommend these to anyone. Save your money, don't buy them."
39,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product,This is a great solution to help someone hear that does not want the hassle of being fitted for hearing aids. I highly recommend trying these especially if you are on a limited budget.
39,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love the Product,"Five star rating for this product, it was as advertised, simple, efficient, and easy to use and I didn’t have to break the bank !!Highly recommend, and would buy again!!"

97,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Tinny Tones: A Not-So-Sound Investment,"The LINNER White Nova OTC Hearing Aids promised a world where the whispers of life wouldn't pass me by unnoticed. Unfortunately, the reality they offered was more akin to a high-pitched symphony of clangs and clashes. As someone who's been given the nudge to check my hearing, I approached these aids with the hope of clarity, not the cacophony they delivered.The design speaks of modernity and convenience, with Bluetooth connectivity and smart noise cancellation that should, in theory, fine-tune the world to your auditory liking. The volume adjustment boasted the kind of control one would look for in a personal sound system. Yet, when put to the test, the only thing they amplified was my disappointment.The sound quality was a letdown, with a tinny and harsh output that turned the subtle into the startling. My hearing, which sits comfortably at the 'expected' level for my age, was subjected to an assault rather than an assist. It seems that in their quest to boost sound, the manufacturers forgot that the quality of that sound is paramount.For those who need a gentle boost, perhaps the LINNER White Nova OTC Hearing Aids could still be of service. But for me, whose ears are still quite attuned, they did not hit the right note. They're a stark reminder that when it comes to hearing aids, there's a fine line between enhancement and overkill."
97,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,APP ADJUSTABLE HEARING AMPLIFIER,"These hearing amplifiers are convenient in a number of ways.  They turn on automatically when removed from the charging case and the volume can be adjusted with the two buttons on each unit. More convenient is to download the app and pair them with your phone. You can then see the volume settings of each unit but also the remaining charge, the bass and treble setting and choose one of 4 available modes: dialog, restaurant, commute and outdoor situations.  These 4 modes vary the noise reduction and hearing enhancement for the units.  Using the app you can also perform a hearing test on yourself which shows what frequencies are missing from your hearing profile.  Unfortunately, once you find out what frequencies are missing, these hearing amplifiers will not selectively boost them. Sounds get louder but missing frequencies are still low.  To enhance your TV watching a supplied wireless transmitter can be paired directly with these hearing amplifiers."
97,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Sound is clear and easy to use,"This hearing aid/amplifier set is exceptional. The device, along with a connecting unit for the TV, enables precise customization of DB levels for optimal performance. I've experimented with hearing aids that cost thousands, yet none match the quality of this one. The accompanying app allows me to fine-tune settings to meet my specific needs. Remarkably, the battery life lasts several days—I use it nearly 8 hours daily, charging it every other day since acquiring it. The standout feature is its frequency adjustability for both my TV and radio, making it a standout choice."
97,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,These Had An Opportunity Of Being A Step Above Their Nova-Lite But These Had Issues...,"The following is my cautionary note concerning the use of Hearing Amplifiers:Practically all of the Hearing Amplifier sellers on Amazon list somewhere in the description that they are selling Hearing Aids and in the very basic sense of the word they do aid in someone's hearing but they are definitely not true hearing aids. To me these should be listed as Hearing Amplifiers only and whatever hearing amplifiers you decide to purchase they are not true hearing aids but what most would consider as PSAP's (personal sound amplification products). These hearing amplifiers are sufficient for helping the elderly or hearing impaired with mild to somewhere below moderate hearing loss. True hearing aids amplify only certain frequencies based on your hearing profile or normally called an Audiogram where over the years you're lacking certain sounds due to one reason or another, but PSAPs amplify all sounds equally so if you use these aids to assist you with your hearing loss just be sure to start your volume level at the lowest level possible that offers a benefit to your hearing because if you crank them up too loud it may sound good at first but you may, over time, lose what good hearing you have left...Now to the heart of the issues of why I could only give these amplifiers 3 Stars for this review instead of 4 or 5. In the past while reviewing their Nova-Lite Hearing Amplifiers I came across their Linner App and it allowed a flawless setup of their amplifiers and their amplifiers worked very well after pairing with their app but in the case of these Linner White Nova amplifiers they worked great at first unitl I tried to pair them with their Linner Connect (their newest device) that came with these White Nova amplifiers that was intended to stream the sound directly from my TV. Every time I tried connecting to one of my TV's (which I tried on two of them) as well as my Laptop I could only get sound on my Right Earbud and not my Left one and when I finally unplugged the Connect box and turned it off I noticed that I could not get sound back to my Left amplifier until I did a complete Reset of my amplifiers by inserting them into their charging case and pressed the Reset button located on the charging case for approximately 10 seconds which reset both back to their original factory settings. There is no doubt that the technology for streaming the sound from my TV to my amplifiers can work like it's suppose to but I assume I just received defective one and knowing Linner if you had this issue I'm sure that they would be happy to provide you with a replacement but as a Vine Reviewer I'm not able to return a product and ask for a replacement but I'm supposed to review the initial product I'm provided with and provide it in a timely manner.Another issue that I wasn't expecting was a short stint of hourly usage between charges. With their Nova-Lite amplifiers I discovered that the higher that you set the sound volume the quicker the usage dissipates for that particular ear's amplifier. In my case my Right Ear is harder to hear from than my Left so if you follow the usage and battery level on their app you will see that your ear that requires a higher sound volume will go dead before the other one does, this type of hearing loss in one ear over the other can happen to military personnel or hunters (and possibly due to other working conditions) and they call it the Shooter's Ear from exposure to gunfire, a unique type of noise-induced hearing loss that affects one ear more than the other. With their Nova-Lite amplifiers I ended up with about 7.5 hours of usage before the Right Earbud battery died and I had to recharge them both. Well as it turned out I'm getting the same usage with these White Nova amplifiers as well which doesn't bode well for anyone expecting to get a full day of usage from these Linner White Nova amplifiers. Previously on their Nova-Lite amplifiers I gave them a 5 Star Rating but with the caveat concerning the short hourly usage for their amplifiers but in this case the issues that I had with these White Novas' forced me to lower their Overall Rating mainly due to their Linner Connect not working properly and it actually created an issue with my Left Ear amplifier not pairing back with the Linner App until I did a factory reset on my amplifiers. I have to admit that once I reset them and ignored the use of their TV Connect device these amplifiers worked just as well as the Nova-Lite amplifiers did for me that I had reviewed in the recent past."

97,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,"They worked great for me as music ear pods, but not so much for hearing aids.",I do really like the ear pods but they just didn’t do the job for hearing loss. It did amplify the sounds around me but the quality of the sound wasn’t what I needed. Did many adjustments downloaded the app and everything I could to get them setup for hearing aids but just did not care for them. What they did do very well was as ear pods for playing music. Did enjoy using them for music. I would say that they might be great for temporary use hearing aids in a place like a lecture hall or large meeting hall to to give you that added boost of volume and the sound quality didn’t really matter.
97,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Does not do a great job blocking out other noise,"I am not a big fan of these hearing aids. they are pretty bulky and not at all discrete, so they look more like wireless earbuds than like hearing aids. They function best when you connect it to your phone and download an app, so while that is a neat feature, it is not ideal to have hearing aids that are dependent on your phone and an app. The noise-canceling feature is pretty much non-existent, so while it amplifies voices, it also amplifies every noise. I found it to be so distracting, it was harder to hear and understand voices than it was without them. The sound quality coming from the phone through Bluetooth was fine, but nothing great. I did not enjoy wearing these, and I think there are many better options available."
97,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Some really unique features,"One feature this pair of OTC hearing amplifiers has is the built-in Uv-C Light. I don't necessarily understand the need for this but it will automatically turn on and sanitize your amplifiers whenever you put them back into the case.One feature that I really appreciate is the Linner connect system. It transmits sound directly to your amplifiers with pretty good quality sound. Speaking of sound, that is something that I am still playing with and getting used to. I'm not sure how to explain it properly but other OTC hearing aids as well as ear buds seem to provide sound as if my ears are hearing it, these seem a little more artificial. Like I said, I am still getting used to them and experimenting with the adjustments though."
97,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Makes everything amplified,Including the background noise. The sound of the background noise can be frustrating in loud areas where there are a lot of people or fans blowing overhead. But when it's said and done they needed boost of hearing is definitely there for the hearing impaired and this is a good middle of the ground Bluetooth headset.
97,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Well rounded set,"The media could not be loaded.
                



I'm still working on getting this set up for my parent to test.It seems like a quality set, starting with the packaging and instructions.The charging case with the UV cleaning cycle is a bonus!I really appreciate the physical volume buttons over another hearing aid's tiny adjustable screw.Bluetooth is great, easy to pair. I haven't tested the transmitter with a TV yet (might not happen soon).Not much noise cancellation. Probably best for those with light hearing loss.LINNER Nova Bluetooth Hearing Aids Rechargeable, In-Ear Hearing Aids, With Smart Noise Cancellation And Volume Control,Hearing Aids With Wireless Mic For Watching Tv For People With Hearing Loss (NOVA)"
97,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best OTC hearing Aids,"These hearing aids are incredible, the sound quality and clarity is perfect. The case has a UV light to kill any germs that may be on the hearing aids. The one nice thing about them is people won't know you're wearing hearing aids and you can actually stream your music to them from your phone. Yes the price for these OTC hearing aids is a little higher compared to others but in my opinion you're getting a better quality hearing aid. They are well built and you can charge them two ways, one by the USB cable and the other is a wireless charge. As I got older I got what people call fumble fingers and I can't grasp anything. Here's a little trick: get two pieces of dental floss about 8 inches long. When putting the hearing aids in the case just keep a loop of dental floss under the hearing aids so when you're ready to take them out you just have to lift the floss. They didn't come with a cleaning kit but you can get one here on Amazon or get a set of electric razor cleaning brushes also on Amazon. Another nice thing is you can also add a protection plan to them. I can't vouch for them using them as earbuds because of my hearing but they are great as a hearing aid and I highly recommend them."
97,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,really improved how well I can hear,"The fact that these hearing aids are rechargeable is fantastic; it saves me from the trouble of always switching out batteries. They fit in my ears comfortably and subtly, giving me a clear sound. The cool features like smart noise cancellation and volume control let me adjust how I hear in different places. Plus, having a wireless mic for watching TV is a great extra that makes these hearing aids useful for people like me with hearing loss. In general, they're a dependable and up-to-date solution that has really improved how well I can hear."
97,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Hearing Amplifiers / Earbuds I've Used,"These have the least amount of squeal and digitization effect of all the hearing amplifiers I have tested. As long as the volume is not set too high BEFORE you put them in your ear, there should not be any squeal when taking them out of the case or putting them on.The small case is easy to fit anywhere. Haven't yet found a pocket it doesn't fit in. The UV light for sterilizing in case is an interesting feature, and it's nice that you can wirelessly charge the case, and the case then keeps the earbuds charged. The app is very useful for fine tuning the volume levels and scene settings.As for sound amplification, while things do still sound just a little digitized, they are not muffled and everything is clear. And as Bluetooth earbuds for listening to videos or music from your phone, computer, tablet or a Bluetooth transmitter, they're excellent. The treble and bass is spot on. We're very happy with these."
97,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome hearing aid with a separate TV transmitter,"The hearing aid is great, with its smart features. My mother who is elderly and requires hearing aids  liked the sound quality. She did not complain about background noise, and was able to hear the sound from TV programs very clearly with the help of the sound transmitter that connects wirelessly with the hearing aid. Although the transmitter requires connectivity by cable to the TV, for which I had to tilt my large screen forward from the wall support to connect  the cable.The various sound modes allow its use outdoors, in noisy environment making it quite versatile. The charging time with its charging port is only 1.5 hours for a full charge. I charge these every night when she is not using them. The hearing aids turn on when I  take them out of the port. The smallest air buds or plugs fit her perfectly without dropping or becoming loose. The charger also has UV light that disinfects, which is a good feature."
97,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works very,"Probably one of the best hearing aids I've tried from Amazon. It's slightly on the expensive side, but considering how much they normally cost, it ain't much. The sound quality is really good as everything comes through clearly. It also comes with a TV adaptor thing which I haven't tried as I don't need it, it's still a really nice pair of hearing aids."
97,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Rechargeable Hearing Aids with UV-C Lamp,"These are high end Bluetooth hearing aids that are rechargeable. The hearing aids come with a charging case that is fast charging. It takes a couple of hours to charge and one charge will last 3-5 times of usage. This set can be operated by a smart app where the tone adjustment, volume adjustment and other settings can be operated. The earbuds themselves can also be operated on the earbuds by pressing the volume up or down buttons. The earbuds work well with good sound quality and help hearing much better."
97,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are a set we would buy again.,"We got these for my husband to use.They arrive in a box, needing to be charged to full and paired to a deviceThey seem to be made well.The buds themselves feel sturdy.The case seems durable.The connect box seems strong.The app is easy to find, download, and use.The connect box was also easy to use.He was able to hear the television with it successfully without us having to have it too loud for everyone else.The sound quality is good.We would buy these again."
97,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Not perfect but a good back up,"These hearing aides are a good alternative if you can't afford more expensive, higher quality ones.  I got them because my mom seems to misplace her good hearing aides often and having these as a backup pair she can use for short periods of time is a life saver . . . like playing bingo at her facility!  Because of all the adjustments for sound and such she cannot use them on her own.  Too complicated for an elderly person.  These fit in her ears well and the best part is no one can see them . . . which is very important to her. They certainly don't take the place of her high end hearing aides but they definitely allow her to go about her day without having to ask people to repeat themselves over and over."
97,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great quality and features for the price,"Rating the virtually identical “White” and “Lite” models, both of which I received for review.With deregulation of hearing aid sales, there is a big benefit to consumers who can now buy a wide range of hearing aids they previously never had access to.At a price of $249 at the time of this review, I believe the LINNER product represents an extraordinary value.Lay me start off by saying that I am not hearing impaired but if I were I would definitely consider these as a first step.Out of the box the first impression is that it is like hearing with a high powered microscope for the ears.These does seem to be an infinitesimal delay but not enough to hardly notice.  You can hear yourself sigh and I imagine you might pick up things you’ve never been able to hear before.That being said, the quality as pure hearing aids to use for conversation or say listening to the TV leaves a little something to be desired. The sound when listening to the TV through the microphones is not as deep or rich but the volume is definitely improved.Now if you connect the wireless module to the headphone jack on the TV, it streams the TV audio to your heading aids via Bluetooth flawlessly with a deep rich highly satisfying sound, including noise cancellation. There is no discernible delay between video and audio which makes these really pleasant.TV use alone makes this a great device. It also allows you to listen privately.  I’m not sure if it would support two sets of hearing aids but that would sure be nice to allow private listening and adapting to different levels of hearing needs.The same goes for phone Bluetooth - flawless - and music sounded GREAT.There is also a mike mode on the wireless transmitter but I have but I have not tried that for conversation or listening to the TV and it’s not really addressed much in the manual other than mentioning it’s existence.The hearing aids look a lot like the familiar OEM brand that come with your phone so it’s pretty cool to be able to wear hearing aids that look like high end ear buds.The case, wireless module, packaging and accessories are world class level.  And incredibly the charging case incorporates individual UV sanitizing lamps for each hearing aid!The hearing aids are incredibly comfortable and fit me perfectly out of the box.  If not, there are a variety of sizes of ear tips provided. Also includes is a charging cord, cord to connect the wireless module to your TV’s headphone jack and behind ear clips.The app is also wonderful but it took me a few tries to connect.  Only through the app can you control the four sound modes for your hearing aid environment.  This is only necessary when using these as pure heading aids.The app also includes a pretty good hearing test for initial evaluation.  It doesn’t replace an audiologist’s test but it’s a decent at home version for your personal initial screening.I’m really impressed by this product from LINNER and all they packed into this high quality, highly functional and wonderfully styled product.Minor recommendations for improvement.  The pad on the bottom of the wireless module slipped off center but was easy to fix.  The instructions didn’t seem to address charging the wireless module - at least not that I could find.I recommend giving these hearing aids a try."
97,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Must use app for full functionality; some unique features,"As a computer science professional, I am very cautious regarding privacy, and it is a real disappointment that the full functionality of these hearing aids / amplifiers is not available without using their app. The major functionality that is not available without using the app is being able to use (switch between) the 4 different hearing modes; if there is a way to use them without the app, I could not find out how in the instruction manual. In the default mode these aids are very sensitive, even at the lowest volume however (like most aids I have tested and used), I can hear my own voice and other unwanted sounds (like my own footsteps, etc.). Note that friends with the very expensive aids have told me, they experienced the same unwanted sounds initially but got used to them and no longer notice these unwanted sounds. An unusual inclusion is the LINNER Connect wireless remote. It pairs by Bluetooth and you can place it anywhere within Bluetooth range to hear sounds emanating from the remote rather than the aids. I tried this and noticed a lag time between the sound origin and hearing it from the aids. I could not use it to connect it to my TV which would have been a very desirable feature. An unexplained feature was the included ear hooks; they somehow can connect to the aids and go around the back of the ear but I could not get them in place. These aids do fit nicely and are hidden in plain view as they look like ear pods; they can also be used to listen to music and take phone calls (once they are paired with your phone); I thought the music sounded very good with a good range of sounds but I am not an audiophile. It is also nice that the ear pads are sterilized fairly well each time you put them back in to their case. These aids also come with a USB C power cable, a cable to connect the wireless remote to a TV (if the TV has the needed port), and extra ear pads (tips). These seem to be quality hearing aids / amplifiers but they are not for me given the apparent requirement to use Linner’s app to use their full functionality and features, as well as the inability to connect to my TV. These are not for me and I consider them between 2 and 3 stars; others that are fine using the Linner app and can connect to their TV might rate them much higher."
97,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,A Technological Leap in Hearing Enhancement,"The Bluetooth Rechargeable In-Ear Hearing Aids are a groundbreaking solution for those with hearing loss, blending cutting-edge technology with user-friendly features. My experience with these hearing aids has been nothing short of transformative.Firstly, the smart noise cancellation is a standout feature. It filters out background noise effectively, allowing for clearer conversations and a more immersive listening experience. Whether I'm in a bustling café or walking on a windy day, these hearing aids ensure that important sounds are never lost in the noise.The Bluetooth connectivity is seamless and a game-changer. I can connect the hearing aids to my smartphone, enabling me to take calls or listen to music directly through them. The wireless mic for watching TV is an added bonus. It enhances the TV audio without increasing the volume for others in the room, making it a perfect companion for movie nights.The in-ear design is discreet and comfortable, fitting snugly without any discomfort during extended use. The volume control is intuitive, allowing for easy adjustments to suit different environments.The rechargeable feature is both eco-friendly and convenient. Gone are the days of constantly buying and changing tiny batteries. A single charge lasts me through the day, and the charging process is straightforward.If there's a slight drawback, it's the initial setup, which might require a bit of patience to get used to the controls and Bluetooth pairing. But once configured, the ease of use is remarkable."
97,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Product worked great for 1 day and left earbud stopped working,Worked for 1day then left earbud stopped working. I returned for a replacement and it did the same thing. I returned for a refund and now am being told that my refund will take 15 days to be credited back to my card.
97,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Low white noise,"I like Linner hearing aids. This is the third pair I've tried and the experience has been consistent. Their model naming is a bit inconsistent across Amazon listings and their own website but their earbuds have been better than over a dozen other cheaper OTC earbuds I've tried.Sound wise the thing that Linner stood out most on was how minimal the acoustic feedback was; specifically with white noise. Its still there but its not being amplified at the same levels and thus it was a much more comfortable experience. Sound quality has that typically stale reproduction hearings aids do. Limited range but its free of static. I cant tell when/if the noise suppression is engaged. Sometimes it sounds like the start/end of sounds are fading in and out real fast. No idea if this is the sound suppression at work. Its not all that common either.Out of the box the hearing aids work fine and you can control the volume from buttons on each bud. To do any other configuring you have to use the app. I tried it out to use the different listening modes and didn't really find that this was an important feature for me. The UV-C case is one of those things where the principle is sound but I have no ability to prove or disprove disinfection.Something to consider with the wireless audio transmitter is how your TV handles aux audio output switching. Some do it automatically and some require going into settings, but many will not provide audio to the internal speakers while the aux output is engaged. I also tired to connect these directly with my Apple TV, not using the wireless module, but even though it was detected there was a compatibility issue that prevented pairing."
97,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,I love that it comes with an app to help manage settings and battery,"Overall we really like this hearing aid set. It was a little difficult gettting everything setup and learning the app but they look similar to headphones and they are doing well in assisting with hearing. Where it’s been hard for me to hear prior, these have really turned up the volume.. so much so my mom wants a pair now after I let her try them"
97,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Really makes a difference,"Here at home, it has been brought to my attention many times that my hearing is not quite what it used to be, particularly with regard to the volume on the television set. It was because of this that I was motivated to try out these hearing aids. I see these as something that I will likely only use around the house…they are very similar in shape and form as many popular Bluetooth listening devices. Very conveniently, they charge in a wireless case that can fit in my pocket. I personally have just a little bit of trouble extracting them from this charging case as the very top of the pieces are a little bit slippery and hard to grab and pull out with my fingers.  But nevertheless, with just a little extra effort, I am able to do it fairly quickly.  It is nice and simple to get started using these - after charging them up, it’s pretty much just plug (in) and play.  While the experience is still new for me, there’s no question that these really make it easier to hear in much greater detail and clarity what is going on around me.  Also, I really like that it is very simple and easy to adjust the volume on the fly, as my fingers can easily, using touch alone, differentiate between volume up and volume down on each respective piece.  All in all, I think there are times when these can certainly improve my quality of life."
97,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Amplifier,This product allows me to watch TV without having other family members leave the room because it was too loud for them.  Now we call all sit together and enjoy watching and talking with each other.  Makes life a little easier for everyone.I am not a techie so I ended up not using the app.  My hearing loss is moderate and this device is just what I needed.
97,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent, sound is a bit tinny","This is my first pair of hearing aids, and when opening the box, I was daunted. There was a transmitter and instructions for an app, and a power button the hearing aid case. I thought, ""Oh boy, what have I gotten myself into?"" But, it turns out that you don't need any of the fancy features. You can just open the hearing aid case, and they turn on automatically. Just stick them in your ears, and the amplification is instant! They were so loud, and I scared myself when I said something, but watching TV was like watching with headphones on, and I could hear everything and everyone. Noise cancelling was excellent. I only heard what I wanted to.I wasn't sure how to turn them off, and the instructions were minimal, but I found out that you just put them back in the case and close it, and that turns them back off. The sound is a bit tinny, so I deducted a star for that, but otherwise, I am beyond please with these, and they are such a great value, too! The fact that they're rechargeable means that I will never have to worry about buying those tiny batteries either."

108,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good Company; Good Equipment,"YOUR MESSAGE TO US I waited a while before submitting this comment so I would have had experience in changing the battery and cleaning the earpiece of wax.Now I can say without reservation that this amplifier meets all my needs.I am very impressed with the company: they phoned me the day after I received the unit (I received it 2 days earlier than I had expected), and they asked me if I had any questions or if there was anything they could help me with. I said “No, all is fine”.I had watched the videos that Otofonix has on its website and they had answered all my questions.I had expected trouble cleaning the equipment because I am legally blind – but not blind; and with my magnifying devices, I got the battery changed and the equipment wax-free, with only minor slow-downs.I had tried a regular hearing aid and it did not take me long to figure out that an audiologist’s business plan includes not only the healthy mark-up for equipment, but also continuing revenue from follow-up visits for adjustments, wax cleaning, etc. The audiologist's equipment soon stopped working and I soon quit the audiologist.So, I am happy indeed with my Otofonix amplifier! It is working just fine!"
108,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,good-,"these are easy to use and work well.  Noise cancelling could be a little better and volume could be increased- at least for me-.  i've tried 6 of amazon's hearing aids and these are very good, among the best and i think a great value for money."
108,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,Didn’t help,"I have moderate hearing loss in one ear. My ENT suggested I try Otofonix Elite as a first step. I found it hard to know which volume level I was at and which program I was on. There is a lot of clicking on the rocker bar and beeping to sort through. However, for me, the bottom line is that it didn’t help me hear better. I got 100% refund so it was worth the try."
108,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,One of the best purchases I've ever made!,"Having started to have problems understanding conversation, I had been considering a hearing aid for a while but was put off by the price. The great reviews on this hearing amplifier, the price compared with a hearing aid, and the ability to try then return if it didn't work for me convinced me to try the Otofonix. The last bit of information that swayed me was the ability to buy tubes for either ear for the same unit, which I did. I ended up using the opposite ear from the one I thought I would prefer. I have been amazed! No break-in period required at all. I've been wearing mine all day every day since I received it, absolutely no discomfort, program 2, level three or four. I let my husband try mine since his in-ear hearing aid was no longer working and he was sold, too, so I ordered one for him as well. His hearing is worse than mine and it's great to be able to have conversations again without repeating several times or using texting. :) Customer service is amazing. too! Quick answers, even on weekends. I've had mine a couple weeks and have purchased the protection plan now as well.  It's a keeper!"
108,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Love it!,"I purchased my Otofonix Elite PSA back in February of this year, and I love it! The only advice I would give is not to be afraid to take it apart and clean it. I waited six months to download the video on how to clean this device because I was afraid I might break it or something. The video was very simple to understand - they slowly take it one step at a time.  I'm going to now try the closed dome and see how it works out for me. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I had to get a magnifying glass to better see how to put it back together. I'm 65 yrs old & I like this better than expensive hearing aides that costs thousands of dollars"
108,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Unsatisfactory performance at this price point,Bought the pair for my 82 year old mother who’s hearing is less than perfect. She spends a lot of time in a room with the tv on in the background. She found the device to be comfortable after a couple days of wearing it. We tried various modes and volume settings combinations  but what one adjustment seemed to correct didn’t really correct the other one simultaneously to the point of satisfaction for the price point. We weren’t able to find the optimal combination for eliminating background noise while at the same time being able to hear personal conversations in the same room or adjoining room with total satisfaction like she remembers from the days when she could hear normally.
108,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Replacement,This was a replacement for a one that died.  Very pleased so far
108,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,The improvement in clarity of hearing is amazing. Even at the lowest setting,"The improvement in clarity of hearing is amazing. Even at the lowest setting, I no longer miss parts of words spoken in normal conversation. As an insomniac, I'm happy that I can lower the volume on the TV. I'm not noticing any chance in my ability to hear distant sounds.I haven't noticed much improvement in hearing music: I hear a wider range of low notes, not so much improvement in the high range.On the down side, I can't wear the devices at work: Anything that brushes against or near my ears dislodges the device. (I'm trying to wear headbands to keep them in place.) Also, getting acclimated proceeds slowly: More than a few hours use gives me a headache. So does increasing the volume.)All in all, overjoyed I got them!"
108,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good product - but read the manual and watch the videos!!,"Bought these for my Dad who is turning 92.  When he doesn't wear them, he puts his TV on volume level 45 which practically shakes the house.  With them on, the TV is on level 20.He's 91 and didn't tell me when they weren't working properly or having feedback .  So a few things you must do:- open the battery case each night when they are removed- replace the batteries weekly, and most importantly -- CLEAN them weekly.Their website was really good with how/to videos for this and now they are working great.  I give them four stars overall for the product and like I said, their website is terrific."
108,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Hello, World. Where have you been?","I've only worn this for a couple of days, but I am amazed. I don't have severe hearing loss, and have never worn a hearing aid, but I only have one eardrum. I find it really hard to understand what people are saying when they are speaking in subdued tones or when there is a lot of background noise. I nod my head and smile a lot without a clue what people are talking about. The directions said that it might take as long as 3 weeks for the brain to get used to this device. For me, it took all of 3 minutes. I could hear sounds clearly that I hadn't noticed in years -- paper crinkling, the chorus of house noises, the night creatures shrieking. I suppose some people might find all that distracting, but I found it invigorating, and it did not interfere with my ability to hear the TV or engage in conversation. I discovered I have to be careful not to put my hand too close to my ear when pushing my hair back as it will shriek. I haven't had it long enough to say more, but my first impression is WOW!"
108,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Satisfied customer and then some,"Like many reviewing this product, I have been wearing hearing aids for 10 years. The most recent were $5K each. They did help.I ordered the Otofonix as a back up because I needed to send one of mine in for service and repair with an estimate of 3 weeks to have it returned.I loved the Otofonix, have received my old one back and it is now the back up. I ordered a new Otofonix for my other ear. The biggest difference is I am in control of the adjustments. I went to the movie theater Saturday to see King Arthur, adjusted my device as I sat down, heard every word and enjoyed the movie. This prompted my purchase. Otofonix customer service is outstanding. Far surpassed my expectations for a minor pricing issue. 45 day free return if unsatisfied, give it a try. i am sure it is not for everyone, for me it is."
108,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great hearing aid for the price,"i was told that i would eventually need a hearing aid due to loss in both my ears from ringing in my ears and issues from when i was younger, the doctor did advise try to hold out as long as possible since its not the same as your natural hearing. I work as a kitchen manager at a high school and its sometimes noisy and hard to hear the kids. So i bought this as a less expensive solution to full blown hearing aids. I have been very very happy with this aid. I just bought it for one ear to see how it works. And i compaired it to my moms expensive hearing aids. They look exactly the same. If my hearing gets worse i will eventually buy one for the other ear but for now this is perfect"
108,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Satisfactory,The hearing aid itself is more than satisfactory for me. I have moderate hearing loss. What was a bit annoying was the fact that it came with a short tube that would fit only a child; the open style dome did not give me enough amplification. There was an extra tube that was longer and also a closed type dome that worked for me. I then had to order the longer tubes from Otofonix at a rather high price. I bought more domes from another vendor.
108,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Increased sound volume-unsure about spoken speach,"I ordered two hearing aids, a left and a right ear. One is still working. The other one quit in less than a week.  I will try to return it. This may be a good strategy.I definitely notice increased sound volume and notice no screeching, but I am not sure that it actually increases my hearing or understanding of the spoken voice, which is the main reason that I need the hearing aid."
108,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,Very unhappy,"I had one for several years and the volume control fell off. I ordered a new one thinking that I had gotten a good value out of the first one. The new one only lasted two weeks and it’s volume control fell off. Both were purchased through Amazon. I don’t know if they are responsible, but they should know what they are selling."
108,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great customer service,"I would give 10 stars for customer service. What a great service! For product: I bought it for my aging mother. The machine works ok for amplification may be because her hearing loss is too severe and not the machine's fault. However, I thing the length from ear peace to the machine is too short and is not adjustable so the machine would not fit properly on ear. Also, like any other machine it goes through batteries fast and it would be rather difficult for old person to change batteries."
108,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent amplifier,"I've tried other amplifiers with varying success.  Even had a pair that was tuned to my hearing loss (mild to medium).  They were just OK.  I tried the Elite's from Otofonix and right out of the box they were exceptional.  Sound is smooth, volume adjustable.  I just  keep them on ""normal"" setting and they're great.  I highly recommend."
108,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,WELL-SATISFIED WITH THIS PRODUCT,"My husband has enjoyed these amplifiers for almost two years. They are the first he has ever owned so he has nothing to compare. This is a replacement for one he dropped on concrete and broke.Since wearing masks, he lost one when removing the mask but two months later, found it and it still worked.He dropped the other one on concrete, again when removing his face mask. It would not work after being dropped. We had purchased the extended warranty but it does not cover dropping.Since the first purchase, the price had come down $100/each.He is well-satisfied with these amplifiers, especially for the price."
108,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Don't Be Fooled By Low Price: These Were Terrific for Me!,"What I like most was the price!  What I like most in terms of use, was how much more comfortablethese hearing aids (sound amplifiers) were when holding a telephone to my ear.  With the 'expensive'doctors' office hearing aids, my ears hurt.  Also, Otofonoix were easier for me to put on, even withouta mirror.I can barely feel them, and they certainly are not visible either.I'm 84, and not very good mechanically, so I asked my 16 year old Granddaughter to assemble them for me,and explain the features.  It took her 10 minutes to read the manual and assemble, and she did a terrific jobof explaining the features to me.  Delivered on time, with excellent instructions, even though I neededhelp to put them together."
108,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very good hearing aid :),My husband has Ménière's disease which has caused him to lose about 50%+ hearing in his right ear. We were planning on getting an expensive hearing aid or seeing what we could get through our insurance. After reading reviews for several different expensive hearing aids we were surprised to learn that SO many people didn't find them any better than inexpensive ones. So we decided to try the Otofonix Elite but weren't really expecting too much. I'm happy to report that this hearing aid has helped my husband a lot! He can hear really well with it on. He has to adjust it for different situations but says it's easy to do. Definitely recommend.
108,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,It works,"If you're looking for your original hearing, you're not going to find it.  Mine went out with the gun blasts, but these help.  I  have to keep it turned up pretty loud and that leads to some squelching, high pitched noise, but I can deal with it.  I have learned to use the different environment settings and this helps between talking, movie watching and such.  Batteries are cheap.  Have to keep your ears clean, a little wax in the end stops them from working until you clean the tip."
108,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Still Adjusting,Seems to work okay but not what I expected.  I thought conversations would be more easily to hear; however some voices are very hard to understand unless I'm looking right at the person.  I also found it hard to adjust for TV listening.  At one time I had one of the expensive hearing aids that was very clear without background noise but guess I'll get use to the Otofonix.  The price is so much better than the expensive ones but the quality isn't there yet.  Hopefully hearing aids that are purchased from sources other than audiologists will improve.
108,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,good deal,"I had my hearing tested a few weeks ago and I have a flat line hearing loss. An amplifier works fine for this type of loss so I got it. So far I have worn it about three times and I am happy with it. It becomes a little sore in the ear after about 4 or 5 hours but that will improve over time. I have had very expensive hearing aides in the past ($3,000) each. I like this device better and you can't beat the price. I will be glad to have it when I go to the movies. This is a really good deal."
108,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Highly Recommended,"My husband just received this. It worked right out of the box. They call these sound amplifiers. Not sure of the difference between hearing aids and sound amplifiers. This is for my husband. We bought the $1,600 pair of hearing aids. He always complained of not being able to hear in public settings. He lost one working outside in the yard. We purchased the Otofonix. He said he is happy with it. The company called the first day to make sure we were happy with the product. Great customer service. Better customer service with the Otofonix than we had with the $1600. pair of hearing aids. Just based on customer service I would recommend this product, but my husband likes the product so I am recommending it also based on this issue as well. It has several volume levels. They have a website with videos for instruction and they have phone numbers for help. The nice part for us is that it uses the same battery's his other hearing uses."
108,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Very good quality.,"I have used this device for a few months now and I became comfortable with it very quickly. It fits well, you tend to forget about it so don't jump in the shower with it in. I did it a couple of times and got lucky using a hair dryer on cool to dry it. Controls are easy to master and use. Read up on these on the web site. They recommend getting a device for your better hearing ear first if you start with one like I did. I use it in my weaker ear and it still helps a lot."
108,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Otofonix Personal Sound Amplifier,"Bought this device in late August 2017 and really liked it.  It's very affordable, sleek looking, very comfortable to wear, easy to set up and worked flawlessly as stated.  I tried it for 10 days but had to return because the sound amplification was not loud enough for people with severe hearing lost like me, unfortunately.  I highly recommend this product for those with mild hearing lost.  I am sure it would work beautifully and you would save a bundle too, but keep in mind that this device is not designed for those with heavy hearing lost!Otofonix company was awesome.  Its customer service was second to none:  the shipping took only two days, customer calls were answered within minutes (spoken by a real English speaker which is very helpful for a hard hearing person like me), return was a breeze and refund was prompt. Otofonix deserves my 5 star rating, so does Amazon."
108,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome product and great customer service!,"My husband has been needing a hearing aid for awhile, but we kept putting it off because of all the complaints we heard from our friends wearing expensive hearing aids.  Usually in the $4000 range.  We were quite discouraged and didn't want to waste money on something that wasn't going to do the job.After doing some online research and product shopping we came across this hearing aid.  The reviews were so good we decided to take a chance and try it and we are so glad we did.  My husband (after reading directions on their website first) popped it on and was thrilled!  I don't have to repeat everything I say to him anymore, which is awesome! It is so small that I don't even notice when he is wearing it.  Customer service is outstanding.  We will keep evaluating as time goes by to see how durable it is.  So far, we are very happy!"
108,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good as auxiliary for deaf ear,"Not good for extreme hearing loss. but works well as auxiliary amplifier for second ear with a hearing aid in good ear.Good for moderate hearing loss as it is only an amplifier and not a hearing aid, My wife who has some hearing loss did not find any difference between wearing it and no amplifier in her ear, She also had difficulty setting it up. I tried it in my bad ear with a hearing aid in my good air and it helped a great deal especially in rooms with bad acoustics and lots of noise,"
108,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,It’s not what I expected!,"I purchased because the price was real good and was hoping for the best in a hearing aid that would help fairly nicely. With tv and radio as well as conversation, It produces just a little better sound at around 1/3rd the volume but when pressing past that it tweets like hell along with head movement.So I have to keep volume low which does not help."
108,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,My Limited Product Comparison,"So far... after 3 days I'm very pleased.  First, when the package arrives, you feel like you are opening an Apple product - very high-end packaging and presentation.  Second, I paid approximately 7x this price at Costco about 2-3 years ago and ended up returning that pair and giving up on my moderate hearing loss.  Frankly, I don't believe the Costco hearing aid had much, if anything, over this Otofonix product; not for me anyhow.  Third, this is, in fact, very discreet and at least as discreet as the Costco product I tried.  Finally, this has been easy to learn and use.  To be fair, the $2,500 I paid at Costco was for a pair and the Otofonix is for just one, but in trying both products I would say the Otofonix is a superior value.  Update... now 45 days out and this is still a winner."
108,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Saying ""Huh?"" and ""What?"" MUCH less often!","Wow! Very impressed with this unit, especially for the price. I have just one bad ear (right) so bought only a single unit and am adjusting quickly. I'm hearing dialogue on the TV that I've been missing for years. ""Huh?"", ""What?"", and ""You need to SPEAK UP!"" are rapidly disappearing from my conversations--to my own and my friends' and family's relief!So far the four program settings and ten volume settings have covered every situation I've been in. I ended up using the ""closed dome"" earpiece because I was getting too much whistling feedback at the higher volume levels I needed and the closed dome focuses the sound better.I do not notice the unit physically when I'm wearing it, except for some initial slight soreness in my ear canal as I adjusted to the presence of the earpiece. I thought I would be more self-conscious about having a behind-the-ear device as opposed to one small enough to fit completely in the ear, but the clear tubing is practically invisible and my ear and hair otherwise are protecting my vanity.Battery life so far has been fine. Haven't had to clean it yet, but the kit it comes with has everything you need. Now I just have to settle in and see how durable it turns out to be! The quality of the construction appears first-rate to me, so I'm hopeful it will last a good long while."
108,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Easy to use and improved hearing at a reasonable cost,"This is my first attempt at a hearing device.  Although I could afford a hearing aide at any cost I decided to try the inexpensive Elite Otofonix to see if I could tolerate a hearing device and if it would help.  I had no trouble whatsoever adapting to the Elite.  I have had it a week and wore it most pm hours during the day. I don't wear it walking on the beach or to the gym as I did read humidity or dampness can be a problem.  I have wore it to a dance, basketball game and play.  I was amazed how good I could hear and I adapted quickly to the background noise of the various activities.  I haven't tried all the settings but Setting 1 and 2 both work well.  It is easy to adjust, it doesn't whistle.  My girlfriends didn't even know I had it on as it is nearly invisible in my ear.  I hear much better and plan to continue to wear the Elite most awake hours when not at the beach or gym.  I will share I am fairly flexible and normally can go with the flow.  I expected the Elite to work and it did. Currently I have no plans to attempt a more expensive hearing device as the Elite appears to be working fine."
108,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,High quality at quite a savings.,"I have worn $2000 hearing aids for about five years now. I have moderate hearing loss from wearing headphones for my job in radio.  I have a loss of high frequencies making it difficult to understand conversations, especially in noisy environments.  My hearing aids are equalized to compensate for the frequency loss.Recently my right hearing aid stopped working so I looked into replacing the single unit with a hearing amplifier, after seeing how the prices of hearing aids have increased since I bought mine.  The 45 day money back guarantee and the good reviews for Otofonix convinced me to give them a try.  I am very pleased with the Otofonix Elite and impressed with the four different programs and the 12 band audio processing.  The normal setting is satisfactory for most situations, but last week I was driving in pouring rain, and the rain noise on the roof of the car was disturbing.  I switched to the Noisy setting which reduced the rain noise to a very comfortable level.  The well written documentation clearly explains  the difference between hearing ""aids"" and hearing ""amplifiers"" and I think I made a wise choice purchasing the Otofonix.  This unit is constructed every bit as high quality as my expensive hearing aid and works just as good for me."
108,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very easy to use,"I received my Otofonix Hearing Amplifier 5 days ago and it has already changed my life. This is my first experience with a PSAP, I have mild hearing loss, a spectrum of lower tones is completely lost to me. I could not engage in conversations at work because people tend to whisper and I could not hear half of what was being said.  I have had my Otofonix for 2 days at work and it has helped tremendously. There is one caveat, the Otofonix tends to crackle near electronic equipment, there are areas at work I have to reduce the volume to the lowest setting while walking there. I wish there was a simple off switch that I could hit when moving about in the building, the interference can be very startling. Very easy to use, great online videos to reference. I was able to easily change the sound tube and ear dome to fit my size. If you order through Amazon, the company sends you an email within 24 to 48 hours introducing themselves to you and provides links to manuals and videos that show you how to set up first time use. By the time you receive the product you already know what to expect and how to begin using it. Moreover, the reference materials include cleaning and trouble shooting. If you are not happy, they want to know and provide contact information."
108,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,I thought the product was well made and felt like it would have held up for a long time,It didn't work for me. I have moderate hearing loss in my left ear. To cut it up to the volume I would need for conversation I would get interference. It amplifies noises so if there is a lot of background noise it is still hard to understand the person that is talking to you. If you want this for watching TV or listening to music it works well but not with conversation. The tube stuck out too far to make it useable with the phone. I even bought a smaller tube for it online. When I stuck it inside my ear it would hurt my ear drum if I pushed it in to the point where I could the phone. I thought the product was well made and felt like it would have held up for a long time. It just didn't work for my situation. I am getting hearing aids from my hearing doctor. Hopefully they will work better so I can stop asking people to repeat themselves. :)
108,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,another satisfied customer. I had to laugh when I was ...,"Well, here I am, another satisfied customer. I had to laugh when I was reading other reviews because I now realize that I am a stereotype user. I've known for years my hearing was bad because I had it tested. About ten years ago, I was informed that I had a 40% loss in both ears. Well, I figured everybody could just speak louder and I would be OK. I couldn't justify over a $1000 per hearing aid that the clinic was trying to sell me. My wife has a ""little girl"" type of speaking voice and even people with decent hearing sometimes have trouble understanding her. For years I have been telling her to write down what she says as opposed to what I hear and write a book about it. The last one was:(Me) How much do you want me to get? ( wife) ""I asked if you had taken out the trash.Well, I ordered one unit figuring that I had nothing to lose because of the money bak promise. After using the Elite for a week I can't begin to express how much I am enjoying it. Especially in the car listening to my music and at the movies. The number 4 setting is fantastic for those applications. I ordered the ""magic"" ear domes and they made a great product even better. Kudos to Otofonix.Roger Hirschbein"
108,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing product...Very Impressed!,"I have hearing loss which is moderate in my left ear. I spent quite a bit of time researching different hearing aids but didn't want to spend 2-3 thousand dollars on one. I finally bought the Otofonix on May 5th and it was delivered on May 8th. The instructions suggested only using it for couple hours a day but I wore it all the time ever since I received it without any problems. What was amazing was I know longer ask my wife "" What did you say?"". I was walking one day soon after purchasing the aid and heard this noise and thought "" What is that noise I'm hearing?"". It was the rustling of the American Flag in the breeze. Another time I was near a creek and thought again, ""What is that noise I am hearing?"" It was the ripple of the water. Amazing of all the sounds I've been missing for years. About 3-4 times now I've forgotten that the aid was in my hear and jumped into the shower. It was only about 10 seconds and I jump out and wiped off the aid and take a hair dryer to dry it off. It still works fine.  The batteries last about 5 days and I shut it off at bedtime. So, 3 months later I am very happy with this product and would recommend it highly."
108,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love the Otofonix Sound Amplifier!,"This little sound amplifier seems to work just as well as my husband's hearing aids - which cost thousands of dollars.  I've tried both and I can't tell a difference in sound quality.  I was a little confused by the directions at first, but some research on the internet and a phone call with the sellers and I realized how simple it is to change the settings.  I particularly like the the little ""tail"" on this device.  When I tried my husband's hearing aids, they never felt securely seated in my ear, but with the extra bit of tubing tucked into the bottom curve of my ear, it stays securely in place and I never even feel that I'm wearing it.  I bought just one, for my left ear, to see how it worked out.  I now plan to buy one for my right ear.  I've been wearing this little fellow for over a week now and am very pleased with the feel of it and how well it works.  Whenever I put it in I immediately turn down the sound on the television!  Be sure to read and follow the directions carefully and begin by wearing it only a few hours a day, gradually building up.  I'm sure you won't be disappointed and will have saved yourself thousands of dollars."
108,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best hearing aid device for my type of hearing loss,"Oh my, I love these. I was told I needed to get hearing aids from my ENT doctor and I tried some out that I absolutely loved.  Problem is, they would have cost me $7000.00 to get them. I need hearing aids for both ears due to a genetic disorder called otosclerosis.  Anyway, through lots of research and reading so many reviews, I was directed to these.  I got them and one didn't work right. I called the support line and the people there were so helpful and so friendly. She shared some things for me to check, which we did together, and I still couldn't get that side to work. So, she had me send it back for a replacement, which came just a few short days afterwards. I now can hear so well that work will be much easier and watching movies with my son will be much better. I can hear all of the finer sounds again. I would highly recommend these for anyone suffering a mild form of high frequency hearing loss.  My loss will get wose with time, but these should get me through at least for the next 6 years or so. Great price, great product, great customer service.  I'm very happy with these."
108,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very helpful for slight/moderate high frequency hearing loss,"There are many reviews to look through and I found it helpful when I considered buying one.  I am 55 with slight/moderate high frequency hearing loss as documented by testing.  It has been clear to me and people around me as well.  I miss words in certain environments, ask people to repeat themselves, the ususal basic hearing loss issues.  So I bought just one to give it a try and I have been very happy with it. The product only needed just a few minutes to put together and insert.  The settings and volume are easy to control.  I have really only used the ""normal"" setting at a volume 3 or 4 (it goes from 1-10) and have noticed a big improvement in what I hear.  I think people in a similar situation would be happy with the improvement.  It is not perfect, but I find it really helps.  It is funny at times as some sounds, mostly the high freq sounds, are really boosted: paper being crumpled and putting on my ski jacket. It has only been about 2 weeks but this deserves its 5 stars. I'll figure out if I want to get one for the other ear. I hope this helps you decide."
108,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,DO NOT BUY AS A PAIR (until they fix inventory issue),"These work great for my dad and are far more affordable than the hearing aids he used to use.  That's great, since we need to replace them when they get lost or damaged.  BUT DO NOT BUY THESE AS A PAIR -- until their inventory mix-up gets straightened out.  I ordered a pair On April 9, 2023 and received a single box containing just one device.  (When I have purchased pairs in the past, I received two boxes, each containing one device.)  I returned it and ordered replacement pair - and today I once again received a single device instead of a pair."
108,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,If you're wondering if you should buy this the answer is YES!,"This is the first review I've ever bothered to post but, like many customers, I rely heavily on reviews. So in a nutshell: if you've looked at this product and are considering it BUY IT! You have nothing to lose. Not only does the amplifier do everything it claimed to do I also was able to experience first-hand Otofonix's customer service: after having the amplifier for a little less than a month the rocker switch that controls the volume fell off. I don't know if this happens commonly but I do have very thick, unruly hair and wear glasses. So not sure if it is a product issue or me. I contacted the company through Amazon and was told it would take up to two days for a response. I sent the message around 8:00 at night and had a response early the next morning. I was immediately sent a prepaid postage label with clear instructions for return. I was in regular email contact with them and had my replacement in three days (which included a weekend). I am 55 years old and have been struggling with mumblers and whisperers for years. I work in a small law firm where hushed voices are necessary and I realized I was missing about 50% of what people were saying in quiet conversations. I just assumed I would have to go through the process of getting hearing aids and the price tag of thousands of dollars just wasn't feasible. So I read the reviews, saw the 45 day money back guarantee and decided to take the plunge. The difference is amazing...it took no time to adjust to the amplifier for me and is completely comfortable. Great product, great company, great price."
108,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Product and Service,"I was diagnosed with mild, right on the edge of moderate, hearing loss in the upper frequencies a few years ago.  I never considered hearing aids due to the price and friends/family experiences with them.  I finally got tired of asking ""What?"" and not being a part of the conversation while dining out .  So, I looked for a cheaper alternative to traditional hearing aids, and I came across the Otofonix.  I have been using it for over a month and must say that I'm pleased.  It gives a much needed clarity to speech.  Without it, I struggle to understand children and women especially, but now I have no problem hearing what is said.  While I have not been in a restaurant yet, I have been in the park with lots of children.  I can report a better listening experience while watching TV and listening to my record collection.  Some sounds are louder than I like, such as door latches, pans clanging, etc.  Overall, the Otofonix is a great alternative to traditional hearing aids.  I prefer program 1 level 2.Update:  I contacted CS and they were fantastic.  After explaining my issue with some sounds being louder than I like, they helped me find a program and level that was more appropriate for my hearing difficulties.  I switched to program 2 level 4 and those annoying sounds are no longer too loud, but the clarity of speech remains.  I also wanted to try it in my right ear.  Otofonix sent a right ear tube at no cost for me to try.  You will not find better customer service anywhere."
108,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,They work for me,"I have had a set of these for 14 months and have come more and more to depend on them.  I have never had the more expensive hearing aids, but I have a friend who has a $6000 pair.  When he and I compare how good his are to the Otofonix (dha), I think that mine are pretty good.  For instance:  my friend says that he cannot go to a restaurant with his and expect to hear much what is being said.  These dha are also  limited in their use in very loud situations but, I realized, even if I had regular hearing and went to a loud restaurant, I probably couldn’t understand what people were saying! But, I actually can hear a lot more than I used to hear even under those circumstances. When they are really useful is when I go to meetings.  I absolutely cannot understand what everyone is saying without these.  I love birds and, with these, I can hear them.I got used to them pretty quickly. At first I was hesitant to wear them because, well, I just didn’t want to wear hearing aids.  Now I find that I want to put them on so that I can be a part of the world!I just bought a 3rd one (just one, not a pair) because I got to thinking that if one went on the blink, I could send it in to be repaired and still have a pair to wear.I had tried a cheaper dha’s but sent them back.  It just didn’t do what these do.  And, the Otofonix has come down in price!"
108,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,(UPDATE 11-14-16)  Otofonix = Excellent customer service!!!!,"I purchased the sound amplifier 8-6-16 and it failed after 3 months (bad mic).  I contacted Otofonix and they requested a return for evaluation.  Otofonix gave me a return authorization number and I returned the defective sound amplifier.  I received a new replacement in less than a week! Otofonix reminded me the sound amplifier is guaranteed 1 year from date of purchase.  I still love my Otofonix sound amplifiers.I have Moderate hearing loss.  Over several years I have gone through two sets of Costco Hearing Aids.  Costco has never been able to adjust the hearing aids to be loud enough without feeding back (whistling).  I have worked in Electronics all my life and hate getting ripped off by having to purchase a hearing aid that a audiologist (joke) must program with a computer.  My hearing loss is at the higher speech frequencies (as are most people).  The built in Otofonix Sound Amplifier program takes this into account and is preprogrammed to do just that.  I use Program 1 all the time. I especially like the fact that I can adjust the volume level if necessary (Not possible with Costco hearing aids). Program 4 is very loud and offers plenty of amplification power.With just one Otofonix Amplifier in my left ear, my hearing has greatly improved.  My wife and grandkids notice a marked improvement in my hearing."
108,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Started great,"When it arrived it was set for level one volume 5, worked great, wore it to a restaurant and head sounds anew.  Tested on tv and my lady and was very pleased.  Then it seemed to lose some of the sound quality, changed the battery though it was only a couple days, used my google device as it has good volume control, ran through all the programs and volume settings and could not return to the quality of when it first was used.  Customer service was excellent and walked me through all the maintenance steps and offered to check it out if I returned it.  There developed a squeal very noticeable to those at the St. Patrick dinner, could not return to the quality of yesteryear so sent it back for inspection.  Still do not know what caused the deteriorations I experienced.  My hearing in the problem right ear ended up[ being the same with the device or without.  Have scheduled to check for ear wax and have a hearing test as I sure want it to work as it did."
108,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,I could not be happier. Just to be clear,"I had to replace a pair of $3000.00 hearing aids as they were falling apart and because I did not sign up for monthly maintenance, they were going to charge me $200.00 to plug my hearing aids into their computer for an adjustment. Anyway, bottom line was that I needed to make a change. After reading the reviews and I decided to give these a try. Money back guaranty, so I did.  These hearing aids not only had the 4 settings of my previous pair but had 10 volume settings that could be adjusted on each level. I am now turning DOWN the television.  They also use the same batteries as my old ones.  I could not be happier. Just to be clear, I tested at a 60% loss in one ear and 40% in the other, so it is not just a minor problem. Obviously I did not do the proper research the first time or I would not have chosen the ones I did. For those looking for the first time, ask about service: how, where, how much.  My old hearing aids could only be serviced by the company that sold them, they owned the computer program.  Rechargeable ones might sound nice, but what happens after the fixed battery is dead?  I am very happy with these and not just because  of the price, that is a bonus, they actually perform so much better, I am just amazed!!!!"
108,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Seriously Awesome,"My mom has had horrible hearing in one ear ever since I was a kid. Because we didn’t have a lot of money growing up, she never considered paying over $1,000 for a hearing aid. Her being nearly deaf in one ear was just something she lived with. When I found this hearing aid, I was skeptical of the price and reviews, but decided that their return policy was so fair that it was worth a shot. So I gave this to her as an early Christmas gift. I gave her the disclaimer that this wasn’t a $1,000 hearing aid, so I wasn’t sure of the quality (which made her much more willing to accept the gift) and that the booklet it comes with states that it might take a week or more to get used to.She tried it on and immediately loved it. There was no adjustment period for her, only the newly acquired ability to hear in both ears. It was a joy to watch. Within a day she said she felt weird when she took it off. It’s been awesome hearing her reflect on all of these daily experiences she’s having for the first time with two ears.Customer service was also awesome. I had ordered the wrong ear, and put in a request to return with the intention of ordering another one. They called my phone and informed me that they would sent me out a replacement tube."
108,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Seems to help me. It helps to read ALL ...,"Seems to help me. It helps to read ALL the directions and pay attention and experiment with the different size cups and tubes  I don't even notice wearing it, most times.  Several times I have gotten ready to sleep and realized was still wearing it.However, there is one room, at work, that has an occupancy monitor (ultrasonic), when I pass by it, the unit makes rather loud clicks.  There is also on rest room with the same effect.  If I have to be in either room for any length of time, I have to remove the unit.  That style of monitor appear to be in several other rooms, no problem, so I suspect the monitors are defective.  Just thought I'd mention that as a heads up.A couple times, when it was raining lightly, but the time I walked, uncovered, into the building, I got some static.  However, that cleared up when I removed it, made sure it and my ear/hair was dry, and opened and closed the battery compartment.I am considering one for the other ear,"
108,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Easy to use controls for volume and programming,"Easy to use controls for volume and programming.  Program one seems to be the best for me.  The remaining programs degrade the aid for me and are not of any use.  For the price it is a very good deal.One complaint with the company.  When ordering accessories, they tack on a $6.75 shipping charge.  This is crazy.  Plus the cost of batteries there is more than 2 times what Amazon charges.  Wish Amazon would offer the accessories where shipping would be cost free.Update 10/12/2017 Company customer service was very responsive to my concern about shipping.  They will be adding a new shipping option that users should be pleased with.  My rating has been updated to 4 stars.I have found that  moving the battery to off position causes the program to go to program 4 when moving to the on position.  Since I prefer program 1, this means a reprogramming is required with each restart.  Not a big thing, but one that should not be necessary."
108,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Very pleasantly surprised,"OK, I would make this 4 1/2 stars if I could.  I was very iffy about this but there were so many good reviews I decided to try it, especially due to their return policy.  I wasn't sure if it would work well for my type of hearing loss.  It definitely amplifies things well.  If you are listening to one of those tv shows where everyone seems to mumble, it still isn't 100% but much better.  I can definitely hear better when someone is speaking to me, and even though background noises are amplified you can still hear well in a crowd - just have to get used to hearing more than I used to and I'm already noticing that my brain starts to block out the noise I don't want to hear.  There is a stange phenomenon because I only bought one.  Now the other ear feels like it is sort of clogged up when I have this in.  That is not a fault of the equipment though - I think I'll just have to get one for the other ear.  I found it VERY easy to put in your ear and use, easy to adjust even while you are wearing it, which I was concerned about after reading some of the reviews.  I would definitely recommend, especially for mild to moderate hearing loss such as I have.  The battery lasts about 1 week which isn't too bad and is very easy to replace.  Once the battery is in place it stays in place until you pull it out."
108,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,"They didn't work for me but, they are good product and a super company. I urge you two give them a try.","Otofonix Personal Sound Amplifier, Digital Hearing Amplifier, Noise Cancellation and Volume Control (Pair, Beige)
The only reason that I have given the Otofonic Personal Sound Amplifiers a 4-star rating rather than a 5-star rating is because they simply did not fit my hearing loss. When the quality of the product, the price of the product, the fast shipping of the product, and the ease of returning the product, all our five star quality, it is a shame that they did not fit my hearing loss. I tried them for 3 weeks. I am 75 years old and have been in the sales and service professions all of my life, part of which was a licensed hearing aid distributor. This has been the most trouble-free transaction that I have ever seen especially, when you are working with a company on the internet and through the mail. I did not realize that my return authorization was already received when I received the product. The return could not have been more simplified. I mailed back the amplifiers on Monday and today, 2 Days Later, I have received notice that my credit has already been issued. I would urge anyone who realizes that they have a hearing loss and feel that this product might help them, to try it. I have never seen any more of a hassle free transaction than what this was. I commend the people at Otofhonix for this and thank them for the chance to try their product, even though it did not work for me. Norm"
108,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Try It Out,"I tried this out for my left ear which has mild to moderate loss in high frequencies, using the ""open"" ear piece.  There is much to like about this device:  Can get voice telephone support from friendly and helpful people; the size of battery makes for easy insertion and removal; the battery actually stays in place when slightly opening the door for it; the volume/channel switch is sized well to make it very easy to manipulate when behind the ear.  The four different programs may well be very useful with someone else's hearing deficiencies, but for mine only 1 program seemed useful.  An issue I had was that in a large room setting (actually my church) where I tried to increase the volume to hear the preacher, the unit start squealing too much and I had to back off to my more normal use setting.  But that meant that I could not hear the preacher as well as I wanted to.  For that reason, I decided to return the device during the evaluation period because another device I tried out worked better for me in church.  But because of all the positives I have listed, I think others should certainly give this an evaluation and might be very happy with its match to their own hearing deficiencies."
108,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Astounding. Updated review,"I'd give five stars but have never used a hearing aid. My hearing has deteriorated very slowly, but lately, I've had people having to speak Louder. It's annoying for them and troublesome for myself. I'm seventy five, so it's about time to upgrade my body.Day one:I ought to have watched the video offered on line. Eventually, I figured out that I needed the smallest dome.Day two:I drove and shopped where I finally had the opportunity to speak with someone. Amusingly, I forgot I had it on, but I enjoyed the clear conversation. Then I took off my eyeglasses, and the aid popped off and onto the floor. The clerk was astonished by its tiny size. Now I'll Lift the glasses rather than pulling them.Customer service :Outstanding. I had to call in advance because I'm under five three and needed a shorter hearing tube. The woman simply asked for my name and said they'd handle it. Wow.Today I called and she recognized my name. I thought I was missing the closed dome, but she directed me to the correct bag. I asked for the tiny size, and it's on the way.Function :I'm using it on setting one, and I've had to turn down the volume on the phone and iPad. I can easily hear my cat purr, not just feel it. I can hear the furnace turning on, whereas before the sound was faint.This gadget is bleeding edge technology, as the saying goes. The rocker adjustment takes practice but is super simple. The entire thing is perfectly engineered for comfort. Other reviews said that you forget it's on your ear. So true.Plus, the trial period and return policy is consumer friendly. Try it.OK. It's May and I've had annoying problems, which I accepted. Then I changed batteries and had an endless squealing sound. Various attempts dud not help. The woman at customer service once Again assisted me. The trouble was that the audio tube was twisted into the wrong position. Simple fix.Ask about the Magic Dome, and they'll send it for free.Now I give this gadget and company A FIVE."
108,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent Customer Service****,"******UPDATE****** I was able to reach out to customer service and a wonderful woman helped me troubleshoot and get my amplifier running. She also told me if I had any other issues to call and they would be more than happy to help me. I must say, I wasn't expecting such excellent customer service. I feel reassured knowing that if there are any more issues I can get the help I need. I have hearing loss in both ears but its more severe in my right ear and I purchased for that one even though it's recommended to get it for the ear that hears better. It makes a big difference, more than I expected. You don't realize how significant your hearing loss is until you experience hearing again. It does take some time to adjust to hearing all the sounds so be prepared for that. I was thrown by how loud some normal things like setting down a glass was but you get used to it with consistent use.  I feel very  happy and blessed  because I can now hear my beautiful grandaughters clearly again! my friends, family, and music is all more clear! I can't afford the $2,000-$4,000 I was quoted from an audiologist for a hearing aid so spending $300 is affordable and life-changing! I promised myself I would change my review if Otofonix proved it's customer service to me. If you're suffering from hearing loss, take the chance on this. They honor their guarantee and as long as you can rest assured in that, isn't it worth it? ***To the patient, sweet woman from customer service, I didn't catch your name but I'm hoping you recognize me by this comment. Thank you so much for all your help!***I got this product and it was great but stopped working right after the return period to amazon ran out. I wrote Otofonix for an RA and haven't received one. I am so dissappointed because initially it was wonderful. I only wore it a few times as I work long hours and I didn't want to try to adjust to it while at work."
108,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,I'm some where between love it and like it,"I'm some where between love it and like it. In the past I have worn molded in the ear Siemens. They were uncomfortable and for me could never be adjusted right. Three thousand dollars and many trips to the audiologist. For the last three years I have used Resound hearing aids. They were 5 yrs. old when given to me. They are digital open fit. I paid $500 for life time adjustment etc. They retested my hearing and reprogrammed them for my need. Even though not perfect they are very good. New they cost well over $5000.00.My Otofonix is, after about a week right next to perfect. The order from Amazon, the shipping, and the concern from customer service in regard to help setting the unit up has been excellent, better than any item I have purchased online. The hearing aid itself is great. It is open fit which is best for me. I couldn't adjust the volume on either of the hearing aids I used before, the Otofonix has ten settings for volume alone. For me that is a big advantage. It has 4 settings for different environments, I haven't had opportunity to test those yet. The plastic case has a better design. It seems to be thicker plastic than my resound, has a solid feel to it but still light weight over the ear. When the battery door is open the battery doesn't fall out. I love that. Comparing the price of this unit to the Resound I will buy this any day.I do not work for Otofonix, I am 74, the major portion of our income is S.S. My hearing loss is severe and the worst part is in the higher tones. Though this Otofonix would meet the needs of most people perfectly, just for my own specific needs, to make it perfect for me I could use less base, just minor, and a little more in higher tones. Still I have to say I love it."
108,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Much improved hearing,"I'm really in the 4.5 star camp.  On the five star side, I was impressed that I have gotten two follow-up E-mails.  And, the E-mails reitterated their 45 day return policy with no questions.  Also, the website with it's supporting manuals and videos are a good resource.  I've had it for a week, and I'm still on the original battery.  I'm hearing some sounds that I've not heard in years such as the car's directional signal clicking.The device is very easy to set up.  I literally opened the box at 5 PM and was heading to a restaurant at 5:10 PM.  The rocker switch is very easy to use.  I was really happy to be able to hear the watercress so much better.  I was surprised about how many background conversations I could pick up.The device is also very comfortable.  I wear glasses and do not notice the device at all.  The ear piece fits well and is comfortable to wear all day.I purchased the device to test out a 'hearing aid'.  I did not want to plunge in and invest several thousands of dollars.  So far, I may not even take the plunge.On the four star side, It is sensitive to wind noise.  And although they are clear about the description, I was hoping that I could hear spoken voice a little better.  Also, the quality of sound is not like my natural hearing.  However, it has been a dramatic improvement.  I am curious about the sound quality of a hearing aid.I only have it for my right ear.  I'll likely buy another for the left. And, the fact that I will likely buy another is why I gave it 5stars."
108,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Outstanding value and performance in a personal amplification device,"First, Amazon is great!  I received a replacement left ear unit two days after ordering it.  About the Otofonix Elite: The device (I have left and right units) works as well as hearing aids that were produced a half-dozen years ago and that cost $4k.  No, they aren't tailored for the best frequency response over the entire audio range as needed by the individual, but if the user follows the manufacturer's instructions and selects the correct amplification mode (there are four) and chooses the appropriate amplification level using the rocker switch, the Elite is good for low to moderate hearing loss.  The units are small, comfortable and fit well, but can be pulled out when adjusting clothing, glasses and COVID face masks.  The units are so unobtrusive, the user may forget and sleep while wearing them or (God forbid) shower or swim with them. If the owner has tinnitus, the increased presence of sound due the performance of the units diminishes the usual ringing. The battery door is delicate and, although I haven't experienced damage to it, it could possibly be broken off if handled roughly. Four hundred bucks for a pair? Fantastic!  Get a spare pair."
108,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Exceeded my expectations!,"I have been wearing hearing aids for twelve years. I have moderate hearing loss in the higher frequencies.  I lost one of my hearing aids a few months ago and did not have enough money to replace it.  I started looking at hearing amplifiers just to be able to turn the volume down on the tv so that my husband wouldn't have to suffer through the increased volume.  My first purchase was a Britzgo.  It suited my purpose but even on the lowest setting it was too loud.  It also distorted sound.  I returned it and after reading reviews decided to risk the money and try the Otofonix.  It's been four weeks since I started wearing it.  I love it.  It's comfortable to wear and sound quality is excellent.  It works as well, if not better than my original hearing aid.  Controls are easy to use.  I wear it all the time, not just for tv and plan on replacing my other hearing aid with another Otofonix soon.  The cost of my original hearing aids was $4500.  As far as I am concerned the Otofonix is a hearing aid and the savings is incredible.The only cons are that it doesn't have an on/off switch or a telephone setting but for the price, I'm not complaining.Update:  I have been wearing my original Otofonix for approximately six months.  I was so pleased with it that I purchased one for the other ear about three months ago.  All is working well and I am pleased with purchase.  I mentioned lack of a telephone setting in my original review.  Much to my surprise, I discovered that it was not needed.  There is no feedback when I hold the phone to my ear."
108,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Exceeded my expectations,"These are my first Hearing Amplifiers and I was prepared to be underwhelmed. After reading many reviews and disclaimers of various hearing amplifiers my expectations were low. I decided to check out a highly rated hearing amplifier on Amazon. They were on the mid to high $$ for Amazon.  I've had many hearing test over the last 20 years that showed moderate hearing loss. Both workers comp and my private insurance said that my hearing loss did not warrant hearing aides, even though I emphasized that I was having more and more difficulty following conversations that I couldn't watch the speakers lips to fill in the blanks. My wife was getting more and more frustrated at having to repeat herself. I was an Airborne infantry soldier in the Army (Aircraft Turbines, gunfire, & explosions for 10 yrs), an Army Nation Guard Flight medic (Helicopter turbines 15 yrs), and a Professional Firefighter/Paramedic (Sirens & diesel engines 22 yrs). I was very surprised with the significant improvement in my ability to follow conversations without seeing the lips of who was speaking. I started out at the higher end of the volume setting and over the first week slowly backed them down to the mid range. I tell my wife they are magic. I can hear things I haven't heard in many years. At first I was excited and then a little overwhelmed by all the new sounds. I'm still working on finding the sweet spot, I'm in my second week of using them. It still kind of blows my mind when I take them out at night for bed, and the new sounds are gone, it reinforces every night that they are magic. I'm wearing them 15 hours a day and did my first battery change at 8 days."
108,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Super pleased Stay tuned for updates.,I received this yesterday it appears to work well. I am just going to have to adjust to it. The only thing that is driving me nuts its the Itching. I assume I will adjust to it. I am going to be patient with it. I will post updates as time goes on. So far I am pleased with it with a few minor issues1st 24 hours went well just had to learn to adjust it for the environments I am in at the time. If you have it turned up loud it you will think people are yelling at you. I exercise in the evenings so I remove it during exercise. I know I have some hearing loss.Update 9/24/2017 The itching has stopped. Got my hearing tested yesterday. Hearing loss in both ears. Ordered one for my left ear. I also ordered from Otofonix the large closed domes for reduced feed back and better amplification of sound. (I do feel they should have enclosed a large closed dome instead of me having to order the Domes from the directly from Otofonix to get full use of the device and this is the reason for 4 stars)Update 9/25/2017I really do like this. When talking to someone I can adjust the volume until it is comfortable and not to loud and they just think I am playing with my ear. The weak link is the sound tubes. I would suggest ordering extras and keep them handy. But I suspect if handled correctly the sound tubes will last a decent amount of time. I am going to order 2 of each for the Left and Right ear.Update 9/27/2017I am pleased with the one for the Right ear at this point. The one for the Left ear arrives today. So we will see how it works. I did order a hearing aid dryer I will use daily to attempt to increase their life. humidity body sweat and rain water can decrease the life of hearing aids.Update 9/28/2017I received the one for the left ear yesterday. My ear canals are two sizes. I have known this for years. I am hearing better I am using the medium closed dome. I hear better with the closed dome if you have a good fit there is zero feed back. I am waiting on my order from Otofonix for my large closed domes I ordered 6 of them to reduce the shipping cost. What I am finding amazing is there has been no itching in my left ear. One thing with the closed dome I am sure I hear better. I am hearing sounds I have not usually heard walking around my office.I have both set to program 2 Sound Level 4. I am amazed at what I have been missing. Cannot wait to try the large closed dome in my right ear. I am sure it will be a improvement. According to USPS Tracking the large domes are scheduled to arrive today. So I can give a improved update tomorrow on how they are performing. So stay tuned.Update 9/29/2017Well USPS did not deliver the large closed domes. I am disappointed. I understand they will arrive today. One thing I noticed every sound . Including the turn signals on my car is easier to hear.Update 10/1/2017Hearing with the large dome are much improved. I am using one in each ear from what I can tell the large domes work better. I do not need a high volume when at home.Update 10/4/2017Using Medium closed dome in Left ear Large Closed Dome in right ear. Both set to Program 1 Vol. Level 1. I do not wear at home since I feel my son is yelling when he is not. I just wear now when out of the house. I am getting 8 days off the battery.Update 10/5/2017The left battery died after 8 days. Just changed the battery today for the first time.10/10/2017I switched to the open Domes over the weekend I believe they are more comfortable. My wife says I am not as loud when I talk now. she says I always sounded mad to people that did not know me. I have been  told for 20+ years that I was loud. No telling how long my hearing has been bad.Update 10/11/2017 The on off switch for these you open the battery door and let the battery hang on the door. Now my battery on one is sticking and has fallen out a time or two. I emailed Otofonix I am waiting for a response to my E-mail.Response to my E-mail they are going to replace the one with the defective battery door. I just need to ship it to them.Update 10/10/2017The replacement arrived with the same issue. I did a simple fix I took a kitchen knife and pressed the battery tab down a little. Works perfect with no problem. I wish they had told me to do that.Update 10/18/2017Something I had been noticing and thought it was the PSAH but was not. I was hearing a low pitch beep every morning and could not figure it out. One of my co-workers was in my office and I asked if he heard it. He stated it was from my coffee maker. I did not even know it beeped until I got the PSAH so I really am impressed. Setting are presently at left ear program 1 sound Level 3 Right program 1 Sound level 4 I think this is the ideal setting. Going to change my review to five stars.UPdate10/20/2018I put these on in the morning as I  head out the door and wear them until I get home. Do they help yes.Update. 11/20/2017I am still very pleased with them .I use them more during the week. Not sure how I am doing on Battery life have not really kept track .I know I do not change them that often. But I am very pleased with them.Update 12/12/2017I have been using Otofonix since September and they work very well. I can detect a major drop in my hearing when removed. I am Changing batteries about I believe every 7 to 8 days depending on how much I wear them. I forget I have them in most of the time. My wife and son are Loud so I usually remove them when I am home or turn the Volume down a little. But I hear so much better. I have not been out to eat since I got them. But we are having Christmas dinner at a Restaurant this year so I will report how they work in a noisy environment for me. But as of this time I am 100 percent pleased.Update 12/25/2017They helped during Christmas Diner with no problem at all. I have reduced the Volume both setting Level 2 and Sound Level 1 in Left Ear and Sound Level 2 in Right ear. My wife and son are both loud but there are time I have trouble hearing them. But if I turn the Volume up I am telling my son to lower his voice. If I need to in public I can always turn them up. Right now I am wearing them 14 to 15 hours a day.Update 1/2/2019The left aid died not sure if I am going to purchase them again 300 dollars a year is not a good bargain for me. Going to attempt some less expensive one.
108,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,"After a few months, volume loss","I have mild to moderate hearing loss and this PSAP device does well to help hearing TV and radio. But conversations are still just as muddled, but louder. I know it is not supposed to make conversations clearer, but it should help a little. I started getting shrill whistles randomly, especially while driving. The first few weeks were no problem, but after a while, the random whistle is a rude surprise.  I have tried different settings, volumes and ear domes, but still get the random shrill whistle. I am sure as PSAPs go, this one is okay. But the random shrill whistle makes this a marginal product in my opinion.**Update** Poor workmanship. Today the volume dropped to the point that it is no longer helpful to me. I own two of these and thought it was my hearing that changed overnight. But it was the device. I swapped ears and ear tubes and tips and the problem is in the device itself, not the tube or ear tips. The volume loss is about 60%. There is no discernible difference to me with the device in or out.These PSAP devices are simply poor quality and disposable."
108,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Better than my custom (and expensive!) hearing aids!,"I have worn hearing aids for 5 years, due to 30 years of orchestral playing, and a condition called Otosclerosis, where the bones in the inner ear fuse together. My former hearing aids were purchased through and fitted by an audiologist.  However, I always struggled with the clarity of peoples' words.  My old hearing aids finally started falling apart, and I just couldn't stomach spending 3-5k on another pair that did not help to the extent I needed. So, I turned to Amazon to see what I could find, and I appreciated the reviews on the Otofonix.The Otofonix amplifiers arrived quickly, and were easy to set up, mostly based on my prior experience with hearing aids. They were immediately louder and more clear than my previous aids.  Initially, EVERYTHING was louder, as is the case when you start with hearing aids, or have them adjusted.  The brain adjusts, and within a day or two, things balanced out.I have very small ear canals, and could only use the small domes.  The closed domes do amplify better, but because they were too big for my ear, I experienced too much occlusion; my voice got really loud inside my head as the dome plugged my ear.  Otofonix customer service really worked with me on this, and sent some smaller domes in different styles.PROS:-My friends say I'm not asking, ""What was that?"" all the time, and I am hearing the clarity of voices in my office and in small group settings much better than I was.  I am much less frustrated!-These are clearer and louder than my expensive hearing aids.  For this, I give it the 4 stars!-Otofonix Customer Service was great, and helped me through some initial issues on the phone, and even sent me some extra domes to try.CONS:-There are no signal tones to let you know the amplifiers are on, when you first close the battery compartment.-There are no tones to let you know which volume level you are on.-I experience more feedback with these than my old hearing aids.  For example, sitting in front of my laptop at work, and playing music through it or a client, certain tones or notes will make a short and sharp squeal in the ear.  Sometimes coming in close proximity to certain objects will also create this noise.Wishlist!-Alert tones for volume and when the units are first turned on-A remote that would allow quick on/off or volume changes (I'm a musician, and can't tolerate wearing amplifiers when I play, but would appreciate being able to flip them on/off quickly to hear colleagues or the conductor)Thank you, Otofonix for your research and development in this area, and for providing an affordable option for hearing amplification!"
108,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,WOW ... This Product Lives Up to Expectations and Then Some,"I seldom review products but this is one that is truly outstanding and deserves accolades.It arrived ready to go.  A quick skim of instructions was all that was needed and this little PSAP (personal sound amplification product) was on my ear and working.All of a sudden sounds I hadn't heard in years were audible.  As I expected the higher frequencies were the most noticeable ... outdoors I could hear birds chirping, frogs croaking, even the two metal tags on my dog's collar clanking together.  Group conversations are now intelligible.  I can watch TV and make out the dialog without blasting others out of the room.  The only down side - now I can hear ALL my wife's requests.The control is quick and easy to use.  The modes of operation are each distinct and beneficial.  My favorite is mode 2 that suppresses background in noisy environments like restaurants.  It really works well.  This week at a regular group breakfast with my buddies I was able to hear and understand what was being said without asking for repeats.  The acid test of mode 2 was yesterday when I could make out radio dialog (at a relatively low volume) with the window down at about 50MPH.There are changes that you'll find your brain will adjust to.  You'll hear sounds that you create that you haven't heard for a long time like the crunch of walking on gravel and probably most noticeably, your own voice.  It only took me a couple of days to get used to these additional sounds.So far 5 days on the first battery - good news.  One caveat, it's easy to forget you have this device in your ear.  Cover up in a rain and be sure to take it off before you shower.So far I'm thrilled with this PSAP.  Thanks Otofonix for a great product at a reasonable price!"

108,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Lots to like, but falls a little short where it really matters","My review is mostly based on my previous experience with the ""Simplicity Smart Touch Digital Over-the-Ear Hearing Aid"" sold through Wal Mart's web site. That unit sells for approximately the same price as the Otofonix unit here. Based on the great reviews I decided to try the Otofonix after I lost my SImplicity. The two devices are quite similar in many ways, but with some key differences. The toggle-type volume/program control on the Otofonix is easier to adjust than the single button on the Simplicity, and the number of volume settings and four separate programs are a real plus, and the main reason I decided to try this unit rather than purchase the Simplicity again. The Simplicity only has four amplification settings and no additional  program settings.  The Otofonix is slightly larger, which is noticeable when putting on glasses, but not really problematic.  It is quite comfortable otherwise.For me, the Simplicity has one real advantage though.  I have the normal high-end hearing loss that most people experience as they age.  The Simplicity unit seems to emphasize these highs better than the Otofonix unit does.  While the published specifications provided by both manufacturers are limited, they do seem to bear out what I'm hearing.  The Simplicity has a higher published frequency range, 8,000 Hz vs. 5,500 for the Otofonix. That meant when I put on the Simplicity I would notice big increases in things like birds & crickets chirping that I normally don't hear very well. With the Otofonix, the difference is not as great. I'm am able to compensate somewhat for this with volume and program settings, but the Otofonix always seems to amplify the whole frequency range instead of just the highs that I really need. While the Otofonix might seem more ""natural"" sounding, the Simplicity unit is better for normal conversation, where it makes it easier to distinguish between consonants like ""f"" and :""s"".  I give the natural sound of the Otofonix the edge in noisy environments, but it's less useful to me overall.  One of the reasons I decided to buy hearing aids in the first place was because I was walking the dog one day and couldn't hear a rattlesnake that both my girlfriend and my dog alerted me to. I haven't had such an encounter since I got hearing aids, but I suspect that the Simplicity would allow me to hear this much better than the Otofonix would.That said, the Otofonix four programs and ten volume settings are very useful.  If they had an additional program that accentuated the high frequencies more, the Otofonox would be close to perfect."
108,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Why do audiologists have to have you come back repeatedly?  This is much better.,"first let me say that the difference between ""hearing aids"" and PSA'S is nothing.  I have used several different hearing aids and this is every bit as good as the most expensive.  I deliberately waited one month before doing a review to be sure I had the full impact of the device.  I have severe hearing loss in my right ear and moderate loss in my left.  you should never wear just one aid if you can afford two but one is better than none.  I purchased one only to make sure I liked this aid.  Now for the real review.This device is tiny compared to the others I've had and this is the first open dome I've used.  After I figured out how to adjust it for my hearing and the fact that it was an open dome the sound reproduction is awesome. At first I didn't like it but I didn't understand it.  On a Saturday I sent an email to otophonix asking for help and according to their office hours I should not have had a return call until Monday.  Thirty minutes after I sent the email I had a call from one of the reps and ten minutes after that I had a hearing aid that I loved.  I can now walk through four programs designed for just about any environment I might encounter.  some of the hearing aids I had in the past didn't allow a full volume control, in other words it would only turn down as low as the manufacturer wanted.  Quite often in loud environments this was still too loud.  The otophonix covers the full spectrum from 0 to wow.  The sound tube is far smaller than anything I have used in the past and I think is a huge contributor to the comfort of this aid.  It took me a bit to get used to the open dome affect.  It doesn't leave you with that plugged ear hearing that I was so used to.  The result (I think) of the open dome after you get used to it is comfort and more natural hearing.  I kept asking my wife to talk to me because I didn't think it was working (no buzz, no hum, no echo, nothing)  after a few days of this she said ""I know it's working because you don't say what, huh, or could you repeat that nearly as often as you used to.  Other people noticed this too but oddly they didn't notice the new aid because it is so small and I have very short hair.  It is so comfortable twice I have forgotten and left it on in the shower and once I slept with it all night. I have never had this happen before.  It didn't do any damage to mine but I don't recommend showering with your aid in. after the second week I would suddenly realize during the day that I couldn't feel my aid and I would have to touch my ear to make sure I hadn't lost it.  With all my previous aids I couldn't wait to get home and get the darn thing out of my ear.  Battery life is far better than anything I've used prior.  The otophonix is averaging five to seven days per battery and the best I can ever recall was three days with one of the others.  I priced batteries for it at Walmart (i'm still using the pack that came with it) and at Walmart your average monthly cost for batteries would be about 1.60 to 2.00 dollars.  The one time that I had a problem with it was due to the ear piece and sound tube being stopped up.  You will receive a very fine piece of line to run through the tube and a brush to clean the ear piece.  One cleaning and it worked perfectly again.  One great thing is when I'm working in my shop I can wear my hearing protection without removing my hearing aid.  I get no feed back.  I also wear wireless headphones when watching TV at night to keep from bothering my wife.  I do not have to remove the aid and it does not over amplify or cause feedback.  I don't even need to reduce the volume on the aid but I have learned that I need to turn the volume way down on the headset.  During the day I can now watch TV with my wife without having to turn the volume up so loud she has to leave the room.  I used to have to wear my headset to keep this from happening and when she wanted to comment on something I would have to pull off the headset and ask her to repeat it.  I know for her this was very annoying as it would be for anyone.  Now we can do away with the headset and have a normal discussion while watching a program.  I had missed that a great deal.The only cons I found with this device is that it is so small it was difficult to change the battery and it is difficult for me to handle the program/volume control switch.  But these are small things to me compared to being able to hear my grandkids, my wife, my students at school, and hearing the birds while sitting on my front porch.  All this without spending a few thousand dollars for a so called ""hearing aid""."
108,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,This Hearing Aids models volume control button detach in about 3rd month,It amplified sound well but its volume control buttons dislodged from hearing aids in about 3rd month of usage. In my opinion the volume control buttons style itself is prone to unloose from its position/seat/attachment . I retired from physician practice in other country but not a doctor in USA. Due to buttons falling off it became useless. I retain it because sometime i dream/wish amazon or seller may help me in returning this H. aid.  I bought the same sellers other model (not having similar button style)  at Amazon which is working well for last 4 or more months. I am spending time in writing to help seller improve products volume control buttons.
108,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,What a pleasant surprise! Gets better and better!,"I read the reviews and decided to try the Otofonix rather than spend thousands.  Have to admit I didn't expect it to be great but for me it is!  I read the instructions and watched the video.  Arrived yesterday and I started to experiment.  The attached tube was perfect for me.  Tried both the open and closed domes, closed was better.  Wore it for several hours on day one.  It was comfortable and at times didn't even remember it was there. When I speak, my own voice is amplified and I'm more aware of it but it's not something that bothered me.  Watching TV had been one of my issues.  Before, depending on channel, my volume indicator on TV would be anywhere between 20-30.  With the Otofonix, I was able to lower TV volume to 14-16.  While driving, I was more aware of traffic, car and road noise, definitely not a bad thing.  My next test will be a restaurant setting.  Even though It does have a setting for reducing background noice, I'm not expecting perfection but hopefully to be able to carry on a conversation.  Will update review after that.  Overall, I am very pleased with performance and so happy I decided to take a chance on Otofonix.  If I ever need a second one, I would definitely purchase another.  Update 2/11/17:  Went to a restaurant the other night and, again, was surprised at how well the Otofonix worked in a noisy environment.  For the first time in a long time, I was able to hear all conversations, even those at the far end across the way.  Can't stress enough, read the instructions and watch the video to determine the best settings.  Wish I had known about the Otofonix sooner.  I purchased the protection plan the next day, well worth it!Update 7/4/17-customer service is the BEST!  As previously mentioned, I purchased the Protection Plan.  Last week, I noticed the unit didn't seem to be working as well as previously.  Called Otofonix and spoke to a very nice rep who asked as well as answered questions.  I mentioned that I had tried 3-4 different batteries, different settings, changed the dome and cleaned the tube.  She then sent me prepaid postage and told me to return the unit for replacement.  They had the old unit back by 6/29 and I had my new unit by 7/1.  Thank you Otofonix! Great company!"
108,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Product and Great Service,"So you can spend thousands for hearing aids or you can spend a few hundred on these Otofonix units. With the medical grade units you are paying a large multiple for all the regulatory compliance and distribution through hearing centers with their 100% mark ups. What you get with the medical grade units is an appliance that matches your hearing loss curve. With the Otofonix you get an appliance that is tuned to the most typical hearing loss. So maybe for 5 or 10% of the people who have a very atypical loss curve the Otofonix might underperform the units costing thousands, but for the rest of us these Otofonix units are every bit the quality of the more expensive units. The sound quality and the noise reduction are every bit as good as any unit I have paid thousands for.  The Otofonix has 10 level of sound amplification so it really can cover a large range of hearing loss cases. I really love them, and at the Amazon price, I don't live in fear of losing or damaging on and being out $1500!Also, I will add the customer service and support is first rate. The informational videos they provided are clear complete and comprehensive. Just by watching their videos I can complete understand how to best set-up use my hearing aids.  I did have a slight problem with one of the units with the connection between the ear tube and the amplifier. One e-mail to Otofonix and I instantly was taken care of and had new unit in my hand two days later.Yes their are less expensive choices out there, and I did try one first, but the performance and quality was obviously no where near the level of the medical grade units I have used or the Otofonix. Yes there are times you need to put your health first and spend what it takes regardless of the cost, but this the case where you can spend significantly less and for the great majority of people get every bit the performance and quality of the high cost alternative."
108,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,A fair value for the  price.,"It was easy to get comfortable wearing it. VERY subtle hearing improvement in most tone ranges, however, in a few tone ranges the sound is over amplified.  The sound of a small, plastic water bottle being squished really comes through.  For me, the differences between the four program modes is almost indistinguishable.  Wears well with glasses. Proper ear tube fit is critical for comfort and performance. Customer support was knowledgeable and helpful."
108,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Item broke,Left ear volume adjuster fell off and cannot adjustVolume.  Please replace!!!!
108,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worked well,"I have bad tinnitus so nothing fixes that. It worked well for me, used it on the right side. It was nice to hear my self walking through the leaves, amazing.  Noise cancelation I did not see it working at all IMO seems the number 4 was best for me not much variability . I did get it wet in the shower multiple times and also from rain . if you get it out of the wet as quick as you can and take the battery out than place it in a bag of dry rice for a day or two maybe 3 days one time. But it kept working. I recently lost it bummer they are bit  expensive for my blood."
108,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Good design, robust execution, extremely helpful customer service.","Excellent robust design.While you have to learn to hear its input, after your brain gets used to it, it really  helps. The battery life also seems longer than Brand X, which I have also owned. Gets quite flaky when the battery gets low, but you learn to recognize the symptoms. In short, this has got to be one of the best PSA's on the market. But if the Otofonix design group is listening, a more forward-directed microphone would be helpful. I have been using mine for a month or so, will comment here again after a longer trial.One month update: Working like a champ; better battery life from the p312 battery seems to be real. Try wearing it with your fingers in both ears to hear it alone when you want to compare modes!"
108,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,I realized that there are now cheaper alternatives that provide excellent solutions for individuals with moderate hearing loss,"have been wearing expensive hearing aids for 10+ years. I recently lost one and was agonizing about having to spend big bucks to have it replaced. Then I read an article in the New Yorker about hearing technology (4/3/17 by David Owen). I realized that there are now cheaper alternatives that provide excellent solutions for individuals with moderate hearing loss, like me. The article didn't specifically mention Otofonix, but I did some independent research and decided to give it a try. I am now 1-month into using Otofonix on both ears and I am a satisfied customer. These hearing amplifiers require more active adjustment than the programmed hearing aids, but that gives me more control. And the punchline is that I am paying one-fifth of the amount I would pay for a hearing aid."
108,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Good Product, Great Service","This hearing amplifier works well, and is much less expensive than a hearing aid.I had an issue come up with mine, and unfortunately it was just out of warranty. I was disappointed, and knew I could be SOL, but I thought I'd call them up and see if they would help — maybe give me a discount for a new one. I'm glad I called! The customer service representative was friendly and sympathetic. She offered to take care of the problem free of charge even though the company was under no obligation to do so.Ladies and gentlemen, these folks are doing it right. THIS IS HOW COMPANIES SHOULD TREAT THEIR CUSTOMERS!Thank you, Otofonix, for caring about more than the bottom line."
108,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,I'm satisfied,"They do not give me normal hearing, but I can hear better when I wear them. I have learned that the little plastic tube that leads from the hearing aid unit to my ear canal is easily twisted. When that happens, the hearing aid whistles. You need to realign the little red line on the tube with the line on the unit."
108,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This one works really well, easier to use and better than the in the ear canal types.","Great product. Works well. Better than the in the ear canal ones I have tried.4 settings and 2 dB settings up to 10 times with closed dome.I may buy another one later for other ear. Plus I have small ear drum perforation in both ears, surgery did not work.These are just as good for now. The other in the ear types I spent money on, will continue using in one ear and this new one in the other ear. In the ear canal types can hurt the inner ear if not used right, then it’s sore. This one has minimal discomfort. My eye glasses and hair hide the over the ear piece, hardly noticeable."
108,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing!,"I received mine yesterday and it works fantastic! I just purchased the left ear, as that is the one I am hard of hearing in. I have mild hearing loss, but in a big room, with lots of noise, I have a tough time hearing what people say. This worked immediately, right out of the box. It has 4 settings you can adjust. I previously tried Hearing Assist hearing aids, but every time I took it off, it lost it's programming and I had to reset it. Plus you had to charge it every night. I don't have to do that with this. I am very well satisfied. Try it! What have you got to lose?"
108,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,and was not happy with it,"I had just bought a $3000 hearing aid, and was not happy with it. I went back to the hearing place several times and once I paid for it, got minimal help. I went online and bought the otofonix for a whole lot less. When I first got it, it whistled and didn't work well. I called the help line, and the person told me to change to the longer tube, and the solid earpiece. The unit works perfect, much better than the expensive one. I can turn the sound up or down, is easy to clean, works for a week on one battery. The expensive unit is an ""ric"" model, and is constantly 'plugging up with wax. I know only wear the otofonix."
108,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,excellent product; excellent service,"I like this device - it works well.  For me, the toughest test was talkiing to a young woman with a high, soft voice in a room filled with people talking.  I heard everything, and not once needed to go 'Huh?  Would you please repeat.'Superb value.  Great price/performance.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I find it a bit fiddly, and I've needed often to refer back to the manual when things aren't behaving quite right.  The customer service is FANTASTIC, though, and I've always had my issues resolved.  This is my first hearing aid/PSA, however, so I can't compare this to others.This is clearly a company that goes out of their way to succeed."
108,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,These really are great,"I am so glad I read all the reviews on these as I am very hard of hearing and I was concerned these would not work as well at my $8,000.00 hearing aids that finally wore out after warranty.  I could not be happier with paying this price and giving up the minor advantages the expensive ones had,  These do not ""talk"" to each other and are totally separate, but because of the number of extras included, I was able to make adjustments to fit my ears and my hearing needs.  I am so happy to find a reasonably priced alternative to paying another $8,000.00 for new hearing aids that insurance won't cover.I have adjusted to the smallest closed ear tips to eliminate the little bit of whistling I first heard when I turned these up as high as they go and now I can also adjust for 3 different settings for normal, noisy and power and the videos on their website helped to make these adjustments.  Will not need to go back to the expensive aids again."
108,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Worth a try,"I tried this device in lieu of a hearing aid. The company told me that they understood that not everyone could use this device and they offered a money back guarantee which they honored. The ear that I bought it for was a little too far gone for it to work successfully. It does amplify with four different settings for different conditions but since my hearing was so poor, the different options just amplified a murky noise. I called their tech staff and they were very helpful and offered a lot of things to try including the different tips that came with it. It is definitely worth a try before you buy an expensive hearing aid."
108,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,worth the money,"This little Hearing Amplifier is doing everything I hoped it would.  My husband usually goes to bed much earlier than I do, I prefer to watch TV and the 10 o'clock news.  I'm almost 68 years old and my hearing isn't what it once was and when I would turn the TV up so I could hear it, my husband would complain.  I purchased a much less expensive unit that worked well .. for about a month .. then it started making such a racket it was louder than my Tinnitus !!  I purchased one little Otofonix for my left ear and I am so glad I did !!  I've only used it a couple of weeks, so I can't speak to its durability, but I can say it's well worth the price.  It was easy to set up and works beautifully.  The TV is loud and clear and my husband never hears it .. mission accomplished.  I even forget I have it on when I answer the phone .. and I can hear the caller clearly."
108,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Worked well, but I'm not sure about longevity.","The Otofonix Elite I bought worked really well, and helped quite a bit,but only for 23 days.Despite following the instructions explicitly, the unit I bought quit working completely.They have a generous trial period and returns aren't a problem ,but I couldn't see getting a replacement when mine quit working so soon.Suddenly failed to turn on even with new battery installed.I can't imagine having to spend again for purchase a new one after the 45 day trial, or paying to return it for repairs with it being gone for a few weeks."
108,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,I like this amplifier and there's more pros than cons,"I like this amplifier and there's more pros than cons. It has definitely improved my hearing. But for no reason it will start leaving high-pitched squeals, sometimes several in a row. I can't find out the reason why. Sometimes I'm sitting on the couch and it starts. Nothing has change like my position or the noise level. I have to take it out for a while because those squeals hurt. It happens in the car when traveling. The amplifier does this at least every other day and it's not the battery and it's not dirty. I tried calling the Company but got a busy signal all day long and I gave up. I still like the instrument because it has improved my hearing."
108,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Works great but doesn't last,"The Good: For me they worked great. Actually changed my life after dealing with moderate hearing loss for years. Could hear in meetings again.The Bad: There appears to be a design flaw. The ""ring"" on the device where the ear tube attaches is extremely fragile. When this breaks  the unit becomes useless since the sound tube will not stay attached.  I sent both of mine back for replacement while still under warranty.  Unfortunately this has happened again and now the warranty has expired.Bottom line is the product performed well but is not durable"
108,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Makes better sense than an expensive hearing aid,"My problem is with background noise, like some restaurants, bars, or amusement parks.  I haven’t had the opportunity to make real use of it yet, but I did a test run in a Mall of America food court, and it really did help.  I think 3 1/2 stars would be more accurate.  The only problem I’ve had is the first battery died too quickly when I accidentally left it closed for too long.  You must leave it open when not it use to save the battery."
108,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very glad I did,"I have moderate hearing loss in my left ear.  In conversations I found myself asking people to repeat themselves more and more over time.  Hearing aids were just too expensive, but something had to be done.  I decided to take a chance on a Personal Sound Amplifier.  Did a fair bit of research, and decided on the Otofonix, based on features and flexibility.  Very glad I did.  My wife and kids have noticed a huge difference; I rarely say ""sorry - what did you say?"", which used to be part of my standard vocabulary.I will also mention that I am a musician and singer.  Not only do I now hear musical nuances I couldn't before, but everything is more distinct in live sessions and I can hear my own voice better.  Quite a confidence builder!I have the Otofonix dialed in to my preferred volume and sound profile for most situations, but changing it ""on the fly"" is simple and intuitive.Highly recommended."
108,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect,Thank you for the great service on the hearing aids. I got them in a timely manner and I needed them.Amazon does a wonderful job - not only in product value and price but also getting the product delivered.
108,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Too small for my fingers,"I could not manipulate the volume and mode buttons with the aid in place on my ear.  The controls are so small that with my fingers they could not be felt. While holding the aid in my hand, it was easy to manipulate the rocker button but that left no way of knowing what the setting it was on until I put it back in the ear.  This became quite frustrating and being  my first experience with a  hearing aid, I was at a loss as what to do so it was returned.  Small is good, but too small is bad.  Still looking for a usable hearing aid.  Hope there is something out there."
108,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,The price is certainly better than models costing 10 times as much,The price is certainly better than models costing 10 times as much.  After getting used to it I have come to like it somewhat.  I will buy another one like this when the time is right.  The only drawback is that the sound tube connection works its way loose and tends to move when putting the hearing aid in/out.  You just have to check it to make sure the red line up marks are in line.  I recommend giving it a try.  It’s better  than a year of monthly payments on an aid that costs thousands more.  Hopefully they will have models soon that you can program via bluetooth that are more affordable.  I really need a model with EQ control.
108,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,WAY MORE COST EFFECTIVE THAN HEARING AIDS,"I replaced a failing $4k pair of hearing aids with this product, and could not be happier. The hearing aids lasted about 5 years, and are now kaput. I also found that maintenance on them was quite expensive, and my investment in them was well over $5k overall.These  Otofonix amplifiers have performed as well as the hearing aids ever did, and their Customer Service has been excellent. I had some concerns about cosmetics, but my wife is quite happy that they are fundamentally invisible, even though they are an external fit device.  The technology will get better over time, and I'm glad that the investment in these is such that I can afford to buy the ""new and improved"" versions if I choose, and it will not be the very substantial price decision that conventional hearing aids would be. If they only last a year or two, I'm still thousands ahead over five years.I'm enjoying very effective hearing enhancement at an affordable price,  with the ability to upgrade  the devices when change is necessary, or I decide to upgrade."
108,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Very comfortable, discreet and works!",I have Meniere's disease and as a result suffer from hearing loss and tinnitus in my left ear. Because my level of hearing loss fluctuates my audiologist has said that I am not a good candidate for hearing aids. I have heard good things about hearing amplifiers and thought I'd give them a try. This amplifier literally took less than 2 minutes to put the battery in and put on and I could hear out of my ear clearly for the first time in years! The tinnitus was diminished and I could clearly hear my son speaking to me. It's barely noticeable even with my hair pulled back in a ponytail & extremely comfortable.
108,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Update!!: WAS the best....Best set yet for tinnitus/noise cancellation/mild hearing loss,These are the best ones I have used yet. I use them because of severe tinnitus that has led to hearing loss. I'm not ready for hearing aids yet so I tried these. I actually wear them daily. Wish the battery life was longer but the different volumes and settings make it easy to set them where you want and you dont have to reset when you change batteries. Love them.Update: 12.31.28- I literally took them out to dry my hair and the right one just stopped working out of nowhere. The battery was acting like it didn't want to click back in? I've tried every troubleshooting method I can and cannot get it to work!
108,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,It Works!,"Over the past 10 years I've used the expensive versions from two different top rated suppliers, spending nearly $10,000.  I lost the right ear (second time, so replacement would cost over $2000), and replaced with the Otofonix as a test.  I have borderline (56db) ""moderately severe"" hearing loss in this ear, and worse (70db) for my left ear.  I've been wearing the Otofonix daily for 3 weeks, and find it as good as my previous high end models at pulling voices out of background noise, and for general use such as listening to the news at normal volume levels, or attending theater.  I did find that if I turned up amplification too high, there was feedback, so had to find my own sweet spot.  Also, battery life was low until I figured out that the battery ""door"" has to be rotated completely out or it will continue to drain.  I continue to use the high end model in my left ear, but would not hesitate to replace it with another Otofonix should it fail or be lost."
108,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Pretty good,This product compared to $4K  $5K products that I have tried is very good. I work in manufacturing so hearing aids just make all noise louder and most people can't hear in that environment anyways.In a meeting though this product does kick up the volume as I need it and it helps me stay tuned in to what is being said. It  has four different types of sound improvement as well as volume increases. Also helps with my Tinnitus in one ear.Would have given it 4 stars but the battery life is not as good as the specs.Would recommend you try this product.
108,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best bang for the buck!,"I have had the hearing amplifier for about 8 months. During that time I have worn it regularly. Previously I had a fancy, Bluetooth equipped $2500 model from my audiologist, but I wore it in hot weather when I was hiking and sweating and a couple of times (briefly) in the shower and it didn’t work anymore because of my carelessness. I bought this one as a replacement for the expensive model hoping that it would be a worthy substitute. This unit doesn’t have Bluetooth or any bells and whistles, but it actually works really well. The sound quality is almost as good as the expensive one. I hear the tv much better and I am able to participate in conversations with confidence. I cannot tell much difference in the different hearing modes, but it works well enough that I would definitely recommend it to others and I would also buy it again for myself. In addition the customer service is absolutely outstanding. It is the best bang for the buck that I have found!"
108,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Better than Expected,"I'm a professional musician and my research indicates that there just isn't any hearing aid that is appropriate for the frequencies in music.  If they were available, I'd spend whatever is necessary to be able to hear music accurately.  That being said, I do need hearing aids for speech, so I decided that rather than spend thousands of dollars, I'd try the Otofonix hearing aid.  I bought just one as a trial, and I'm quite pleased with it.  The instructions are clear.  I was using it with success within minutes of unpacking it.  After about 10 days of using it for television, conversations at the dinner table, and other social situations, I have ordered a second unit.  I had no difficulty getting used to it. I found the settings to be helpful. I frequently forget that I am actually wearing it.  I have tried hearing aids set up by an audiologist, but I did not purchase them because they were unusable for music.  These non-prescription ""hearing amplifiers"" for far less money will work fine for my purpose."
108,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Skeptic turned believer!,"I can't hear in rooms with high ceilings and lots of people talking anymore. It was affecting me professionally. I've heard the usual horror stories from friends who got expensive hearing aids that didn't help, so I thought I would try the Otofonix Elite Hearing Amplifier to see if it was possible to change my hearing before investing thousands of dollars. I was also worried about it staying on because I wear glasses. It was amazing to try it on for the first time. The programming is easy to set and it stayed put behind my ear with no problems but best of all I could hear! I didn't expect it to make much of a difference and the difference is huge. It was a shock to attend a conference recently and realize how much I had been missing. Only bought for one ear ( I was very skeptical!) and now am going to buy one for the other ear. It may not work for everyone but it was magical for me.Now I'm kicking myself for holding out on buying these immediately."

123,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Better than the Audiologist or Costco,"I bought these hearing aids for my 97-year-old grandfather and he loves them! They are super easy to use and have excellent sound quality. He had done a hearing test with his doctor and was able to upload it to the Blaids app easily. For fine tuning we just submit a remote fitting request and the Blaids specialist team sent the adjustments remotely! Much more convenient than going to the audiologist. The app is very advanced, it offers all the same EQ adjustments as an audiologist would make. The customer support people are fantastic, when we call we get a REAL, US-based person right away. No holding or talking to machines. It’s so refreshing to work with a company that really cares about their customers! For what you pay there is no better device on the market! I would even say these are far better than what we tried from the audiologist for $6,000."
123,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great hearing aids!,"I have severe hearing loss in my left ear, so only purchased for one ear. I am also new to this, my hearing loss occurred in July '23. It does take some time to get used to (for me), but the app the company uses (AcoSound) is easy to use. Take the time to read through the instructions and the app. I had my best success with using Pro Fitting AFTER entering in my most recent actual audio test to the app. The company also has 24/7 support, and you should check out their main website as well.They are comfortable for all day wear, I am pretty active and have had no issue with it becoming dislodged or uncomfortable. I would recommend trying out the inner ear caps to make sure you get exactly the right one to prevent feedback. Another plus is I haven't had to change the battery as much as predicted, and I wear it about 10-12 hours a day."
123,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Better than my $3,000 True Hearing old set","I'm a senior Quality Engineer for Rolls Royce.  These were turned on and set to my needs in about 20 minutes.  My old pair from True Hearing that were custom made in ear models had a bad replication of my voice.  These have a minute amount of this.  They have a nice, advanced adjustment to help with soft voices.  From day one they didn't hurt my ear due to shape.  The sound was close to twice better than my expensive set.  One downside is it didn't come with not one single battery.  I had to make a trip to just get them started.  It made initially feel the company was cheap.  The product performance won me back over to liking them."
123,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,,Me ubico Austin de Blaids x Micro y me soluciono todas las inconformidades. Absolutamente recomendable
123,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,The best I've used,"Best hearing aids I've used and that includes a set that cost over $3,000.  These hearing aids are very small and fit in the ear canal very well.  They're kind of a flesh color (Caucasian) and are hardly noticeable.  The hearing aids are powered by batteries.  They use 312 batteries, one per hearing aid, and a package of six are included with the kit.  Also included are various sizes/styles of dome for a custom fit.  A small number of cleaning supplies are also in the kit.  The hearing aids are controlled through the use of a free downloadable app, AcoSound, available for both IOS and Android.  I downloaded the app to my rather ancient Android phone, took the included hearing test and then customized both hearing aids.  The download went very smoothly only took one try and it loaded perfectly.  The hearing test was easy to complete and the customization process went well.  No problems.  It is important to know that you must use the app to control the hearing aids.  There are no ""on-board"" type controls for the hearing aids.  There's a trade off involved - in order to keep the hearing aids small they can't have rechargeable batteries and, as I mentioned before, there are no on-board controls; you must use the app.  These are the smallest hearings I've seen and I'm okay with having to use & purchase batteries and to have to use the app.  The hearing aids do remember your settings so you don't have to reprogram each time you use the hearing aids but if you want to change anything, including the volume setting, you have to use the app.  I'm currently having a little trouble getting the app to recognize both of the hearing aids but I think the problem is with my phone, I'm sure I'll get it straightened out and if not there's a help line to resolve any problems.  In summary, I'm extremely happy with these hearing aids.  I wish they had rechargeable batteries and on-board controls but I understand why they don't and I'm willing to accept the limitations.  Highly recommended.  Oh, and my wife is real happy that I'm wearing 'em.  No more full volume TV."
123,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Incredible audio quality,"I have been using prescription hearing aids for about 25 years with the last five using OTC because of cost and trips to the audiologist.I've had some that come close to the audio quality of my prescription set but this set has set the new standard. What I think does it is these have 48 DSP channels where others have 16 and these are completely in canal (CIC) which makes them almost invisible to see and gives better sound quality.When I saw the batteries, I was shocked. This may be a turn off for some people but I used to pay $20.00 for a pack of 6. Now on Amazon I get 80 for that price, so using batteries now isn't too bad.They have a bobtail so you can pull them out of your ears.The app works well with these hearing aids and the hearing test was perfect.I wanted to take off a star because they aren't rechargeable, but how could I with audio quality this good."
123,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,High Quality Hearing Aids!,"I am a huge fan of these hearing aids as they are of a very high quality! They are quite small, which I really like, are easy to install and remove from one's ears. They work extremely well at amplifying sound, which is the most important thing to me, as well as them being very comfortable! I absolutely love these and I give them a very high recommendation!"

148,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Highly recommend!,I have had the most expensive hearing aids and never quite like them too much noise in and out of the doctors office for them to fix them and nothing ever helped. I seen these on Amazon and said I’m going to try them. I’m in love they fit perfect in my ears noise canceling. I don’t hear myself talk thank you paid over $9000 for my original hearing aids and these from Amazon  under $150. absolutely work thank you! I already started recommending to friends thank you again!
148,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not hearing aids. Just sound amplifying,Just amplifies  everything.  Like I can hear the sound of someone walking on sand.  I wanted to be able to hear conversation.  They actually made hearing worse. I planned to return them but someone threw the box away so I had to keep them.  Don't waste your time or money.
148,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,waste of money,Not worth the money  picks up too much background noise  info says noise cancelling  too tifficult to adjust must be adjusted every time i put then on depending on backgournd
148,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Like the way they fit,"Just recently received these but so far, I like what I see.They fit nicely and have good sound quality.I would recommend them."
148,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Volume control breaks my finger nails,"I give it one star. Extremely difficult to use volume control.  Trying to get use to it.  Since the performance is lacking, I’m using them to get use to having something in my ears.  Maybe someday I can afford real hearing aids."
148,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,I have found my hearing again,"These aids are very comfortable and work great , I tried these for the first time today , and heard sounds that I havent heard in a long time ...and the best part , my wife didn't have to repeat herself"

23,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,,"Muy triste porque mi abuela estaba muy ansiosa por recibir los audífonos y poder escuchar de nuevo, se tardó el pedido y ahora tengo que esperar el reembolso."
23,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product!!,These are well worth the money!! The company was amazing when one of them didnt work. They sent me a whole new pair no questions asked.
23,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These aids are comfortable, easy to operate and are a great value.",I like the lithium ion battery that charges in its own case.  The sound is great too.
23,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wonderful,I like how long I can wear the hearing aids  day and night without recharging.
23,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product for the price,I really like my new hearing aids! I like also that they Bluetooth capability!

23,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not clear,Sound was not good
23,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not for any kind of significant hearing loss,It wasn't what I needed for my loss of hearing

23,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Problem getting refund,Inferior item.  Returned item but have still not received refund
23,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Lucid a low-tech hearing aid,"I bought Lucid hearing aids at Sams for $3000, ($500 of that for insurance lost & damage) These need to be order for android or apple so if you change phones from Apple to Samsung you will be out of luck. While other companies will work with either phone, Lucid is so low-tech one of the only companies that its one or the other. Imagine if you had to order your car to work with Apple or Android. Lucid customer service is the horrible, I now needed one that work for android, and they send apple comparable since that is what I had 3 years ago, regardless that I paid the insurance and $400 deductible total of $900 for the second pair. These Lucid hearing aids pick up unnecessary background noise making the human voice still hard to hear someone. Now I am able to go and have these adjustments made at Sams, if you buy OTC, you will be on your own. I went in today and the tech hooks the Lucid hearing aids to a computer to try to get the background noise out and turn the sound up for human voice and I start to hear what I am saying back in my ear as an echo and unreasonably loud, so the tech adjusts them lower, and I can hear not much better wearing them. Maybe on Amazon you can return them, I was going to buy them on Amazon when a friend that wears them say that hearing aids have to be fitted so I went to Sams that sells Lucid and purchased them and had nothing but problems and still they don't improve my hearing enough to even use them and this has been going on for three years now on my second pair that I can't adjust the volume using the phone, or answer a phone call using the hearing aid. I can't adjust for wind and background noise with the Lucid phone App. Lucid does not make a remote to adjust them if you don't own a smart phone. But why would anyone want to buy from a company with such poor customer service, I was on the phone with Lucid after they came in as Apple and the associate said she talked to the Lucid rep., and he would do nothing. I even called the Lucid rep. since I wasn't going to pick them up from the store until they could change them to Android, and this went on for a month. The Sams associate said she could refund the $400 deductible, but I paid $500 for Insurance that I would be out so I said I would give them a try since they could be better than the first pair that I lost and if they worked, I would not be taking them out of my ears and wouldn't lose them. But they don't work any better and I went to the Amazon site to see what hearing aids they are selling, and I see they are selling the sub-standard Lucid hearing aid. Save your money don't buy Lucid or they also are sold under the Liberty name.  Lucid has very poor customer service, Lucid basically gave me the double middle finger."
23,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,These are Junk don't waste money!,"I bought these at Sam's.  Paid $1,600.00. Got no help from sales  person."
23,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Worked well until they broke and no service,They worked well when they weren’t broken but the Bluetooth connection can be described as abysmal. The app also sucks and you have to reconnect constantly which is a dealbreaker. Biggest issue was one of the hearing aids stopped working and I was just outside of their short warranty period and the only customer service they offered was to rebuy a new set. Can’t recommend these hearing aids or this company
23,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Hearing Aid System for both Ears with Smartphone APP interface option,"The first two features I noticed of the LUCID HEARING ENGAGE- RECHARGEABLE HEARING AIDS is the smooth fit in ear and very minimal squeal during insertion. These are the most comfortable and best fitting over the ear Hearing Aids ( amplifiers ) personally tried. They are discrete in my opinion. I don’t like that the kit does not have the AC Power Charger Module. Part# LA-EGBTE1-A-GR (Ean 0812944027391)- ANDROID COMPATIBLE -The Review system received is Android version. Admittedly I did not see the distinction between Android and IOS. I downloaded the IOS APP but it will not recognize the devices.Each system includes: Hearing Aids (2), USB charge cable, Rechargeable case w/ internal batteries, Wax stops plus a variety of S-M-L Solid and Vented Domes.  The units were received partially charged but I placed immediately on charge.  Within an hour both lights were solid green indicating Full Charge. With a cursory look at the control function I placed them on my ears.The Hearing Aids can be controlled and used without any manufacturer APP. The “ rocker type “ switch control is DUAL FUNCTION. Hold the switch for long moment UP or DOWN to change to one of the available four programs. A quick PRESS UP/DOWN changes volume. With the long PRESS to change programs a VOICE CONFIRMATION is received of the program selected.  These are Mild, Moderate, Bass Boost and Max. The control is easy for my stubby man hands to find and use while the device is on the ear. When the Hearing Aids are placed into the charging cradle they are automatically turned off.  Turn on- when removed.Fitting for me…. Worked out of the box. I am using the AIDS as received. The DOME smoothly slide into my ear and has been a comfortable fit. There was minor ( barely could be heard ) feedback ( squeal ) when installing in the ear.  As these stay in my ear I have experienced no squeal instances of the domes slipping out of the ear.Test….. has been in noisy restaurant, normal television, movie on television, news and normal household daily use.  In a word….. Excellent!  Recommended  Five  ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️  StarThank you for looking at my review.  If you found this review valuable please click on the Helpful Icon. Thanks 😊"
23,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Horrible service,I like the Engage rechargeable hearing aids from Lucid. I lost my right hearing aid and an email rep said to CALL Lucid to order a new one. No rep answered after 3 calls and 20 minutes of waiting. Pathetic. A good product with ZERO support and no online ordering.
23,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Very nice,"This hearing aid is pretty neat. It comes with a variety of solid and vented ear tips in different sizes so you can find what works best for you. It seems to be along the lines of modern earbuds in that they sync to your mobile phone via bluetooth, and there is an app that is used to control the settings on them and change the behavior. One of the things that I really am not crazy about is that these hearing aids are tied to a particular mobile OS, so they have an Android model and an iOS (iphone) model. I don't understand why they can't just work on both, so if you decide to switch phones then you would have to get a different hearing aid. One interesting observation, if you go look on the google play store at the lucid hearing app, it has pretty bad reviews right now, but on the iOS app store the lucid hearing app has much better reviews. I'd be curious to do a side by side comparison but can't.Anyway I have tried these with one of my android devices, had no problem syncing them and controlling all the various settings. I find these hearing aids to be comfortable and very helpful."
23,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best OTC hearing aid available,"I did not expect to use these except for social events. I now wear them all the time. I didn’t realize what I had been missing with bad hearing! I now see that I was ignoring what little sound registered in my brain because it conveyed less and less helpful info. I can see how this could push you down the slippery slope to senility.  The noise reduction is excellent, I can be in a noisy place and understand conversations all around me. I can drive with the window open listening to the car radio with less annoyance than when I was young with good hearing.  I can go to a bar and play a YouTube video and still hear conversations or change the settings to ignore the idiots.  Downside:  You have to understand the limitations of Bluetooth connections stay the same as with your earbuds, it’s not the hearing aids fault.  You have to be moderately functional with tech stuff. But.. you don’t need to use Bluetooth as a crutch for bad hearing as much as you did before.  This was the best investment I have made in a long time. It has changed the way my brain works and the way I interact with the world. Update 1 1/2 years later. I used to have awful, loud squealing tinnitus 24/7. I rarely notice now and only after not wearing the hearing aid for a while. It has made me hear or listen better so that I don’t say huh? all the time, even when I don’t have them on. I shorted out one pair with wet ears. They promptly replaced them for free. My charger broke. My fault. They replaced it free."
23,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Buyer Beware of OTC Hearing Aids and Amazon's Refund Policies on OTC Hearing Aids,"I bought the Lucid Engage OTC hearing aids after doing some research and also on the recommendation of a friend who uses them. I tried for three weeks and numerous phone calls to Lucid to get them to work properly. They would not hold the settings, which I think may be either/or hardware or app related. My final test was they day of a business lunch. I had dialed in and saved the settings per my instructions from Lucid technical support. To my disappointment the whole business lunch meeting was terrible. The Lucid aids actually amplified background noise, made the setting very uncomfortable and they didn't improve my ability to hear conversation from a client directly across from me.My lesson learned and advice for anyone needing hearing assistance. You can spend more time and effort searching for the right OTC hearing aid. In the end you can't really know how good the hardware quality is  and how well they will work for you. Like eyeglasses, you can order them online, but even with eyeglasses you need a professional to give you an eye exam and get the correct prescription before you can order glasses. The online hearing tests are vague and don't really tell you what your hearing loss is and therefore what device and adjustment will make them work best for you. I would also say there are many, many companies selling  inexpensive hearing devices from $200 to $1,500 that are questionable as to what they really will do.My advice is if you think you have hearing loss go to a professional and have your hearing assessed, then decide how you will address it. Costco is a good place to start as they will give you a no charge hearing test and they sell some reasonably priced brand name hearing aids.If you have insurance that covers hearing tests and hearing aids, by all means take advantage of your insurance benefit.Further on Amazon as relates to this transaction. BEWARE!. I have been prime member for years and make about 70 to 120 purchases per year. Returned items and refunds have always been handled in 3-5 days. NOT SO WITH OTC HEARING AIDS!!!I have been told at least 4 times my refund would come in 3-5 days, then I was told a refund takes up to 2 weeks, after two weeks I was assured I would have my refund in 3-5 days. I have an email stating a refund can take two weeks. My last phone call to Amazon was on 12/09/22, and I was now told a refund would take 30 days. I was also told there was nothing they or their supervisors could do as it was being automatically generated in their computer system. I will say this, Amazon customer service reps are very friendly and creative in the stories they make up as they go along. It is now 3 weeks, and as I told them I would file a dispute with with credit card company (which I did). AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED AMAZON GETS NO STARS AND ONE BLACK EYE FOR THIS ONE.SUMMARY: BUYER BEWARE OF OTC HEARING AIDS, AND BE DOUBLY AWARE OF PRUCHASING THEM THROUGH AMAZON. DON""T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY WITH OTC HEARING AIDS, IN MY EXPERIENCE, YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR AND THEY ARE MOSTLY JUNK."
23,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very pleasantly pleased,I read all the reviews and was concerned about purchasing this device. I so happy I bought them. I thought the setup was easy but I got frustrated that the device would not stay connected. I Googled this issue and realized I needed to setup the device. I have included a picture of the installation needed for iPhone. This installation resolved all my issues. I love my purchase!Update: charge the case separate from the hearing for a better charge.
23,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Frustrated,"UPDATED: I've reduced my 4 star review to 3. Here is why:These are good ""hearing aids"". However, the important feature I needed when researching OTC hearings aids was the ability to connect to Bluetooth devices, specifically, my iPhone. These connected for a while... maybe two months. But then they started to lose Bluetooth connectivity. It started with sound dropping out unexpectedly from one ear. Now, there is no iPhone connectivity at all. All I can do with them is use them as standard hearing aids. That would have been fine if that was all I was looking for.Extremely frustrated.Think this is a good product. I have a few issues. Every day the volume level seems to reset to level 5. Also, love the ability to LUCID to program for your specific hearing levels and SAVE to overwrite the defaults. Sometimes it loses those settings and I don’t know where it is saved to. Have to reprogram my settings. I did a screenshot so I have something to refer to."
23,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Lucid's android app makes this product unusable.,"I don't write reviews, but after paying this much for a product with such poorly written software I am massively frustrated.If you have an android phone, this is one of the only hearing aids that supports it. I understand the way android handles bluetooth audio makes certain features impossible, however, the Lucid app is beyond broken. It will constantly switch between the hearing aid 'program' and streaming 'program' unless you connect a 2nd BT device to stop it. You will have to do this otherwise you will not be able to adjust the EQ settings for the hearing aids. If you manage that, it still won't matter, as sometimes one hearing aid will decide your EQ settings are wrong and change them. You can change them back, save them again and hope but it'll probably revert back again. In my case, this results in having a mechanical form of tinnitus in my ear as it boosts the treble regions which I do not need, or worse, causes massive feedback inside of my ear.This is on top of having terrible bluetooth range and connection stability. Requiring you to make an account to even use their android app. Or the fact that the volume settings never save and will default to 7/10 whenever you reconnect the hearing aids.I'm returning these for a refund. Sound wise, these are wonderfully clear, when they work. So it's a real shame that hearing loss is less of an annoyance than interacting with Lucid's android app."
23,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great aids, but they won't stream with Motorola phones (and others)!","These aids are the real deal, they are pre-programmed with typical hearing-loss scenarios, but my loss is not typical!  The good news, though, is by using the app I can program each aid to compensate for my unusual hearing loss profile.  So, the hearing profile is programmable if you know what you are doing.  The app works great on my Motorola Android phone, but guess what:  the Moto phones are NOT compatible with the so called ASHA (Audio Streaming for Hearing Aids) standard.  So, while the app itself works great in controlling the aids, the app WILL NOT stream any audio from the Motorola phone, that means no ""Bluetooth calling"" or any streaming of music.  I found this out by talking to the helpful support person at Lucid.  Now, I either have to send these back, and/or change my phone (which I just bought!) to another brand which is ASHA compatible.EDIT:  I ended up returning these (I am a Prime member), and I had absolutely no issue with the return, unlike one 1-star reviewer.  These are quality hearing aids, and I would have kept them if they had been able to stream on my Motorola phone!"
23,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,Stopped working,"They work decent for the price , tuning isn’t as good as I’d like , 1 side went out 6 months after purchase, Amazon won’t exchange them so now they just sit on my desk and I’m out $700"
23,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Battery lasts all day with bluetooth streaming,"I love these hearing aids & happy I can listen to music at work wearing them. Love going cordless!  The battery lasts all day, even when using Bluetooth streaming. My regular blue tooth earbuds only lasted 4 hours while streaming. One problem is that the sound quality is not always good, but sometimes it is. I think this is more about where you are located, the atmospherics, etc.  I highly recommend these even if the sound quality is not perfect every time. Most of the time the sound is excellent."
23,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Customer support a problem,"I bought these hearing aids, when they delivered I put them on to charge right out of the box. I waited until they were completely charged before trying to use them. The left hearing aid was 100% but the right was only 3/4%. During the course of the day the right died faster then the left. I would try recharging them in the case, the left aid would charge to 100% but the right would only charge maybe a 1/4 of the way so it took multiple attempts at charging it to get it close to 100%. I reach out to the saller through Amazon; the saller response was to call customer support. I tried messaging customer support and never got a reply, I’m not even sure the messages were delivered. I also tried calling customer support and waited on hold until the phone disconnected on their end; I was on hold for nearly an hour. The next day I made several attempts to call that went unanswered so I left a voicemail. They returned my call at that point, I told the tech my problem and the told me to try charging the aids without plugging in the charging cord to the case; I have been charging them this way the whole time since the charger is supposed to charge without being plugged in. Being a general mechanic I work on equipment that uses batteries as well as electricity and know when a battery is bad, the right hearing aid’s battery was not good and needed to be replaced. Even after trying to charge the aid just like they said it still wouldn’t take a complete charge. Trying to get in touch with support takes much effort than I have time for and their solution to this problem didn’t work. $800 is a lot of money to pay for something to have problems right out of the box and not to get a resolution to the problem within a reasonable amount of time so I sent them back asking for a refund."
23,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Does its job,"I was planning to spend $2100 on one hearing aid for my left ear heart no loss, and was thrilled to find this less expensive option. This aid does assist my hearing, and I appreciate the Bluetooth and charging case.However, I was greatly disappointed to receive the hearing aids without a charging cable. When I contacted support, I was told it doesn’t come with a cable, even though it’s listed on the “what’s included” page of the instruction manual. You’d think an $800 device could include a $10 charger.The Bluetooth is convenient when it works, but it loses connection frequently; my $20 generic earbuds do a better job.But if all you need is something to help you hear, these are a great option."
23,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Really like them,"I am not new to hearing aids, but this is the first OTC pair I have bought.  They stream phone calls and audio via Bluetooth and stream to both ears.  The app is easy to use and lets you fine tune to your hearing.  Sound quality is good.  Love that the charging case charges as well as the aids themselves.  Makes it easy to charge on the go.  Only thing I would have liked to see with these is a hearing test in the app to help with fine tuning each program for your specific hearing needs.  Overall great little hearing aids that I would highly recommend."
23,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,After 3 years..,"After 3 years of flawless daily use and probably 400 + hrs of watching movies and listening to music via the bluetooth. I bought a second pair to use daily and my older,trusty pair i sat aside so i have a "" back up"" pair. I cant say enough about what a great deal these hearing aids are."
23,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Satisfactory,"These are pretty nice for the price. On occasion, one may die early, but generally, the charge lasts a full day. I tried using the app to set them up, but it seems that if you go out of range, they revert to their power-up state. So I just use them manually. There are 4 'programs' built in and the Moderate setting does me just fine."
23,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love them!,"I have purchased hearing aids for thousands of dollars years ago. I have to admit that these are the closest I found to them.  The are not amplifiers but give a good balance.  Also, the iPhone app is great because I was used to that with my expensive aids.  This is a good purchase.  So far so good!"
23,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,I can hear again!,"As soon as I took my evening walk with my dog, I could hear the crickets,  the water running in the creek, and the leaves rustling in the woods among others nature sounds that I had forgotten about.  They also work well when my wife talks, and even in a group setting in a restaurant.They only wish is that the speaker was a little smaller, as it is taking a while to get use to these being in my ear."
23,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Could not sync to my phone, terrible support","My android phone was unable to see the hearing aids, no matter what I tried - airplane mode and back, reboots, tried an older phone, power cycling the hearing aids through disconnection of the battery, all to no avail.They work, technically, as-is, but are functionally useless as they cannot be adjusted and the volume rockers don't seem to change anything.I tried to reach their support multiple times; the chat feature is worthless, no one ever comes on, and when I tried the phone no one ever picked up the call from hold and it eventually hung itself up.Do not recommend."
23,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Very nice sound,Very nice hearing aids. The sound quality is good.  I like that they are Bluetooth compatible with my android.  I did have to up grade my phone though.  I have a 9 operating system and it requires a 10 minimum.  I called customer service and a very helpful representative was able to tell me which phones were compatible. I was disappointed that the app to adjust the hearing aids wouldn't download.  Otherwise a great product
23,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,The right unit never worked.,i wrote to the company and never heard back.  This is the first time I noticed there is a place to complain. I would like a replacement ordere
23,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,#TEAMANDROID,I'm really disappointed because I needed to get the hearing aid program and when I finally found a place to do it I'm told its not compatible.  I ordered for a android and I was sent for an iPhone. had no idea till we couldn't connect to my phone! now it's too late to return.
23,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Batteries don’t last long,The batteries do not last longThe charge does not last longNot worth the price
23,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,fades in and out,both the hearing and Bluetooth fades in and out but when working they are great
23,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Lucidshape app and OTE hearing aids,The lucidshape app enables user to program the hearing aids for your specific hearing frequency deficiency. They are awesome!I was able to set them up better then the past audiologists ever did in the past. Also there customer support is staffed by experts in the U.S. who take the time to LISTEN to customer issues. Louis is a great support person. Thanks Lucid for providing a cost effective solution to my hearing loss.
23,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not worse the money,Got them and 6 month into it and the right went dead tried to get tech support but with no avail not recommend them.
23,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good hearing aids,"Light weight forgot that I was wearing these and got into the shower! They have Incredible sound quality!  compared these to a $6,000 pair which you can program on deflaut the lucid engage have to manually but for differents in price clear sound you can't beat these lucid engage aids 3 months now daily use and haven't had any problems. Just a little bit with app issue but was quickly resolved by the tech who was very nice to work with never had to wait on calls, also bluetooth music phone calls works great.I'll update in couple months"
23,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,No customer service,"This is not a blue tooth hearing aid combo, the application does not have the controls promised in the description, very poor app design.Customer service never answer the phone, and they never call back.I use it as a regular hearing aid, I like the rechargeable battery feature, and battery life, do not expect anything else."
23,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Plain old junk,"After returning a pair because of major feedback, and yes like others here it took WEEKS to get my refund I purchased these. At firs I was on the fence as for their performance, but now I can attest they are junk undoubtedly  manufactured far from American shores. The charger was glitchy in that sometimes it worked and other times it would not. I contacted Lucid and they promised a replacement 2-day shipping. That was over a week ago. I have not received a replacement. This morning the right aid took a dump. The volume control would not work. The early OTC hearing aid rule is failing badly in it's early stage. Spend the extra money and purchase a reputable hearing aid. I sent them back to Amazon. Let's see how long it takes to get a refund this time."
23,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good value and quality,"Extremely comfortable, great charging  with auto shut off, ability to turn off so not to drain charge between charges. Very good hearing aid, unfortunately, I have severe hearing loss and I need something more. I have tried several aids, from several thousand dollars. This is well thought out and should work great for mild to moderate hearing loss."
23,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Second attempt worse than the first,"I sent one set of these back because one channel would not connect. Engage tech support advised me to return them. Because of the failure to connect, I never got to the app.Bottom line: The app is [rhymes with ""app""].I have one of the phones listed for compatibility. The issue might be with Android 12. In any event, without a working app these things are utterly useless. Nevertheless I did try them and the result was unacceptable. Background noise like my dishwasher or A/C was far more prominent than sounds coming from my A/V receiver in spite of the fact that the receiver was louder and far closer.BTW, tech support is handled by Sam's Club. I suspect that Lucid licensed the Engage aids to Walmart. If you try the app in demo mode it is completely different than when connected to the Engage aids. The menus and choices are entirely different.Call me a cynic but I have some serious misgivings about the validity of ratings and reviews for this product."
23,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,DOESN’T HOLD CHARGE ! DON’T WASTE YOUR MONEY!,Seriously!I bought this march 24 2022. Todays review is Dec 4 2022. I Charge over night and by 3 pm they are dead.Needless to say very inconvenient as I am Doctors offices for business all day. They all have glass windows with a little  slot. I can’t hear them.Options1) I quit working at 3 pm.2) Engage actually stands behind their product .3) Spend more money and buy  a quality product from a company that stands behind their product.This old adage rings true .Something that costs less in the beginning costs more  in the long run.(8 months is evidently a long time .)
23,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,I did not realize how much I was unable to hear until now,"These are very easy to use.  Convenient charging case.  They are very small and discreet.  They are so comfortable, I forget I have them in.  I did not realize how much I was missing when others spoke.  Now I can understand what everyone else is saying."
23,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Not a lot of experience, but they make a difference","These are the first real hearing aids I've gotten,so I have a limited perspective.They seem well designed and come with a handy case that can recharge them several times. Included is all the stuff you need to get started, things to clean the unit and maintain it, so good thought process there.The units themselves are very small and unobtrusive, fitting snuggly behind the ears, Took a few tries to get theearpxiece to fir but I expected that.In use the controls are simple, perhaps too simple compare with other units I've seen from friends. The Lucid app only has a three star rating.In use? They bring out the high end sounds I have dropped as I got older very nicely, they do make quite a difference once you get them adjusted to your preference, I ended up using the open ear pieces, you hear your voice better and it sounds more natural. You lose sound quality if you stream music via Bluetooth with them but I don't intend to do that, the fidelity is limited, as you might guess.So far so good, Lucid does have the option of going to a Sam's club where they have people who can help you set them up. Sadly, none near me."
23,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Absolutely Awesome,"I didn't purchase mine thru Amazon; the Lucid Engage store just happened to be offering a discount so I saved about $100, but even at $999, these are still a bargain.  I have moderate hearing loss (too many years working around sawmills and heavy machinery in my younger years).  I was tested by an audiologist a year ago but just couldn't stomach spending nearly $9000 on a set of hearing aids.  The Lucid Engage hearing aids for about 8 grand less give me almost all of the abilities of the set I tried from the audiologist other than some IFTT functionality.I received these quickly, took a couple of hours to charge them, put them in my ears and instantly improved my hearing.  People that I work with have noticed that I'm not asking them to repeat themselves.  They're comfortable - I immediately went to wearing them 10-12 hours a day and they work for phone conversations/ bluetooth to my phone.I use these with the iPhone app and it works pretty good.  It occasionally loses connectivity but so far sticking them in the  charging case and taking them back out in a minute or two seems to solve the problem.All in all, recommended."
23,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Sorry no streaming,"My Phonak rechargeable hearing aids had to to in for service. Unfortunately that's 2-3, and sometimes longer.  (I've used Phonak hearing aids for a decade.) So I decided I pick up some OTC hearing aid for these type of emergencies.  At a large wholesale club I was shown the Lucid Engage. I was only asked one question, was my phone an iphone or android, based on that they handed my a box.Getting them going was easy and the sound was fine. This was great. Then I received a call and rather than a tone in my ear there was ringing in my pants pocket. I couldn't take the call through the hearing aids. In fact I couldn't stream anything through them. What a disappointment!!! I called tech support and basically it came down to ""too bad so sad.""  There was nothing on the packaging about this.Disappointed."
23,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Which do you want, technology, or simplicity?","These hearing aids are absolutely amazing... for the right person.  They are loaded with technology, and even let you listen to music through them, but there is definitely a learning curve if you want to get the most out of these hearing aids.  A younger person would probably be really excited about these, as the app allows so much customization.  An older person, on the other hand, may benefit from a more simple device.Pros:- They are are discrete when wearing, and comfortable.- Has 4 different programs - Mild, Moderate, Bass Boost and Max (max is Bass Boost + max volume)- Noise reduction works great - You can also change the volume of steaming music, with noise reduction, so you can use the hearing aids while listening to music.- Has manual buttons as well- Fully charges in 4-5 hoursCons:- Can be overly complicated to set up- Requires you to manually set up, instead of having a professional set up, so you may undercut yourself if you don't set it up correctly."
23,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Extremely powerful, yet almost invisible","Lucid hearing engage aid is like a tiny amazing robot that seems to do things beyond making things louder. My elderly has been losing hearing over time, and in uneven way, like certain noises sound like screeching painful but voices are muffled and not comprehended. It’s almost like a range or frequency problem but he has been against looking like “old” person with hearing aids. The Lucid hearing aid is almost invisible, with a lightweight box that completely hides behind the ear and almost clear and thin plastic piece in the front that holds the ear plug inside the ear, which is also tiny that you can’t really see it. This, he finally accepted and it’s been like magic. He can hear clearly, even with just one on, that those of us who got used to having to shout at the top of our lungs had trouble adjusting to talking in normal talking voices to him. The weird amplified side noises went away and he doesn’t complain about them. It connects to his android phone, and you can use as little or as much of the fancy functions as needed, which makes it good for tech savvy/not savvy/young/older. The case is sturdy and fit as a housing for the tiny robot. The outer box is beautiful, like a high end gift, nothing like a medical equipment for elderly. The price has actually gone down since I last checked this item, making it more affordable. This would be an awesome Christmas gift for those who need a wide range of auditory assistance."
23,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Was very happy with aids until,...","Lucid will not repair any of their devices after five years of service. If less than five years and out of warranty, you are given a flat repair fee of $400.00 without questioning what is wrong with the aid(s). Could be just a cleaning,... they don't care.Not budget friendly no matter how long you have been a loyal customer."
23,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very Pleased,"Only had them two days but I'm very impressed.  Sync'd with my Pixel 6 Pro with one small glitch.  Seemed to get stuck with the rotating circle on ""Welcome to Lucid Hearing"" page.  Closed and reopened the app and tested all features OK.  Box says Present not Lucid but the charger case does say Lucid.  Product must have been sold.  Used them in a noisy bar and could hear OK.  The charger case is a nice feature.  My previous aids were expensive ($5K) Siemens and failed after 5 years.  Only thing I miss is the directional feature.  My voice sounds loud in the aids but I'll get used to it. Best I have found for the money.5/22 - Well had them for awhile now.  I don't get anywhere near the 22 hr. they spec.ed.  Sometimes they start warning low battery after a few hours.  I'm not sure why.  I have alternated the charging slots and no difference.  Have started opening an closing the battery door every morning to see if that helped but no change.  A lady with a purse would have no problem carrying the charger box but it's a lot in a man's pocket.  I still think they are a great deal for the money.7/24 Still pleased.  Batteries now need recharge after aboout 8 hr..  I charge them over night then swap their slots while I make the bed.  Usually done by the time I finish the bed.  Sometomes last from 8 to 8.  App disapears sometimes but reconnects when I click the icon.  As mentioned by others the do not retain their settings so I reset them as necessary.  Generally a great help."
23,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Engage Appreciation,"I had my hearing tested a couple of years and the audiologist confirmed a hearing loss.  I was programmed with a pair of hearing aids that worked great but cost $5,000 so I decided to just live with the loss.I recently tried the Engage product as the price was much more reasonable.  They have been absolutely life changing!  The startup was simple and straightforward and within minutes of unboxing the product, it became clear to me all that I had been missing.  I take extreme joy every single day in hearing things that otherwise would have gone unnoticed and not having to constantly ask people to repeat themselves in conversation.Thank you and well done Engage Team on a great product!"
23,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,,No sirve
23,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Easy to use,"This hearing aid is easy to put on, easy to charge and easy to clean. I like how you can control the hearing aid with your phone. This hearing aid feels solid, good quality."
23,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Won’t hold a full charge,Reallly comfortable and love that they Bluetooth with my iPhone. But I returned them because the right hearing aid would not stay charged.
23,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,The left battery wouldn't hold a charge,I thought the hearing aids were very comfortable. The downside was the left battery would not hold a charge for more than 6-7 hours and people would comment that it sounded like an AM radio station with static and an annoying clicking noise even after I tried doing sound adjustments. I returned them after having them for less than a week.
23,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,An investment in Relationships,"I have had some hearing issues for 30 years.  Conversations have been challenging and not so much for me, but my family obviously did not enjoy the continual ""What did you say?""  I decided to wait until some bluetooth, cell phone interactive devices came along.  Here they are, and without the expense of an audiologist visit.I prefer the vented tips as it allows a more natural sound that is not overpowering.  Thank you!"
23,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent hearing aids,"For the price, excellent quality. My first hearing aids were $6000. They lasted  9 years, but each had to be rebuilt twice at $600 a pop. These Engage hearing aids have better audio quality, are rechargeable (no more batteries!!) and work flawlessly with my IPhone. If they last, it will be the best investment I have made for my health."
23,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Very Disappointed,"After reading the highlights of the Lucid Engage hearing aid I decided this was the one for me.. ""NOT"", All types of malfunctions.  Continuous whistling in my ears, one minute they're on then automatically turn off or vice-versa.  App works, then it don't work.  Some serious adjustments is needed to make this hearing aid work as indicated.  So sad- I  thought I found a good product. ""NOT"". IT'S TERRIBLE"
23,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Tinny and lost connection every 30 seconds,"I purchased these and quickly returned them.  Perhaps, I received a pair that was faulty.  The sound quality didn’t seem good to me; sounds had a tinniness and the volume fluctuated on its own.  I tried to connect them to my iPhone to listen to a podcast, and they couldn’t maintain a connection,If someone needs simple hearing aids that amplify volume and modulate surrounding noise, I think a pair of these that doesn’t have the glitches I had would be just fine,"
23,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent product!!!,These hearing aids are the best I've had. Compatibility with iPhone was important as was rechargeable. These fulfill that on both fronts. The functionality is the biggest feature. My hearing hasn't been this good in several years. Well worth the cost.
23,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Size large adjustable but you have to buy the smaller size tubes,The tubes are for large ears and were too long for mine. It says to just call customer service and they can get you a smaller size. The tubes cost $75.00 each so plan to spend $150.00 more of they don’t fit. I sent them back.
23,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,A Rip-off?,"I bought a pair a few months ago, and I lost one of them (these devices are easy to lose, especially if you wear a mask), and I wanted to buy one, but I was told by a representative that I have to buy the two. Isn't this a rip-off? I will not deal with Lucid again."
23,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best I’ve tried without paying a fortune,"My hearing loss made it difficult to understand some speech, especially on different tv programs.These hearing aids are working for me, best ones I’ve tried under a $1,000. I’ve tried more expensive ones and sent them back. These ones are keepers.Thank you Lucid for the Engage hearing aides."
23,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not ready for prime time,"Was very excited to get these as they have blue tooth, BUT blue tooth is very inconsistent. Also have to try to reconnect for every use, maddening!.  Sound quality is much worse than that of my Iphone 7.  I would suspect quality control and programming issues."
23,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great hearing aid,This is a great lower cost over-the-counter hearing. I have many times more for prescription hearing aides that don’t work nearly as well for me. Plenty of volume and configure ability for me and comes with Bluetooth and recharge ability.
23,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,First time user of hearing aids,Was able to hear things I haven't heard on years. The only thing that I have had any trouble with is connecting to phone to stream radio and answer calls from phone hopefully will resolve with tech support
23,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Battery life.,I really like the performance of these heating aids but the batteries are not holding much of a charge after 45 days of use. Does anyone know where I can buy replacement batteries?
23,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Start hearing what you been missing,","First off I would like to say I have been looking for a quality device that would allow me to hear everything and everyone again like I did when I was younger. Well mission accomplished.Have had my Engage hearing device powered by Lucid for around 6 weeks now and they have definitely checked all the boxes. Comfortable, Easy to use, Discreet and sound quality is fantastic, no back noise and squealing like I experienced with a few other brands I purchased in past. Retuned all others. That won’t be the case with these. Having my hearing restored has allowed me to enjoy a lot of life That I been missing. Going to my grandchildren’s wrestling meets and being able to actually hear everything in clarity and comfort and not all garbled together and no range is something I’m enjoying since I purchased engage.  Hope they continue to perform at this level for along time.  Priceless!!"
23,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good product with a very handy charger.,"I bought this product for my father. He has been using them for about a week now, and he is really enjoying them. It took a couple of days for him to adjust, but I have noticed a big improvement. They also come with a handy charging case that can be carried around for on the go charging."
23,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Buyer Beware,"The app does not work for anything other than adjusting the volume. What a joke, an expensive joke. No one from Lucid seems to know how to get the blue tooth to actually work. Not to mention as soon as you get them you have to send them to Lucid for an update. I'll be getting a refund."
23,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,We couldn't get them to setup to the level my husband needs.,Tiny ear covers too awkward and didn't stay on.  Couldn't get levels to setup to the volumn my husband needed.
23,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Not enough volume for mother.,"We wanted to try these and they just don't have enough power for my 94 year old mother. We were hoping for this to work, but unfortunately her hearing is so bad we couldn't use them.If you have SEVERE hearing loss, these probably won't work to well...."
23,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent product, I recommend them hands down!","What can I say other then, they work great. Had another Lucid hearing aid I paid $940.00 for a single aid and the pair I purchased here work just as good if not better because the app allows you to change the hearing tones to your needs in any environment as needed."
23,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fantastic,"These hearings aids are a blessing,I charged them up and connected to my blue tooth. The first time I went outside I could hear the birds singing, and all the sounds I had lost and never realized it. The difference is like night and day, I couldn’t be happier"
23,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Still learning & experimenting.,"While I am still learning how to use my hearing aids, I am pleased so far. I have had aids from $4500 to $160, and this is my 5th set in 15 years. I love that I don’t have to buy batteries, comfort and easy to clean."
23,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wow!,This works for me!  You have to get used to settings first.  Then get bluetooth receiver for TV so it streams directly to HA.  Can't wait for that.
23,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Do not work as advertised,Actually after replacing the original pair with a second pair thinking I had a bad pair .................NO they do not stay connected to the app or iPhone 12 for either the hearing aid function or Bluetooth.  Both pair are extremely aggravating to use and totally useless.
23,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent Hearing Aids,I have had another set of hearing aids from a different manufacturer for the past two years.  I have decided and try another manufacturer and what a difference!  I am very pleased in my first two weeks.
23,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,Lucid hearing engage very disappointed with cost expected better quality,Not a hearing aid with options.. more just an amplifier..not happy at all
23,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,More than what I expected,"When I finally decided to consider hearing aids, I tried two different audiologists in the area, and tried their top of the line hearing aids. With one, everything lagged, creating an echo effect. With the second, they tried a ""bait and switch"" that I won't tolerate.These hearing aids, costing about 10% of what these big name devices run, do what I had hoped. And I received more. I had some questions about them and several times contacted their Tech Support group through their website. They have quickly (same day responses) answered my questions, and gave me helpful tips to make them work at peak performance the Lucid software for my phone allows me to make a lot of adjustments, stream audio, take phone calls, and even get notifications and text messages.Very pleased with the product and with the support.Highly recommend!"
23,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Finally, something that works!","Being a young hard of hearing person is always such a struggle, that’s why I am so grateful for engage. My favorite feature is the streaming function. I can turn it on all the way to streaming and not pick up any ambient noise and just fully hear my music when working out or just sitting at my desk grading papers. 10 out of 10 for me!"
23,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Life Changing,"I have had hearing loss since I was 18 years old and was always hesitant to get hearing aides. I finally decided I needed to get some so that I could stop saying ""excuse me"" or ""what"" every time someone spoke to me.  I received my Engage hearing aides and once I charged them I put them in and immediately heard sounds I have not heard in years!  The wind rustling, BIRDS CHIRPING, the ceiling fan etc.  My husband was able to speak to me from across the room and I heard everything he said.  These are truly life changing and so easy to use.  I can set the volume higher or lower from my Iphone and change settings.  I am not one to usually write reviews but these are so amazing I highly recommend them to anyone that has even the slightest hearing loss."
23,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Discrete aids with clear sound.,These are really great hearing aids. They have a very discrete design which is also very comfortable and lightweight. The sound produced is very clear. These hearing aids work well with android devices. Definitely worth the price!
23,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you want an A-1 product, easy to use, and affordable, these are the ones for you!","I’m in my 80s and noticed my hearing was getting less and less.  A very good friend recommended the Lucid hearing aid partly because of the quality of the product, the ease of using, and the knowledge of the representative explaining everything.  She was very thorough and readily answered all my questions.  I’m very pleased with my hearing aids and look forward to better hearing ahead."
23,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love the hearing aid,Great hearing aid
23,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"After weeks of research, I went with these...","As you can see in the picture, the Lucid Engage hearing aids are almost invisible. They are very comfortable and I felt the sound was excellent from the minue I put them in two days ago.  This AM I reached out to customer support online and after a few minutes I learned a whole lot more about customizing the experience with my Lucid app on my iPhone.  Pairing them with your iPhone is a snap as long as you follow the insuructions! I am very happy with this purchase and I saved thousands over whet Medicare was offering me for lower tech hearing aids. I receive all of my cell phone calls directly through my hearing aids and I can stream music too but that sound cannot compare to what I can hear through my Apple Ear Pods but that is to be expected.  My last comment is that they are extremely comfortable!"
23,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazingly good!,"I've only had these for one day, but the difference between these and my last pair is evident.  The sound, across the entire spectrum, is much clearer.  And it passes bass sounds, something no other aids have done for me.  I had trouble setting up the bluetooth for iPhone control, and a very nice person got me through it quickly.  The instructions provided with the aids for bluetooth connection could be a bit more extensive, but hey, I got it done.  I would highly recommend these aids."
23,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing Hearing Aids,"These were a huge surprise.  High quality all around.  Lightweight, comfortable, rechargeable, accurate reproduction of sound.  Quick and easy setup with the app.  Makes calls, streams music, and connects to my tv and lets me set my own volume while everyone else hears the speakers at a lower volume."
23,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Equal to, or better, than $4000 Signia charge and go aids.","Remarkable deal and high quality.  Many adjustments for comfort, long change, recharge in case when traveling, Quality made and small.  Great support and customer service, and beautifully packaged.  I am really surprised at the quality as I was hesitant to buy these.  I have no criticisms about these aids.  Fully adjustable manually or with the excellent app they provide.  Amazing deal at $800 for the pair.  As you can tell, I'm more than satisfied."
15,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,There are better OTC hearing aids that this giant size MDHearing OTC BTE Volt Max,"Do not recommend doing business with MDHearing. Regardless of how they market themselves, their customer service is very poor. When I have canceled this order in less than 24 h since the order for this giant BTE hearing aids was placed I used any MDHearing communication channel to contact them with the cancelation. They purposely avoided to get in touch with their customer so they can push-shipping their product and not following with cancelation request.Do not recommend MDHearing as reliable and helpful customer service which they are not. With this anti-customer behavior one can imagine how helpful they could be further in the sophisticated fitting and optimal programing of their outdated hearing aids like Volt Max?!"
15,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Bull. They will give you hassle to return and charge shipping,Cheap China made !!!!
15,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Horrible-really, horrible----","I have had these for several months. They squeal no matter what you do. Even when you get next to something-a cabinet, frig, wall-they squeal. Try to adjust them-they squeal. Move them-they squeal. Hold them in your hand-they squeal. The battery does not last 12 hours. The sound is horrible-I can NOT understand the TV even with the volume turned way up. I can NOT have conversations with people because I can NOT hear them well enough-their words sound garbled. Now-even after a few short months-they won't charge. The lights on the charger blink then go out & do not charge. I was going to purchase a new charger-however-$100.00 is far too much to pay for another piece of garbage. These hearing ""amplifiers"" will be trashed as soon as I can find a decent pair of ""hearing AIDS"". Do NOT waste your money on these worthless pieces of junk."
15,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Did not work, and these can't be found with the ""hearing aid finder""","I got these for my husband who lost his hearing due to Covid.  He said they did not work, so I would turn the volume up and they would beep horribly.  His ear specialist asked him about them and he told them they didn't improve his hearing at all.While some of the MD hearing aids can be found with their finder app if you misplace one or both, the AIR style cannot.  That is so annoying!  Tell us that up front before we buy them!Piece of junk."

I have confirmation that there were received but have not received refund after 2 months. The customer service is a total scam. I just waited for the third time for 20 minutes on hold and ultimately got message saying no one was available to call back later.Do not waste your money or time with these. They are useless and the company is a scam."
15,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love my new hearing aids.,"I was a little uneasy at first to buy them. Glad I did It was big change in my hearing. I Have better hearing in both ears. Since I have bought these. Easy to charge and wear feels great. I forget I have them on. If money is tight, you won't go wrong.  Della Withrow"
15,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,very good hearing aid for this price,"Overall I really like these hearing aids. They are easy to charge, although you have to pay attention to make sure they are both charging. The controls are super easy. The sound is digital, meaning that it is a bit thin and sometimes shrill, but overall, good sound and very consistent. Does an excellent job of making voices easy to understand."

15,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good product,This is a good product but it did not work for my type of hearing loss.
15,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Don’t last long,I’ve had these for 7 months and one is not working.  This product is  no better  than the $100 hearing aids I purchased from another company prior . Disappointing!
15,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Tricky to handle,Simply did not work for me.
15,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,Too complicated to operate,Programs were very confusing; hard to hear the number of beeps for each program.  Hard to push the buttons while on my ear to adjust the volume and/or programs.  Disappointing.
15,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,You get what you pay for.,The sound quality is good IF you can get past the frequent shrill feedback
15,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Best OTC hearing aids,"Easy to use. You adjust them  the first time you put them on, and then they remember that setting,so you don’t have to keep resetting every time you take them off.They turn on when you take them out of the case,and turn off when you put them back.  It makes things easier.Not the best at muting ambient noises, but also doesn’t cost $10,000."

12,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Significantly improves my hearing,"Lexie B2 Powered by Bose. As a teacher, I was having increasing difficulty understanding soft-spoken students.  The Lexie has solved this problem.  I've been using them a week now and I have been very pleased with them.  Before buying them, I was worried about whether they would fall off, or pinch my ears, but happily these have turned out to be non-problems.  Furthermore, they are pretty inconspicuous - not that I want to hide that I'm using such prosthetics, but I don't want people fixated on them, either.  Their charge gets me through the day without any problems, and the USB-powered charging case keeps them from getting misplaced during the night when I charging them.  They are controlled by an app on my cell phone via Bluetooth.  I works fine, but in my opinion is the weakest part of the product, for it is not very well thought through.  For instance, every time I open it, it wants to know whether I want to ""Sign out, Restart or Continue"", whereas of course the answer is always ""Continue"", and then twice in a row (!) presents a menu asking what model of hearing aid I have, whereas of course the answer always is the same (and only) model whose volume I was adjusting an hour ago.  The Lexie/Bose software engineers would do well to take a look how the software in a typical car interfaces with the driver's cell phone, which is much better thought through.  Anyway, the product greatly improves my ability to understand what the people around me are saying, and I'm very glad that I bought it."
12,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Fine, but. . .","I have had Phonak and COSTCO branded hearing aids in the past. They were fine but, frankly, I did not want to spend $1,300 or more for a replacement pair (my previous ones were nearly 10 years old). With the Bose name, I thought these would be a good alternative.And they are. The sound quality is very good and the fit is excellent.  They are certainly a lot better than many of the hearing devices which are really no more than sound amplifiers (and, yes, I tried a couple). What I don't like, however, is the smartphone app which, in my case, is for my Android phone.To start with, after initially pairing the app does not automatically connect to the hearing devices.  You have to open the app and then turn on the devices. Only then will it connect to the app. Okay, fine. An inconvenience but I could live with it. BUT (big ""but""), once you close the app, it will not find and reconnect to the devices when you open it, say, to change the volume or mode. Nope. You have to power down the hearing aids, open the app, then turn the devices on again. This is very annoying when you're in a group setting or at a restaurant and want to make an adjustment.So, my criticism is the app, not the devices. But seen as a >total product<, Lexie has some work to do.  They sooner they improve the app, the happier I will be and would move the rating to five-stars."
12,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Service is terrible - excuse after excuse,"Do not deal with this company.  They are disorganized, do not complete tasks and I will be returning my order and wonder if I will receive a refund.  Will update.Quality - appear well made.  Connection to application has to be redone each time it is used.  Software give you access to volume, balance (R/L) , treble /bass .  About the same as a Sony walkman from the 80's.  High frequencies screech if treble increased.  A lot of crackle as well.  Some noise reduction, but almost insignificant.My wires were too short and would fall out of ear canal often, especially when chewing.  This is why I measured ears and saw that I needed wire #3.  This is when I found out how poor service quality is.So I called to ask for the #3 wires and needed to email a copy of the Amazon receipt for Lexie to process.  My wife emailed it to Henry in support.  I was to receive a call asking for $10 for shipping.  Did not happen.  I call again and talk to Tsiamo, he can not see my email and goes to Henry's desk to look for receipt and can not find it.  I send to Tsiamo the receipt who connects me with accounts receivable to collect the $10.  Told by AR that the wires would be sent.  More than two weeks later - still no wires.  I call back today and am told that it was not communicated to send the wires and that they could not find a phone # or email address for me.  If they would google me I do pop right up - name/email/phone number.  They could have also asked me or even looked at there call log - if they have one.  Buying through Amazon shortens the time you have from 45 Days to 37(?) days which makes the loss of more than two weeks too much.  While writing this I have now received 2 emails from Lexie - only the loss of $1,000 appears to be enough motivation for these employees.Finally, service is not US based - only sales.  Very difficult to understand what they are saying with the \ terrible sound quality of their phones.  At least they are polite."
12,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Lexie B2 OTC Hearing Aids Powered by Bose,"I am completely satisfied with these hearing aids. They can only be bought in pairs, because they are designed to work together. The price is very attractive compared to the overpriced hearing aids on the market. When the Lexie B2 are used for what they are designed for they work great! However, they will not work for everyone. I was fortunate that my hearing impairment was in the correct range of these hearing aids. I have mild hearing loss in one ear and moderate in the other. If you have more than moderate hearing loss in either ear, these hearing aids will not satisfy you. (Get or take online a hearing test). Most people loose high frequency hearing first and it keeps getting worse over time. They usually notice it when it starts to affect speech and TV watching. Things like gun fire, explosions, loud head phones, loud music etc. can start the hearing loss process. Looking back, I should have protected my hearing more. I hope those of you with good hearing now, will take heed to this. The settings on the Lexie B2 hearing aids are designed to be easy to use and you do not have to be an audiologist to adjust them. The frequency loss settings are hidden in the Tone (high frequency) and Base (Low frequency) settings. The App has one slider for Tone/Bass. Many people have more loss in one ear than the other so there is a balance setting to adjust for the weaker ear. This setting works great and is easy to adjust by trial and error. Most people with hearing loss have trouble in noisy environments and I do also. There is a focus setting that lets you focus forward for conversations in noisy environments and an everywhere setting for normal environments. This works for me and I see great improvement when using this.  The World volume raises and lowers the amplification and keeps your balance, focus and Tone/Base settings as previously set. The world volume works with the app or the volume button on either ear. Raising or lowering world volume on either ear set it on both ears. The last very handy feature is the saved settings one. You can save up to ten different named settings and switch between them using the phone app. One is labelled Everyday and this one is the normal setting to use most of the time. The phone app uses Bluetooth to communicate to the hearing aids. This will disconnect sometimes and unfortunately may be difficult to reconnect. I have found that if I turn off Bluetooth on the phone and then turn it back on, I can reconnect without having to put the hearing aids in to the charging dock or turning them off/on . Both of these last two methods are more difficult than just recycling the Bluetooth setting on the phone. The world volume setting I use for everyday is 40% of the max setting. They can definitely amply sound for seniors. I raise the world volume setting to 60% for watching TV so I can have the TV volume very low. The Tone setting for me is at max due to my high frequency hearing loss. Since mine is at max I can see these hearing aids will not work for people with more than moderate hearing loss. Unfortunately, those with severe hearing loss will have to select another hearing aid."
12,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Did not help in noisy bars but good for tv,"The Lexie B2 hearing aids fit well hardly noticeable and were comfortable .  I had them for less than a day and someone from the company called to see if I needed help or had any questions. I had already set up the hearing aids and my only question was how to adjust for different surroundings. The app already has four presets and more can be created. But the fine tuning is trial and error because everybody’s hearing is different.The initial set up downloading the app ect was pretty easy and explained well, except for one step of going into my iPhone settings to accessibility, then hearing devices, then following steps on screen.The only adjustments are to volume, a slide from bass to treble, a control to balance volume from left to right ear,mutes for one or both ears directionality for front or everywhere and as mentioned earlier the presets.The hearing aids do stream to the phone and when bass is increased they make pretty good iPods. When the phone rings or a phone alarm goes off it is extremely LOUD . Like what the **€£%#**.These hearing aids do help with watching TV and general every day hearing. I find the noise suppression lacking.I have difficulty hearing conversations in restaurants and places with loud music. I was able to increase overall volume and tinkering with pitch somewhat helped but not enough to carry on a complete conversation. So my goal wasn’t met.I did not care for the fact that there is no way to increase both bass and treble while leaving mid range. Also sound suppression was not adjustable and not effective. I do not know if these two factors would have helped me with listening to conversations in noisy places.These aids were more consistently reliable than another like priced brand of aids."
12,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,"A LOT of squealing, cell phone connection reliability is lousy at best.","I've had my $2700 Oticon hearing aids for 4 years now, they are getting tired.  After the hearing aid store wanted $5400 for new hearing aids, I ordered the Lexie Bose aids.  In comparison, these $800 aids are not as good as the Oticon aids, but they are15% of the cost of the new Oticon aids.These Bose aids do not have the amount of speech compression as the Oticon units, and they do not have the same volume.  But, the sound clarity of the Bose aids is notably superior to the Oticon aids.My hearing loss has been rated as moderate by an audiologist.  Since understanding vocal speech is notably improved with the Bose unit, I will keep them.A big negative though, the amount of squealing that is present with these hearing aids.  For me, I gradually grew to ignore them, but my wife across the room complains about it.After using these hearing aids for several weeks, one real pain in the *** has showed up.  You have to manually turn them on after charging them.  But after they are powered up, you have to power them down and back up again if you want to change any settings.  That is a real problem.  I didn't know that at a recent outdoor concert, and had these hearing aids blasting my ears at full volume for several hours.Finally, after using them for three weeks, I am tired of all of the problems and am returning them to Amazon for a full refund."
12,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,I'm pleased with the quality and usability of this product. Completely satisfied.,"So far, I'm amazed at how much Lexie's helped me. I've had them in for almost a week and I have no complaints. Feeling them in my ears is kind of weird and when I think about them I feel like I want to scratch my ears, but only if I'm thinking about them. I wore them while playing music with friends  and they really helped in that regard. I could clearly hear my guitar and also my voice when I was singing. I feel they will improve my music abilities. It is kind of cool to hear things that I haven't heard in many decades like my feet resulting from the leaves when I'm walking outside on a nice dry day. The creeks of my house floor boards when I'm walking around the house, And, I no longer have to turn down the base and turn up the volume and treble on my sound system to understand a narrator reading an audiobook.  In fact, I don't have to slow down the speed of the book either as I have had in the past to understand. I was slowing it to .9 or .8 of normal speed. And, the free Lexie app is very easy to use and they were easily set up for use. For now I'm only using 45 percent of the amplification, and I have set the treble up to just about 5 or 10 points, and that works fine. I usually insert them after I take a shower in the morning and I usually take them out late in the afternoon, unless I'm doing music or listening to an audiobook later in the day.They charge in three hours and the charge is supposed to last for about 15 hours. Overall, I think it was a great investment. I'm very satisfied."
12,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent hearing aid value that includes Blue Tooth iPhone call streaming and noise cancelling.,"I have been wearing hearing aids since 2019 due to hearing loss (more loss in the left ear, less loss in the right ear). I recently had an issue with my very expensive 4-year-old pair that was going to cost me $2,000+ for replacement. I found the Lexie B2 OTC Hearing Aids for only $899 and thought I would give them a try.I am pleased to report that they are be better than my old expensive Signia hearing aids ever were at improving my hearing. The tone adjustment is much more effective than my Signia NX3 rechargeables. My left ear has the most hearing loss. The left hearing aid now has me hearing as good as the right ear. (My Signia set performed poorly in that aspect.) They have all of the similar features such as noise cancelling settings for noisy locations, watching television, outdoor sports activities, streaming phone calls, etc.The User Manual has incorrect information regarding Blue Tooth use. It specifically states that phone calls cannot be streamed. Ignore the User Manual statement and follow the one-page insert included in the box. They stream phone calls without any issue. I downloaded the App from the Apple App Store. It easily connected to the hearing aids. I read reviews that indicated problems with that, but I had no such issues. I guess they fixed whatever Blue Tooth issues that may have previously existed. NOTE: on an iPhone, you can go to ""Settings/Accessibility/Hearing Devices"". It will confirm connection status, battery levels and provide other adjustments that you can make.I also read a review that complained about squealing when they get their ear near anything. I had that occur, but it was easily corrected by following the trouble shooting guidelines in the User Manual. I simply replace the vented ear dome on that hearing aid with a solid dome (included in the box). Also note that having the volume up very high will almost always cause that to occur, usually fixable with the solid cones.If you are a first-time user of hearing aids, be patient. It takes a while to get used to them. Try using them for only a few hours at a time and gradually work up to leaving them in all day. I did that in the beginning of wearing hearing aids and it work out well."
12,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,First Time Wearing Hearing Aids,"Had my hearing tested by an audiologist about ten years ago who told me I had moderate hearing loss.  Fast forward to about six months ago, had my hearing tested again, this time by a national retail chain well known for testing and then selling hearing aids, among a few thousand other products, and had the same diagnosis.  I wore their recommended brand of hearing aids around the store for about 30 minutes just for the heck of it, but couldn't pull the trigger.  Went to my physician a few days ago for my annual physical and the topic of hearing was discussed, and that's when I decided to go for it.  (When he explained that better hearing reduced the possibility of dementia, I made up my mind.)I did a lot of concentrated research and concluded that these babies were the best choice for me.  I just completed my first day wearing these hearing aids and here is what I can share.  Upon receiving them, I immediately hooked them up to the charger to make sure I had a full charge.  I downloaded the app with no problems whatsoever.  I am finding the app very easy to use.  I inserted each of the color coded hearing aids into my ears for a very nice, comfortable, and snug fit.I've been wearing them all day.  By the end of the day I have not had to make any significant sound level adjustments, even though I was playing around with the app just to see and hear its capabilities.  All sounds are very well amplified to the point where some of the sounds don't seem to be natural.  My voice, for example is most noticeable.  When going for a walk, I was able to hear the high frequency sounds of birds chirping to where I thought that maybe the sound was built into the hearing aids.  There were other sounds that I either didn't hear before or wasn't paying attention to those sounds.  This includes the turn signals in my car.  Other sounds include the sound of crinkling paper, water from the spout hitting the sink, the tapping sounds of the keys on my computer keyboard, my feet striking a wooded floor as I walked, etc.  Even my wife's voice, which is now more annoying, has a different sound.  (No longer can she say I have selective hearing.)  I have found that the connection to my phone for music is like having the wireless pods directly in my ears that I would otherwise use for my music.  The most positive thing for me is that I can hear the television sound more clearly without having to turn up the sound and creating lots of drama in the home.  Whether I will continue the need for closed captions for movies remains to be seen.The app includes information about how much of a charge is left, which in my case after wearing for about seven hours I still have 75% left. So, I am assuming that I will achieve the 18 hour charge that is stated in the literature without any problem.By the way, the cost for these hearing aids is about almost 50% of the cost at the retailer previously mentioned.  Keep in mind we're not necessarily comparing apples to apples because the retailer provides the set-up and further hands on assistance if needed which is not available from this purchase.The purchase includes a return window of 45 days if I'm not completely satisfied, but as of right now, I would say that I made a good purchase."
12,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Restocking charge,"My husband ordered the Lexie B2 February 6, 2024 through Amazon. He had two other more expensive brands that did not work as well as these.  After 90 days one earpiece would not recharge. Contacted Lexie and was instructed to return them to Amazon.  Received a refund of $719.20 leaving a difference of $179.80 this was a restocking charge because the return was outside Amazon 30 day return policy.  Lexie has a one year warranty.  Explained this to Amazon. After numerous phone calls, hang up, disconnects, emails and agents Amazon is refunding $100.00 back as a promotional credit and we were instructed to call back tomorrow and Amazon will refund the balance of $79.80 again as a promotional credit.  In the mean time he is waiting to reorder."
12,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,Poor Customer Service From Lexie,Received the hearing aids from Amazon a day after ordering them.  Tried the for a day and determined that I need the longer wire from the ear piece to the part inserted into the ear.  Contacted Lexie customer service and they stated they would ship the parts.  Never showed up.  Contacted Lexie customer service several days later to cancel my account and then Amazon to start the return.  The hearing aids arrived back at Amazon on Feb 1 according to the UPS and Amazon websites.  Checked Amazon website on Feb 12 and said there was a issuing the refund.  Again contacted Amazon and they said they would start the refund process and would credit my credit card in 3 to 5 days.  Feel Amazon was slow rolling the return.
12,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Needs an EQ system to really work,"I didn't like that when I adjusted the Left/Right option.  When I increased the left volume the right volume decreased.  It really needs an EQ so  can adjust to what I want to hear, not the limited controls available."
12,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,You can trust Bose,"I bought these aids for 90 year old mom . We have tryed Costco ones at close to 3000, the ones from ear doctor for 5000 lost one and the other dropped on the floor and broke in to pieces.  Several of the 100 pairs. The lexi bose are working great . Cant see them in moms ears. The pairing to my smart phone was very easy and very understandable,  mom adjustes them herself. I would say the biggest drawback is putting them on moms 90 year old fingers aren't that nimble anymore.  But thats getting better everyday so not any reason to take a star away . Definitely 5 stars and i would highly recommend them."
12,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Lexie B2 hearing aids.,Sound quality was good but feed back and background noise was a problem.
12,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,Hearing aids,"Retuned, I thought I would give OTC aids a shot. Nothing compares to what you purchase from an audiologist. You get what you pay for I guess. Bluetooth was terrible also."
12,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,At last...,"I bought the Lexie B2 powered by Bose hearing aids and put them in 2 days ago. OMG these are soooo much better than the $4500 Phonak set my ENT office tried to fit me with. These are smaller, snug around my ear, the sound quality is far better than the bucket-over-my-head from the Phonaks. I loaded the app onto my android phone (this needs some tweaking still...) so any adjustments are easy and convenient. I have used them at home for TV viewing and in busy restaurants switching from overall to front directional sound and it works perfectly! I have not yet found a need to change the presets--just VERY happy with my improved hearing ability."
12,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,I'm All Ears,"The Lexie B2 by Bose Hearing Aids are amazing.  My older 2015 hearing aids that cost $4000.00 were just using batteries but not working well at all.  I had recently bought some other hearing aids but returned them  because they did not perform.  These hearing aids however are a real game changer.  Right out of the box they synced up quickly with the free cell phone app that dialed in the sound profile I desired. The sound quality was profound.  Crisp hearing with bass and treble delivering a full range quality experience.  The bird tweets on my first walk outside were incredible.  Inside my home theater sound was sharp and clear.  I had to lower the volume to adjust to the enhanced perception of these outstanding hearing aids.  I used the 12 month no interest option so I did not have to alter my budget to hear again.  The safety of hearing again alone is worth the purchase, but the joy of hearing again so I can function in groups of people is immeasurable.  Do not hesitate. Stop your search here. You will celebrate hearing again!"
12,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wonderful,I purchased these for my 92 year old mother.  The audiologist wanted 4k for the same type.  They are easy to use and lightweight.  She says she can’t tell she’s wearing them they are so comfortable.  There is a slight echo but she said it doesn’t bother her. Very good quality.
12,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,No reply from Bose on technical use issue with $1000 Lexi B2 Hearing Aids.,"I was questioning if you are only wearing one of the two purchased devices, is it okay to have the one that is not being used in the charging dock when charging the used one.  They are so small that I don't want to take it out of the protective box unless necessary for overnight charging.  I have no way of knowing if charging it when it is not being used could damage it.  Pretty important question for Bose to ignore."
12,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Poor customer service,"After 5 weeks (one week after the return cut off date), the right hearing aid would hold a charge for only half the time as the left one. I tried calling the customer service and was put on hold for over 30 minutes, finally had to hang up. I tried the Chat option on their website and no one was there. Guess we'll have to deal with them not working correctly. I bought these because they were affiliated with Bose, thinking it was a quality product, boy was I wrong."
12,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,A solid 3 out of 5,"This is a great option for those not wanting to spend thousands on hearing aids, as long as your hearing loss isn't too substantial. I really liked the ability to connect to my phone and stream music; however, you have to hold the phone very close to you, otherwise the connection gets choppy (when streaming). The ear buds are very uncomfortable and they need to offer more sizes but this is a solid option. I probably would have kept these but my left hearing aid kept dropping connection and sounded static-y, almost like a loose wire or something. I returned but would order these again if I could get more comfortable tips and if the bad connection on the left side was corrected. 1/3 the price of those from the MD office."
12,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Have difficulty connecting to phone app, this decreases flexibility of these units","the sound quality was good. The units are prone to squealing whenever anything is in physical proximity. The connection to my phone app is non-existent except when they are first turned on out of the dock, this makes using the several potentially useful features extremely frustrating. A call to the help line netted me only a ""oh, sometimes they do that"". Not impressed. The cost was far less than my audiologist supplied mid-range Oticon hearing aids. I lost one and it was going to cost me twice what these did to replace the single one. I will probably keep them, they're not perfect but function well enough."
12,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Lexie app does not work,"I liked the sound quality and comfort of the Lexie hearing aids, however I could not get the Lexie app to connect to the hearing aids most of the time. I tried all of the recommendation, but gave up after two days and a lot of lost time.  Additionally I could not control the volume of the hearing aids on the devices directly, therefore without the use of the app the units became worthless.From all of the reviews on the Lexie app itself, apparently they know they have a bluetooth connection problem and have not been able to fix it.I was very disappointed because I was looking forward to a good quality hearing aid at a lower price than similar prescription units.  I will try Costco next. They are higher prices but offer testing and hopefully units that work with their associated app."
12,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great for improved hearing.,"I purchased these for my mild to moderate hearing problems. The hearing aids are perfect, comfortable and work great so far the 2 days I've had them.  The Lexie 2B app is the only difficulty - I downloaded this suggested app from Playstore and installed it on cell phone, fine.  Part of the attraction to this product is its potential flexibility to adjust to different environemnts (listening to speaking, or reducing background noise, or listening to music, or normal daily activities.) However, to do these adjustments, you must access the app and therein it becomes difficult to change the settings since the app keeps 'not connecting' to be able to change things. This needs to be fixed!  So for now I'm setting it to normal environments and leaving it there."
12,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Bad ears,"My hearing  is moderate to severe.  These hearing aids are a great improvement to my old ones.  There is a great improvement in sound clairity.  When I'm in public I see that other people are talking with each other, but I still can't hear them.  When I'm talking with someone one on one I can usually hear them.  Everyone's hearing is different, but I need more sound amplification.  They are quite adjustable for sound and tone.  For everyday use I need high volume and bass.  To listen to music I  turn down the volume and turn up the bass all the way and most music sounds fairly normal.  I will look for better options in the future."
12,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Coul be a very good product but...,"Just bought a Lexie B2 and my overall impression is positive, very positive, but:- disconnects from the phone shortly after removing it from the charger. This could be a problem because if you are in a situation where you need to change settings, you just can’t.  As a matter of fact, if you can’t connect, your only option is to manually use  the up and down volume buttons only. Nothing else…I just hope that they will fix the issue, and then I will buy it with no hesitationIt could be a very good product, but…"
12,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing product .,I love these hearing aids.  Comfortable.  Noise cancellation and directional feature is great. Highly recommend d
12,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth the price,"I have normal hearing aids, but one of my wires broke, and I needed something in the meantime until I could  fix it. (And I thought it'd be nice to just have a backup pair.). Perhaps these might seem fine for someone who has never had hearing aids, but the quality was no where near the value of $1,000 they cost. I probably wouldn't even think they're worth over $200. I adjusted the volume as well as the treble/bass in multiple settings. Every one of them was awful. It sounded like someone on a PA system the entire time. I thought maybe I just needed to get adjusted to them, but after two days, it hadn't changed, and I couldn't stand it anymore.If you need something to help amplify the sound, but NOT like a hearing aid or natural hearing, then these might work for you. Just carry a microphone with you and hand it to someone when they talk and you'll get the same result, though."
12,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Great product performance but...,"This product performs outstandingly. I purchased because it is powered by BOSE and I have always loved BOSE products. It has one  serious flaw that is not the fault of the product, but rather the ordering process.The hearing aid wire  that goes over the ear is available in three sizes. You cannot select the size prior to ordering so you get the medium size by default. If you need a different size, you must pay an additional $50 (plus tax) per ear. I need a different size and after paying over $1000 ($999 plus tax), its a bitter pill to be required to spend an additional $100 to get the hearing aids to fit properly. At a minimum there should be an exchange option."
12,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Would not receive calls from my android phone,Was a good hearing deviceAdjustable
12,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,would not set up; several professionals worked with me over the phone for over an hour each time.,"The thought of the convenience and sound power drew me to this product. We searched for a year + for hearing aids before choosing these. I worked with these for almost 2 months and was on the next-to-the-last day before returning was over and decided that these were not going to work for me. I reluctantly sent them back. All representatives that I spoke with were courteous, professional and made every effort to make these work as advertised. I needed them to sync with my phone."
12,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not so good.,"They basically just amplify the ambient sound around you. There software is lame and you need to make an account to use it. Very expensive for something that some headphones do for way less.  On that point, these have terrible audio, so can’t be used as headphones, not that is what they were marketed for. But some headphones have good sound and amplified sound so why spend so much money for less."
12,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Lexi b2 review,"Well I’ve only had them for four days so my review will be short the fit is good, set up was easy , love the charging case the b2 are very sensitive  now adjusting them was a bit tricky it takes some patience but very simple I sat outside this morning and could hear the leaves when they hit the ground If these few days are any indication of their performance it’s going to be good and the price was five times lower than my widex for that price I can afford to buy a second pair for backup. I would recommend these to anyone with mild hearing loss and shallow pockets."
12,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,I had more expectations from a Bose brand hearing aids,"I have amazing Bose speakers at home and have had several Bose headphones, all excellent and with outstanding quality sound. So, when I saw the name Bose on these hearing aids, I was expecting the same quality. I am disappointed.  The sound is unnatural, the streaming connection is unstable (sometimes, for example,  my left ear would lose connection and I would hear phone calls or streaming music only on my other ear). I already have Oticon rechargeable hearing aids that have their own issues, so I was really hoping to get a true Bose product. It isn't.  I have been using them for over a week now and am considering returning them."
12,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,Right side quilt working again,Bought the Bose for quality but right ear quit working after 45 days. Couldn’t get Bose support so I returned them to Amazon and replaced them. Bose finally contacted me 3 weeks after the return. Now the right side died after 90 days. Return no longer available and again cannot get Bose support.
12,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Ok if just for hearing aid,"Ok if I just use for hearing aid but ,if use Bluetooth it sound terrible, the noise cancellation is bad"
12,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not for me,I wanted to love these. I couldn't get them to fit properly. The app wasn't great; sometimes wouldn't connect & I frequently had to reset my settings which seemed repetitive. My expectations were higher than this product could deliver.  They seemed more like an amplifier than a hearing aid. I was worried about the return & refund but it went very well. My money was credited back within a week-ish.
12,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Need to hear better,I like themwire is too short. Keep coming out of my ears
12,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Questionable warranty,"Lexie B2. I am only a casual user of my hearing aids which I purchased from Amazon three months ago. The left ear stopped working. Lexie helped me diagnose the problem. The wire to the left ear was faulty. This wire is called an accessory and is not covered under the warranty. After paying $999 for the hearing aids, i am very upset that I have to pay another $50 to replace this wire."
12,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,No built-in hearing test,"I was stunned to find that the adjustments on the Lexi B2 is absolutely rudimentary compared to even cheap versions of other hearing aids. For example there is no hearing test that allows you to customize your hearing aids to your particular hearing loss. All there is is volume and tone controls. That's it. When they say you can adjust for different environments be advised, all that means is volume and tone. Unbelievable. Pairing is hit or miss. Mechanically, physically they're fine. Also the case is excessively large even though it contains no battery. That's right, you're hearing aids will not charge from the case alone, only when it's plugged in. Really cheesy for athousand bucks."
12,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Using hearing aids properly,So far I like them more than Rexon from Costo but I am still getting use to them .)my only questions are how do eliminate feed back and also certain sounds like when you touch dishes or silverware seems very loud I will call mfg to find out how to fine tune them Ed
12,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good quality,"They really help at church, and in conversations. The down side is that they try to connect to my iPad, and it doesn’t do a very good job of that. On the iPad the sound is static and not too clear. I tried to turn it off on the iPad, but I don’t seem to be able to do that.  Outside of the iPad problem, they are comfortable to wear and of excellent quality."
12,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Volume control keeps falling off,"This is the second pair of hearing aids I have returned  within 30 days and my money was refunded.  Each pair the volume switch fell off.  These were bought for my mother, and she did enjoy them. Comfort and sound was very good.  I found another brand that had a better looking switch for $200 more."
12,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,setup does not include programming,"Just fired them up and very disappointed with the setup.  After reading the JAMA study referenced in their literature, I expected a hearing test to program the devices like a hearing aid.  Instead I got an amplifier with a preset response curve and old-time stereo controls of volume, tone, and balance - not even an equalizer.  The environment settings, which I expected to be selected noise reduction algorithms added to my program, appear to be just different tone/volume combinations.  Had expected better from an iPhone ""accessory"".  I guess the message is they're ok if you have a normal pattern hearing loss, otherwise get your checkbook and head for the audiologist."
12,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Would work for a hearing loss that is more minor than mine.,"Because I had worn hearing aids for 20 years already, these were good but did not have the features I had become accustomed to and needed. I found the feedback when I tried to increase the volume for my needs untenable. I would recommend them for those who are newbies to hearing aids."
12,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth the cost,"These hearing aids and app are faulty. My hearing specialist did the setting up with me. She found the app confusing and could not find answers to her questions. They were difficult to pair with my phone, and the left side continually disconnected. Although the description said they could not take calls, it didn't say anything about music. The specialist had to call to get answers and customer service kept putting her on hold. First, the B2 MORE more than the ones that DO have calls and music capability.  Second, this is BOSE. What are they famous for - the very thing they don't offer with this set. Very disappointing and I'm returning them for a refund."
12,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Quality and price is good,"To be fair I am comparing these hearing aids wit the Phonix ones. There are only two adjustments than can be made: base volume and treble volume. For a Bose technology I would have expected noise cancelation to be much better which is rather important. The hearing aids don’t always connect to my iPhone 11. Of course, Phonix cost a lot more. I suppose I would have to say that price point and quality is about right.I also have to say customer service sucks. They will not returned my calls or messages so I can get the longer tubes they offer so the ear piece will fit in my ear"
12,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,I can finally hear,I’ve had hearing issues for 20+ years and was blown away with all the things I can hear now.  The only reason I didn’t give it a 5 is there is a super high pitch squeal from time to time like when microphones are close to each
12,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent Hearing Aids,"Very low cost and easy to use.  The App provides additional benefits allowing you to fine tune your hearing support. Difficult to use with glasses, and they make my ears stick out.  When you touch the behind the ear unit you get feedback."
12,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,"They work very well, with one exception","These units do improve hearing overall, the higher frequencies, however, aren’t the sharpest. For overall all performance I still prefer the Jabra hearing aids I returned. Those were exceptional, but so irritated my ears I couldn’t wear them. These are comfortable, and once the proper domes are selected work well all day long. The battery life is excellent, easily lasting at a useful level for an entire day. It does take some adjusting of the sound levels and bass and treble to get what works best for you. Overall I recommend these for anyone with moderate hearing difficulties."
12,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Decent OTC Hearing Aids. App Finally Updated!,"Update:After having a poor experience controlling the hearing aids with the phone app, I sent them back. But when Lexie called to tell me about the app upgrade, I took a chance and re-ordered them. Dramatic improvement!Prior Review:As my first hearing aids, I don't have anything to compare these to - but they definitely help my hearing! But the one notable downside is the IOS app. The app is used to control the hearing aids - tone, balance, volume, environment etc. can all be managed easily from the app. That is IF the app/phone connects to the hearing aids. I haven't kept close track, but I'd guess that a third of the time it fails. And if you need to make a change - you just stepped into a noisy restaurant - lack of access to the app is a problem. The app will make helpful suggestions like ""take them out and put them back in the case to reset."" I just got them in my ears and now I need to take them out again? I'm hoping they can get this sorted out, but I'm considering sending them back."
12,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Did not work as I hoped,"I bought these to replace a pair of very expensive hearing aids that I purchased from an audiology clinic. My hearing loss is described as moderate to substantial. One of the hearing aids I had, had ceased to function.  So I thought I would give these a try rather than spend hundreds of dollars to repair several year old hearing aids. While I was able to hear someone speak (with the volume at the highest setting), watching TV or other sounds were unintelligible. While they may work for some people, they did not work for me. It was worth a try."
12,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,They Help,They definitely help my overall hearing but they are more responsive to hard noises like setting a glass down or the dogs nails tapping on the floor or a door closing. Birds are a lot more pronounced. Not very pleasant outside in the wind and riding bicycles or boating is out. can be very annoying when you sweat. would really like to compare these to a prescribed pair.
12,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love these!,"I bought these for my fiancé’and he loves them! He hears the little things now and can even hear in crowded rooms. He loves the blue tooth, he can adjust the hearingaids on his phone by the type of environment he’s in. For the money, they’re amazing!⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️🌟"
12,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Really helpful for mild hearing loss,"I have self-diagnosed mild hearing loss.  I struggle to hear some tones in people's voices, especially children and some women.  I found myself saying 'huh' all the time to my kids and wife.  And, if we were in a loud place, you might as well not talk to me because it's hard to understand anything.  So, I figure I have mild hearing loss.These hearing aids have been so helpful.  Instead of saying 'huh' 100 times daily, I say it less than 5.  At restaurants, the movie theater, live theater, and everywhere else, I have found that these hearing aids help A LOT.  I would buy these over and over again.Here's my honest critique: the noise canceling is just okay.  And, these really struggle in the wind.  Maybe this is a common issue among hearing aids?  Also, I wish the Bluetooth connectivity was better, as it is buggy.100% I'd buy these again.  I probably will in a few years when the batteries give out.  If you think your self-diagnosed hearing loss is similar to mine, I highly recommend getting these, as they have truly improved my hearing ability."
12,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good solution,"I was a little apprehensive buying a hearing device with red and blue tips and one that has the manufacturer’s name printed on it. Surprising that these are much smaller than how they look in the picture - both are non issue.Sound quality is good - sound quality when using my phone, not so great.Charging case is large and there is no built in battery so the only way to charge is plugged into the wall.Overall I am happy with the quality and fit. Very small and the tubes worked perfect and hardly visible.No battery in the charging case and ‘tinny’ call quality, one star deduce"
12,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Not for moderate to severe hearing loss,"I purchased the Lexie B2 OTC Hearing Aids Powered by Bose hoping for a cheaper but quality hearing aid.  I liked the fit, and I liked the app to adjust on the go, but they barely work for me because I have more moderate to severe hearing loss. I had some family members try them to see what they thought about the volume, and they said the sound quality was awesome. Unfortunately I need something stronger. I definitely would recommend these to someone with minor to moderate hearing loss."
12,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Affordable Quality and Great Customer Service,"Received my hearing aids in about a day. They were easy to set up and fit. I have had them for about three weeks and they certainly do help substantially in conference rooms, or restaurants. I don't believe I have said ""sorry I didn't hear that, can you repeat"" since I have worn them. I did realize that the standard #2 wire size was a tad bit small. I reach out to customer service for the larger size, they picked up in less than a minute.  No hassle, no questions asked, they sent out a set of #3's free of charge. The only detractor would be the Bluetooth connection, I am not sure if this is normal or not but, the devices will not connect to the app after you first turn them on; you have to power them off, then on again to get them to connect. But I would say there really is no reason to adjust volume in the app once you have set them up. There is a volume control on each one."
12,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Lexie hearing aids,The Lexie hearing aids are easy to use and work pretty well.  They even called me shortly after I got them to see how it was going.  I wasn’t there to get the call.  Only issue seems to be the volume keeps changing when on the Indoors environment.  I need to ask them about it.
12,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,App is awful,"This is a follow up review after using the Lexie B2 Bose hearing aids for about  a week.The hardware works very well. Volume, right and left sound level, treble and bass as well as front only or 360 sounds are all adjustable with the app. Battery life is about 18 hrs as advertised before having to recharge. I now can watch TV with the volume set so itwrks for my wife. Without these hearing aids I had to set the TV volume significantly higher.But the app continues to be awful. Pairing is hit or miss. I am now using it without the left ear device paired. Tomorrow I may or may not get them both to pair.The system advertises a self-tune feature of the app which i assume sends you beeps at various loudness and frequencies that you acknowledge so it can adjust its parameters automatically with the app. But I have found no such capability.So, I give the hardware a 5 star rating and the app a single star. I hope they fix it and issue an update.Joan"
12,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,Expensive,"Somewhat expensive. Had good reviews. In spite of numerous calls to customer service. And an additional rip off purchase of $50 ear wires, they fall out of his ear canal."
12,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,"not as good as I had hoped, lot of static",wanted better volume control to much static
12,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent product!!!,Even though I had to return the hearing aids as my hearing lose is worse than I thought the hearing aids are excellent quality and technology. Wish they would have work for me. If you have mild to moderate hearing lose I would highly recommend.
12,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good sound quality,"When I was registering for my warranty, I entered in the serial number on the bottom of the charging case, no problem. Then you need to enter the right red ear piece serial number which impossible to read! The numbers are incredibly small. You would need a microscope to read it. The registration has to be easier!"
12,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Game-changer for my father,"Last year, I bought these Lexie B2 Hearing Aids for my dad, who'd been struggling for years to find the right ones. Long story short - We decided to give these a shot because they were more affordable. And you know what? They changed his life. He's thrilled to have the ability to customize and adjust them to his liking, even setting different modes for different environments. The only hiccup he faced was dealing with the batteries. Overall, these hearing aids have been a game-changer for him, and we're so glad we tried them out."
12,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Be sure they fit correctly for best results.,"Small and easy to use. Be sure they fit is correctly. The included instructions explain it well. The battery life is good for about 16-18 hours. The units I received seem to discharge at different rates. At the end of the day, the right ear unit is about 30 percent more discharged than the unit for the left ear. The convenient charging unit will recharge the hearing aid completely in about 3 hours. Overall, I am very satisfied with this purchase."
12,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product at the price,"I used Bose headphones for years and they worked well, so I had high hopes the Lexie B2 would be good.  All went well for a week or two but then my right hearing aid simply stopped working (I only use one on the right).  I kept phoning support from Australia but only got messages saying I had called out of hours, thought I had been ripped off and gave a one star review. Soon after I received a voice message from Lexie Support inquiring if all was well, called back, only had to wait 2 mins and a helpful lady solved my problem (a small speck of wax or skin in the receiver).  Really happy with the product, takes a little time to get used to the app etc but after a few weeks I find the hearing aid is fine, does the job, is not uncomfortable etc  I even dropped it by accident into a bowl of liquid in the sink, put a hair dryer on it and it still worked fine."
12,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Clean and clear hearing,"I tested these Bose hearing aids against a $5,000 pair for 4 weeks and chose these. I could not find any hearing advantage and nothing to justify the price of the Rx aids. These Bose aids from Lexie take the dull and flat speaking voices on radio and tv without aids and make them clean and distinct so I can now understand them. This is my 3rd pair of hearing aids in 15 years. The first two were $5,000 per pair. I bought the new Bose after loosing one of my last pair. So, I also tested these against my one remaining aid from the last pair and found the Bose a clear choice. Blue tooth and audio streaming work well. The batteries last 15-16 hours. Plus, in the test they were easier to put on and more comfortable. I called the help line once and got immediate help - no long wait. BTW when you increase volume on one, it increases on both. App works well."
12,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,left side stopped working,"For a while they seemed to be working OK. They are very directional, no matter the setting. My main problem is that the left one stopped working after a few months, but past the deadlines for support help. So at this point, my $900+ investment sees me using just the right one."
12,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,High quality and easy to use,"We replaced my husband’s old hearing aids. After spending several thousand dollars on the two preceding sets of aids, these met our needs completely.  They pair with the I Phone so my husband can hear calls clearly.  Batteries last all day.  They’ve never quit early.  Very satisfied with our purchase"
12,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Really nice,"These hearing aids are comfortable, easy to charge and I can hear well with them. Customer service amazing. They called me to see how they were working for me!!"
12,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,"No firmware upgrades, without sending back to vendor, no Testing/Auto-Adjust app.","I bought mine on the day they released the ""work with phone via bluetooth"" updated firmware.  Be sure to register, because then you have a 45-day trial period during which the update is free (actually, it probably is in all shipping devices by now) ...1) I just 'assumed' that firmware updates would occur via the Lexie B2 app; don't make the same assumption!2) Settings are adjustable for volume, noise & environment ... I would like to see the App have a 'testing' program that auto-sets the hearing aids (much like the Olive Union hearing aids), but sadly, this is not the case.$999 is a lot to spend for hearing aids without the 2 aforementioned capabilities.  I used HSA money, so I'm not so bothered ... and spending an additional $50 (again, HSA money) is a bit annoying for what should be easy, over-the-air (downloadable) firmware ... so: CAVEAT EMPTOR !"
12,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good for the Price,Battery life is excellent. They fit really well but I wear glasses so there is bit of an issue keeping them in place. This is not a ding against these hearing aids; none of them that have this design work well with glasses. The sound quality is so-so but the amplification is good. There are other hearing aids that do a much better job at filtering and enhancing sound with advanced electronics but they cost seven times more. My hearing loss borders on severe at certain frequencies which these units are not intended for but they do work for me for the most part.The description mentions streaming phone calls. They do stream calls but you have to remember that it uses the phone’s mic so you have to do the pop tart pose while talking. It also says it does not stream audio but it does at least on my iPhone. Either way the sound quality is pretty poor.I do wish there was one size larger tip to keep them inside my ear canal.Over all they are a great value and hearing loss is a factor in developing dementia so don’t suffer in silence. Pun intended.
12,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Hearing satisfaction.,Still early days but hoping that i will finally get the results I need.  To be continued……
12,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Works similarly to the Rx model that costs 5 times as much,"After recently confirming how much hearing loss I've sustained, I was given a pair of Rx-grade hearing aids by a local ENT provider.  I immediately loved their effect on my hearing, but the price tag was over $5k.These Lexie units are of a near-identical design of those Rx-grade units but were a fifth of the price.  I can't tell enough of a sound difference between them.  Very glad that these are available OTC and relatively affordable with HSA options.  The included option of open/passthrough tips is exactly what I was looking for and these amplify the higher frequencies that I needed assistance with.The app isn't always the most reliable to reconnect and there isn't much in the way of customization, but it's such a rare need to use it that I can't find it to be that bothersome.I'd give a full five stars if the very large and bulky case also provided charge with a built-in battery of its own, like practically every other ear bud out there.  But, it only passes through a charge when plugged in.  Considering the size of the case, especially compared to typical earbuds, I really can't believe that they can't shove a battery in there.  Or at least offer an optional slim case that's more pocket-friendly for those of us who may not need a geriatric-sized case."
12,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,So far so good.,"I have worn aids for ten years, starting with a pair from the audiologist for $3600. They were good except I had to drive 55 miles for any adjustment. I have tried several other types from the minis which were useless. I got a pair of Bose about 2 years ago and they were good but messing with the tiny batteries was a pain, but liked controlling from my phone.I tried couple of other pairs, but when I saw the Lexie B2, I was sold. I was with a group of friends over the weekend, and had trouble adjusting to the extraneous noise, but will have to figure out the settings for that."
12,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,GREAT HEARING AIDS BUT DEFECT,"THEY ARE GREAT HEARING AIDS FOR MY 84 YEAR OLD COUSIN, WHO I CARE FOR. THEY WORKED WELL FOR 7 WEEKS THEN WE NOTICED A DEFECT. THE RIGHT HEARING AID CAP OVER THE CONTROL BUTTON FELL OFF AND WE CAN'T FIND IT.  FOR A $1000 PRODUCT IT SHOULDN'T HAVE  FALLEN OFF THAT EASY. SEE PHOTO! THE COMPANY IS ALLOWING US TO SEND THEM BACK WITH A $15 CHARGE. THEY SAID IF FOUND DAMAGED THEY WON'T FIX THEM FREE, BUT IF IT'S A MANUFACTURER DEFECT THEN THEY WILL FIX THEM. THEY WORKED GOOD, JUST NO FUN USING A TOOTHPICK TO OPERATE THEM. NOW, WE ARE WITHOUT THEM UNTIL WHO KNOWS WHEN.  I WILL UPDATE YOU LATER AFTER THEY DECIDE TO STICK IT TO US OR NOT.🤣UPDATE:2-16-24- In November 2023, the company repaired the right hearing aid by replacing the cap over the control panel that fell off. Customer service was generous and expedited the repair quickly. Three months later in February 2024, that same cap over the control panel fell off for a 2nd time.  I have the cap and we did not loose it.  I contacted customer service again.  I have returned the hearing aids to the company for ongoing repairs, and waiting for results.  The left hearing aid has never had that problem. Only the right hearing aid has an ongoing problem with the cap falling off from over the control panel. I requested that the company please replace it since it's an ongoing problem. It appears to be a manufacturer defect since it keeps happening.WARNING: Customer service advised me that they won't replace it because I purchased my hearing aids from Amazon and NOT directly from their company. They will only make repairs on the ongoing problem that I have. Interesting that they will keep making repairs on the same identical problem. I have owned them for only 6 months. When the 1 year warranty is expired it appears that I will have to pay for any future repairs including if I continue to have the same problem. I hope anybody buying Lexie Hearing Aids reviews this. Yes, they do work good, if they don't break down."
12,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not easy to use,"I took an online hearing test and I bough Lexie B2 OTC Hearing Aid. It looked easy enough to use but it's not.They are hard to put on, sometimes the ear piece comes out so I constantly need to check if they are in place. The on button is so small so when they are already in place it's difficult to feel it to turn it on. You need to use it with your phone app to adjust the volume and you need to have your Bluetooth on before you can connect to the device. If it's not connecting you have to take them off put them back in the charger and then put them back in your ears and then turn them back on. It's a laborious process. My advice to anyone considering purchasing hearing aid is to test them first for comfort, ease of use and simple instructions."
12,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,Buyer Beware,"Knowing that I had some hearing loss, I took several online hearing tests that confirmed that I have moderate hearing loss.  I was aware that the FDA approved some OTC hearing aids in the fall of 2022 and after considerable research, I settled for these.  Received them one day after ordering and charged them overnight.  Following instructions, I fitted both aids in my ears and paired them to my iPhone 14 using their app.  Setup was a breeze and controls within the app were very straight forward.  I did notice that one device was showing a 100% charge and the other 95% charge but didn't see that as a red flag.  First day of use was just amazing.  Day two, one device showed 90% charge and the other a 100%.  Again, a red flag.  Day three, one device now only shows 85% charge while the other still at 100%  During my intial setup, registered for warrenty each device with its' unique serial# and was recquired to provided a screen shot of the orginial purchase invoice.....Lexie claimed they couldn't open in the format that I sent it in so took a picture of the invoice and texted it to them and was able to complete the registration process.  On day four, one device will not turn on [the one that would never fully charge] and no amount of trouble shooting would fix the problem.  I reached out to Lexie by chat but that was not avaiable so then called first in the Lexie app [it is a video chat connection] and after no response called their regular toll free #....no one ansered.  Then sent an email to customer service and no response.  All these efforts to connect with Lexie were mid week and mid day.  I gave up and returned them to Amazon for a full refund.  Very disappointed in the lack of response from Lexie customer service.  Two weeks after I first contacted Lexie by email, I still have not received a response."
12,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Good hearing aids.,I gave it 3 stars in Overall Rating because the right piece did not charge properly. I wanted to exchange it for a working one. I requested a call from product support but days went by and I did not get a call. so I called Amazon  Customer Service and their only suggestion was for me to return the whole item and reorder a new one. This would have been fine except that its going to take a month for me to receive credit for my payment. I am retired and on a fixed income and can not put out another $999.00 while I wait for the credit. Amazon really dropped the ball on this one.
12,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good craftsmanship,The manual is not very well written.
12,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Easy for my dad to use!,My dad has had trouble with his hearing aids purchased from his doctor.  After loosing one of those hearing aids we purchased these as they were significantly cheaper than the ones from the doctor and even Costco.  He is 73 and has trouble with technology but has figured out how to use the iPhone app and loves that he can adjust his aids all on his own.  He says they work better than any hearing aid he has had.
12,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Poor product,Two sets do not work. need assistance or replace
12,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,COMPARES INCREDIBLY WELL TO PRESCRIBED HEARING AIDS,"I had been extremely satisfied with my COSCO/Phonak hearing aids of the same configuration. Unfortunately I have a pup that has chosen to chew on my hearing aids...twice! I had beast insurance for the first incident and fortunately for him, he is very cute. There was going to be a nearly six week delay in getting an audiology examination for replacement. I had heard and seen good reviews for the OTC Bose Lexie hearing aids and I could get them from AMAZON in two days. Why not try them as they could be returned in 45 days if unsatisfactory. I immediately was able to tune them to very closely approximate the sound and screening quality of what I had been using and that was a huge surprise and plus. The app is however a bit cumbersome to use in making adjustments in different settings. Lexie says they are working on the problems that I have talked with the very easy to access customer service representatives who have been extremely knowledgeable, if the app is a negative, customer service is a big plus. I have had a problem with the speaker creeping from my ear hole. This was a huge negative until I read the last pages of the user manual which addressed this issue. I simply called great Lexie customer service and they sent me the longer size 3 speaker wires and problem solved. I am now approaching the 45 day deadline for return and have decided that they hearing aids meet my requirements as well as what I had been wearing. I have the ability to make a comparison and what I thought would be a stop gap is now the solution for my personal needs. The only real downside other than the gnarly app access is that I do not play audiobooks through these hearing aids and I discovered I can live without that especially if that very cute pup gets hold of another pair."
12,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Helps me hear.,I have had these for a few months.  They work pretty good.  I have had some feedback issue but for the most part they work the way they should.  I am pleased with them especially with the price.  My previous pair was $3900.
12,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,It’s a game changer,I love that it’s Bluetooth and affordable. I don’t like that it whistles when ever something comes near it. Also they pop out of my ears when I eat.
12,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,The extra features don’t make a big difference.,"I bought these after reviewing a lot of articles and reviews on line. The fact they are Bose and are rechargeable figured largely in my decision to buy these particular hearing aids.The instructions for set up and wearing them were pretty straightforward. You must be comfortable with downloading apps, cellphone navigation, and the ability to recognize it’s not you, it’s some poor designs that are irritating.Your fingers have to be nimble and strong enough to press tiny buttons to turn on the hearing aids.The ability to select “environments” like noisy room and outdoors seems like a good idea, but they don’t really make that much of a difference. You can create your own environment, but it’s not easy.  My sister gave me the best tip: set the volume and bass/treble to your preference and then leave it alone.I hate the fact I hear EVERYTHING x 10 such as my knees creaking, my neighbors doors closing, my ice maker sounds like Niagara FALLS. But my understanding is this is not unique to these hearing aids alone.So I’m left wondering if cheaper hearing aids would work as well as these?The 2 things I like best are 1) They are rechargeable (if the recharger is plugged into the wall. No battery to recharge otherwise) and 2) They work with your iphone so you can answer and talk, but no one can hear the other end of the conversation."
12,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great value!,"19-May-24 I will update this report as time passes, but after the first few days I can report:• The app works fine.• The batteries last about 18 hours per charge.• Consumables are similar to those of my old hearing aids.• It takes a bit of fiddling with settings to hear well in crowds, but once you get it, you can save the setting in the app.• Receiver tubes are available on the website. I might get an extra pair, since I have experienced availability problems after retail products are discontinued.• I called and spoke with an actual human.• The devices work great when making voice calls with my iPhone 12 mini."
12,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,My Husband can actually PARTICIPATE in our life now!,"My Husband lost 40% of his hearing due to  throat cancer and radiation treatments. Insurance wouldn’t cover the cost of hearing aids. So we did a lot of research and found these to be the most popular at the best price. (AT THE TIME. Continue reading for explanation.) Sound quality is GREAT!  A little difficult to adjust/keep tuned in to individual needs without having to contact customer support. But I think that was due to a “ Technology Deficit” on our part, and nothing to do with the devices themselves.However, they were friendly, Pront, courteous and knowledgeable! Very professional and willing to help my husband LEARN & OPERATE his new hearing devices in just ONE CALL. It has made a huge difference for him! Now HE’S HAPPY and realizes just how much he’s been missing!ONE DRAWBACK- two weeks AFTER we purchased these from Amazon, we just happened to be at Walgreens and their EVERYDAY price was $200.00 dollars CHEAPER. Big letdown.That being said, having my Husband respond to my voice in a timely manner, and me not having to repeat 80% of everything I say on a daily basis, is awesome! He is actually getting to hear the Grandkids laugh and play , and that is, well, as they say, PRICELESS!WOULD DEFINITELY BUY AGAIN! (But next time, I will  wait for a sales event)"
12,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Read Carefully,"I purchased Lexie Hearing AIDS 11/23. Within 3 weeks they were boxed up and returned. It’s now 1/15/24 and I finally received my refund, thank you Amazon Customer service.Okay here’s the deal….. The hearing aids worked well, I liked them. The problem that was a deal breaker for me was with the Bluetooth feature. The right side started early on losing its connection. At first deleting and reinstalling the app took care of the problem and then it wasn’t long and no matter what I tried I could not get connectivity for the right side. There are a multitude of ways to reboot this and that on my iPhone that can be tried but nothing helped. All of these actions are available by Googling hearing aid Bluetooth problems because this is a common occurrence with HA’s.Well while I’m troubleshooting this problem on my own I’m also trying to contact Lexie Customer Service. This was the final deal breaker (sorry I’m overusing that). Their lines are so backed up you can spend hours on hold, but you can also request a call back, which I did, and after three days of waiting I get a call at 7AM from CS. The gentleman, whose second language was possibly English, apologized for the inconvenience I was having for a total of 10 seconds and said that he would transfer me to tech support. Well guess what, I’m back on hold for 30 minutes before I disconnected and started the return process, enough of this nonsense.Okay so why did I give five stars? Simply stated, these hearing aids do what they are designed to do at a very reasonable price regardless of the problems with the Bluetooth."
12,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,"The hearing aids were not bad but not great, either","For the most part, the hearing aids helped my mom a little; but no matter what we did, we could not get the hearing aids to stop whistling.  I returned them and ended up buying a $5400 pair from a hearing aid specialist.  I hated to return them, but they couldn't do what I needed them to do. They would probably be fine for someone whose hearing loss isn't too bad."
12,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Price,"No problem hearing aids. Easy to charge, wear, install and remove. But now they're for sale 10% OFF! Everyone should who bought them should get $100 credit immediately."
12,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good hearing aids,"Lexie hearing aids are good. The only thing I’m not satisfied with is, I thought they had Bluetooth. Other than that,I’m satisfied with them."
12,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Waiting for the technology,"My hearing profile differs in each of my ears. Since volume only, not frequency or tone, can be adjusted in each individual hearing aid these didn't meet my need. Also they cannot be turned down low enough when the ambient noise requires. Like others have said, the app is also difficult and fidgety usually taking more time than I'd like even pairing both hearing aids to bluetooth.Other than that I found the customer service to be helpful, but inconsistent. Thanks Lexie, but for the money you will have to do a lot better than that."
12,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great for mild to moderate loss,"I am in my mid 40s and recently diagnosed with moderate cookie bite hearing loss ( frequencies in midrange for speech ). I returned the expensive hearing aids due to lack of comfort and constant scrubbing sound of microphone . And the $$$! So far these are comfortable and there is no feedback or overly sensitive microphone.The Lexie does offer the ability to customize volume setting and treble /bass, but, not actual Hz frequencies ( 500, 1000, 2000). So far I think these are great for the price ! I look forward to seeing if I can hear better in social situations ."
12,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Not too bad... but.,Well have only been using and playing with them for a few days... and... they are comfortable... they do amplify sound.... but... with only a single tone control anything in the TREBLE range causes the sound sounds Tinney.... anything in the Bass range seems to reduce volume... for me. Balance controll is useful but I would rather have seperate volume ...controls... and more of an equalizer type control for sound range. Hopefully the SOFTWARE controls will change.... because I like them!
12,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Hearing aids,"I had bought a less expensive set of hearing aids about 2 years ago with no external adjustments. They did not help my very poor hearing, in my left ear. There is nothing out there that can cure my hearing loss but the Lexie hearing aids make it so much better. Even a simple conversation during dinner out I can adjust the sound level with my phone and stay tuned into the conversation."
12,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great quality and outstanding service,"I bought these for my wife, as the Lexie B2 was highly rated.  She went through the usual frustration of a learning curve, but pops them in her ears easily now.  The instruction book is clear and has excellent pictures.  Making adjustments by smartphone is easy and works beautifully.  The only problem was operator error.  After minimal use, my wife could not hear from one hearing aid.  She called the service center and was walked through many steps to find the problem. The solution was simple-clean the earpiece.  A few days later, the problem recurred.  Another call helped us to learn that we also had to clean the wax filter.  Both service people were outstanding and incredibly patient.  There has been no problem since we have started cleaning the wax filter regularly.  My wife recommends the Lexie B2 highly."
12,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,Lots of feedback whistling,"Has some great features and I like the charging station with the lid. But, poor sound quality when linking with telephone and lots of feedback whistling."
12,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product for seniors,"These seem to work for our seniors and they love them, being able to hear and interact with others as well as watching tv or listening to the radio."
179,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are great.,"These are the 4th set of hearing aids that I have tried. They are by far the most comfortable, the sound is very clear & the charge lasts a long time. All at a good price."
179,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,"clear voice audio, small size, comfortable to wear, simple to use",minimalist design delivers exactly what is needed for mild to moderate reduced hearing - ideal for the person who just needs a boost of clear ambient speech and sound without the need for pairing with distracting external (bluetooth) device(s).battery life and the range of sizes and types of domes supplied ensured all-day comfortable experience
179,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,these new Linner Venus OTC hearing aides are great for my mild hearing loss,"These OTC hearing aides were real easy to use without and screeching and I noticed a difference in my hearing right away.  Battery life is Great!  Easy to change volume!  I wish it was a little easier to change Mode, because I seem to always change the volume.  I have tried OTC hearing aides and these are great for the Value!"
179,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Fast Delivery of Product,"These OTC hearing aids are very comfortable to wear. I like the concept and are very easy to operate, I really like the “pocket” charging case. They provide many ear tip options which I found as a great benefit as well. However, I am experiencing “cut-outs” which is annoying me. I cleaned out my ears to remove ear wax which helped a little with the cut out but this never happened with my other OTC hearing aids which over time have failed me, as for my reason for purchasing these Linner Venus  CIC devices. I also don’t get to use the open tips which I like, as I don’t sound like I’m in a ‘tin can’ when I talk, I get way to much feed back noise and the volume is not even up to where I need it to be. Oh, I think I should mention that I have moderate hearing loss and when these are not cutting out, they work very well. I will test them out for a few days and see if “things” work themselves out….Update, I had to send em back, the cutting out was driving me crazy and everytime I tried to readjust I would change the volume or mode settings. They may work well for others but I think that I require BTE aids in lieu of this kind of in the ear bud devices…"
179,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,These hearing aids are clear and loud,I have purchased four different sets of hearing aids from Linner and they are all excellent products.They come with excellent packaging that has very informative information.  These are excellent hearing aids that are inexpensive and they bring on sound that is loud enough to cover my hearing loss and they provide top notch clear sound so I know what is being said.  I recommend these hearing aids to those who need a little more power and clarity!
179,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Very Small and Extremely Comfortable -- Extremely Loud!,"These are the loudest hearing aids I have ever used and I've tried many. Beware though  all frequency ranges are boosted, so it's a little overwhelming, as most people only need a high frequency boost, but I'm extremely impressed. They are small and stay in your ears quite as well.  They seem to be extremely well made and durable, but I had to return mine as I did not need all frequencies boosted, just the upper range."
179,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,LINNER Venus Hearing Aid,"I have been wearing the LINNER Venus Hearing aids for several weeks. When I first open the box I was amazed on how many domes there were.  That was a pleasant surprise, because the best fit is so important. Once I located the size that was perfect for me I was on my way.I was able to adjust the sounds that I can say is crystal clear.  The Aids are very easy to adjust.  I have found them very comfortable.The batteries last all day.  Which is such a plus and the charger is there if you need it."
179,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great hearing aids,"These hearing aids are great! They are so light you don't feel them in your ears. The sound quality is fantastic! When I put these in for the first time it was a whole new world like when I put my glasses on for the first time. I didn't realize how much I was missing. I would definitely recommend. I would have given this product 5 stars except it doesn't have Bluetooth capabilities like my Linner Nova Lite ones do. Other than that, these are better than those."
179,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,"no big complaints so far as a first-timer, I'll keep trying to use them","I have minor hearing loss from being a drummer and attending concerts. I only seem to have trouble hearing someone talk when there are other distracting noises around, such as in a bar setting. I tried another set of OTC hearing aids and decided they weren't for me because I could hear every noise, and they were behind-the-ear which I didn't like. While I can still hear a lot of extraneous noises with these hearing aids, I more quickly got used to it and think it was less distracting because I could turn the volume down. So far I'm able to hear the TV well, though I've never had trouble with that anyhow. When walking around I can hear various noises that I need to learn to ""tune out"" of my head. Having conversations with my daughter was frustrating at the lowest volume and I had to increase to volume 3 before I could hear her speaking (she has an extremely timid & quiet voice). The problem is that at volume 3 then I could hear the dishwasher running in the background and can hear my own breathing amplified. I feel like there was a constant faint static noise I was hearing, but I quickly got used to that and ""tuned it out"". I have yet to test out the scenario that prompted me to get these, which is to use them in a noise setting where I struggle to hear my wife. For now I'm giving 4 stars because they're relatively comfortable like wearing earphones, though I can't imagine wearing these all day long. This is my review after day one, and hope to update again after a few weeks."
179,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Decent Hearing Amplifier,"I got these to use as spares in case my regular prescription hearing aids go out on me for any reason. I've had that happen--usually when I'm traveling--and these hearing amplifiers are small enough to fit easily in my backpack or even pocket. Note that I'm saying ""hearing amplifier"" instead of hearing aid because that's an important difference. With my prescription hearing aids, they are programmed by an audiologist to help my specific hearing loss needs. These amplifiers aren't programmed, so they just amplify sounds, and that is all sounds and not just those frequencies that I need help to hear. So sounds in frequencies that I still hear, for example the crunchy sound made by dead leaves when I'm walking through the woods are amplified louder than I really need if I have them turned up enough to hear speech. That's just an example. Given those parameters however, they do work well as backups. They are a little large for my hearing canal so I have to constantly adjust/reseat them in my ears especially after eating, but they are not uncomfortable to wear. They come with a wide range--and I mean a lot--of various ear tips so I could find the exact ones that worked best for me. I have issues hearing low frequencies so I picked out the closed dome ear tips as they tend to keep low sounds from ""leaking out of my ears"" and so that I could hear them better. But I do swap them out for the open/vented ones on hot days so the sweat doesn't pool up too badly in my ears. There are even super tiny ear tips/domes for those with narrow ear canals, although with the shape of the amplifiers themselves which is fairly large, having such small tips seems to be gliding towards the useless spectrum. But they are there for those who need them.The hearing amplifiers themselves really amplify sounds quite well, but I wish they would have a better indication of which mode they are in because I often get confused and have to cycle through the modes (which is done by long pressing the hearing amplifier) to find a suitable one. The battery life is actually pretty good and lasts me at least 8 hours or more. Their recharging case is tiny and uses a standard USB C connection to charge which is a relief since all my stuff uses USB C so I only need one cable.When I first noticed that my hearing needed assistance, I went with hearing amplifiers and I personally found this to be a good entry into the world of assisted hearing because it taught me what I liked, didn't like, what helped, and what didn't help. It was a cheaper way to begin learning. These hearing amplifiers would be excellent (and would have been excellent) as an intro or even a solution for folks who have never worn hearing amplifiers or aids and want to try something. I'd say they are decent for mild to moderate hearing loss but not if you're smack-dab in the middle of moderate hearing loss. Once you reach that level, you really need to look at something that can be tailored to your hearing loss prescription. I wish I'd had these however as my ""intro"" as I think they would have worked well for me for the first couple of years. (My first exposure to hearing amplification was 6 years ago.)I really like their little case and how easy it is to take them with me.  And like I said, they are good even for me (I have moderate to severe hearing loss) when my regular hearing aids go out on me. They are a perfect backup system."

179,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Watching TV with my wife just got easier,"I've tried a couple of other OTC hearing aids with little success.  These LINNER hearing aids actually work.  The primary time I want/need hearing aids is when my wife & I are watching TV.  Her hearing is great, mine ain't.  In order for me to hear the TV it has to be up pretty loud which bothers her.  With these hearing aids I can actually set the volume lower than she wants it.  The hearing aids are small, discrete and easy to use.  I'm looking forward to trying 'em in the ""restaurant"" setting as I also have problems deciphering individual voices in crowded/noisy situations.  The best OTC hearing aids I've used."
179,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome earbuds,Great sound and battery life
179,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,they're for mild loss of hearing only,"these are good amplifiers as they look and feel professionally made, nothing rings cheap quality about them on first impression but they are only meant for someone with very mild hearing loss. the sound comes through them excellent and it picks up on noise that is more often wanted than not and i like the recharging capability."
179,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Horrible,"By coincidence I received two different hearing aids on the same day, this one from LINNER, and this other one from DESRON:https://a.co/d/i1UdNaAThey are similar with some minor differences but both so horrible that I don't recommend either.I tried each at my desk with the TV on about 10 feet away at a low but audible volume.  I was curious to see if the hearing aids would amplify the sound of the TV: both sets made the TV sound like extremely faint and tinny, like the sound a robot might emit on the moon as it ran out of battery power.On the other hand, I could really hear myself when I breathed through my nose, or smacked my lips.This LINNER pair has much better documentation but as I was tested them they somehow got caught in a feedback loop and began to emit a loud, high-pitched sound.  No thank you."

179,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good amplification,"These came in very nice packaging with instructions. They were already charged. The color was supposed to be “blue’ but arrived in black (no big deal). They look like I have earbuds in - people might not realize that these are hearing aids. I have never used hearing aids, so this is a first for me and I’m not sure what to expect. I didn’t like that when I was putting them in my ears - just by touching them, it caused volume changes which produces a loud whistling/screeching sound from these (ouch!). I am still learning how to use them & control the volume. These do amplify the sound, but the quality is tinny. They do help, especially when watching TV with someone who doesn’t need/want it as loud as I do. I just have mild hearing loss, so some difficulty hearing certain pitches and words - enough that I need more volume to hear/understand EVERY word and not miss out on the entire sentence. So these do amplify sounds. I haven’t used them long enough to know what the battery life is. I’ve only used them a couple of times and I still haven’t needed to charge them yet."
179,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Inconsistent,"I was supplied with these for Beta testing. I already had Linner Nova's which I like very much. I like the size and battery life of the Venus model but can't seem to get consistent amplification from them. I have tried all the domes and they seem to fit well. Unfortunately, they don't have a Bluetooth app connection for volume or physical setting so when I press for higher volume there is no indication of what the setting is. They seem to work for others so maybe just won't match to my ear canals. Will keep trying and will update review if I can get consistent amplification."
179,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Decent hearing amplifier,"I don’t have really bad hearing loss yet, but i do find it harder to hear people than i used to, and i think it’s not a bad enough problem to go and get the real expensive thousands of dollars hearing aids yet. These are my first amplifiers I have tried, and I’m pleased so far. They do come beautifully boxed, and to look at them, you’d think it was a pair of black AirPods, so they aren’t embarrassing to wear at all. They definitely amplify voices very well for me, and the battery lasts all day. It comes with the charging cord, and a bunch of different tips so you get a good fit for your ear. They have easy to understand instructions, and controls. A pretty good set I’d say."
179,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good for hearing conversations,These are good for hearing conversations but not other sounds. Sounds in the room sound muffled compared to actual conversations.
179,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not for severe hearing loss,"In the description it says for severe hearing loss, it's definitely not, I can't hear anything out of them, would be a good value for someone who could hear out of them id imagine"
179,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,helping me hear better affordably,I have mild nerve damage in my ears and have purchased 1600.00 hearing aids ( that was my deductible) from my local hearing store but let me tell you I ordered this set of OTC hearing Aids that are much more affordable and I am truly happier with them than the ones the insurance company paid partially for. the sounds quality is excellent and they fit my ears so much better they are smaller and do not have the over the ear part that is always getting knocked off by my glasses. I really wish I had tried these before spending all that money but I am very happy I found these and will not make the same mistake twice.
179,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Working good,"The sound quality is very clear, and the comfort fit makes wearing tgem very comfortable. Plus, the smart controls are a nice touch for easy adjustments. So it’s very simple to use once you get the hang of it. The wireless mic for watching TV is really convenient.Overall the comfort, quality and convenience make them great"
179,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Hearing aids are person specific,"This  review is for the “ LINNER Venus High-Fidelity OTC Hearing Aids - Crystal-Clear Sound, Comfort Fit”. Hearing aids are a very personal accessory. Their performance, fit and longevity depend completely on the wearer. the most important feature for me is that they fit comfortably without slipping, without pressure and without back noise or screeching. This is my third set of hearing aids. I am by far no expert. let me talk a bit about my impressions with the Linner hearing aids.When I opened them I was not thrilled to see blackish blue hearing aids, I wish there would have been the 3 color options that are available now in the listing and include white or beige which I would have preferred. There is the perception of other people that hearing aid wearers need to  be talked very loudly to… and blue and black stick out.  and if you wear earbuds and get talked to, people expect you to take one out.These are kind of big knobby things, no wonder the listing has no pictures that shows them being worn. The  people in the picture have none in their ears.My main goal was to wear them going out and watching TV. They have 3 main modes: dialogue; restaurant and commute.You have to long press to switch between modes.They do surprisingly fit well and feel almost very comfortable for several hours. But…I hear myself breathing. And this overpowers many of the other sounds I do want and need to hear.I am not at the 30 day suggested use time yet, hovering around 20 as of today. I will give them another 10-14 days and if I get used to them better or more I will update this review.For starter hearing aids  for mild hearing loss these are reasonably priced at the $200 mark. Like i mentioned before hearing aids are a very personal choice, you just need to try until you find the perfect set for yourself."
179,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Comfortable hearing aids that are fairly easy to control (with some practice),"These hearing aids are decent amplifiers for the money. WIth the multiple sizes of tips included, it was easy to get a configuration that I found fairly comfortable. Charging is easy, just place the earpieces into the charging/storage container and they charge automatically. Top off the charging container every couple of days and you're good to go.  The controls did take a bit of getting used to, but I found changing the mode and the volume to be easy once I had gotten the hang of it."
179,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Crystal-Clear Days Ahead,"Jumping into the world of hearing aids felt like exploring uncharted waters, but the Venus High-Fidelity OTC Hearing Aids turned out to be my trusty compass. The sound clarity is astounding – I’m catching every detail, from whispers to symphonies, like never before. And with the smart noise reduction, I’m part of every conversation, even in bustling settings.The fit? Like a dream. These discreet little gems tuck in and stay put, so comfortably that I've almost hopped in the shower forgetting they're there! The easy controls mean I'm adjusting settings like a pro, no tech-savvy needed.But the real treat? The wireless mic for TV watching. I can enjoy my shows at my volume, and family movie nights are peaceful once again.In short, if you’re hovering over the 'buy' button, go for it. These hearing aids have not only amplified sounds but also the quality of my daily life. And, hey, they come in a snazzy blue – a fun little secret only you and I know about."
179,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very good,"A great set of hearing aids that are easy to use with a sharp design. I love the long-lasting battery, which avoids frequent charging like my previous aids. Unlike other hearing aids, it is also designed for enhanced usability. The sound quality can be a significant positive factor, which is why I'm giving it five stars. It can adapt to TV and car audio with three modes accessible by a button. Additionally, it is comfortable for long hours, and the sensitivity of the aids is reactive."
179,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great backup for the original hearing aids,"I got this for my dad who is in his 70s dealing with hearing issues. He said that these amplifiers have been a great addition to the regular tuned ones. He kept them handy as backups for the regular prescription aids, especially when on the go. While they're not custom-programmed like the main ones, they do a decent job of amplifying sounds. The only main complaint he had was that they tend to amplify all sounds, not just the ones he needs help with. Despite that, they're comfortable to wear,particularly because of the closed dome tips for blocking out low frequencies and the small charging case, which is easy to carry around. The battery life is impressive, lasting at least 8 hours or more, and the USB C charging port is a convenient feature. Overall, they've been a handy backup solution, especially for someone like him with moderate hearing loss."
179,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice amplifiers,These sound amplifiers are about the size of an average size of wireless earbuds. They're discreet to wear and don't look like a typical hearing aid. There are plenty of ear tips to provide a precise fit in the ear. The sound quality is good. They definitely amplify sound while cutting down on some unwanted noise. All in all they are a nice pair of amplifiers for mild hearing loss.
179,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,don't want to be without anymore,"I never realized how much I am missing in life without hearing aids. Thanks for making such a great product, and for making them affordable.  I would totally recommend these to anybody. Don't want to be without them anymore."
179,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,First time user,"I have had some issues with hearing loss, but it's not enough to justify the cost of doctors and hearing aids and the like since I can get through the day and most of my coworkers have learned they need to repeat themselves every now and then or stop talking while they are facing away from me. When I saw these on the vine program, I decided I would try it out. I like that they look like ear buds, so it doesn't make me self-conscious about wearing them in public. They have a bunch of different tips depending on what you need them for. They last long enough to get through the day. Overall, I'm really impressed with these, especially when as a first-time user the price tag makes me want to faint. I don't know how these compare to other hearing amplifiers so I can't comment on that aspect. How I end up liking these will all depend on how long they last. If they last a few years at $200, then I will consider it a successful product."
179,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Clear Sound,"I have tried other OTC hearing aids and they were like echo chambers and had squealing feedback. Granted they were half the price, but these hearing aids do NOT have those issues. Get what you pay for I guess. Lesson is, pay a bit more, like $200 instead of $100, and get something that will work out for you.These look like ear buds too and not like the hang over the ear hearing aids. People will think that these are ear buds for those of you who may be self-conscious about wearing hearing aids.Definitely recommended!"
179,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Easy Controls, Clear Sound, Comfortable","This review is for a Venus High-Fidelity Hearing Aids, with smart controls.  I have tried a couple of different hearing aids and amplifiers, and these are the best so far.  My problem with a lot of other aids was they amplified everything including my hair brushing back and forth.  I did not have that issue with these, the sound was great, and I didn’t hear anything else but what I was listening for.  I have small ears and they fit comfortably, the settings were easy to control with a tap of my finger, they were charged out of the box, but I still charged them fully before using for extended use.  I’m very happy with these aids and recommend them."
179,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Fantastic hearing aids -- comfortable, easy to use, easy to recharge","Got these for the eldest member of our household who had one hearing aid completely stop working recently. Well, he LOVES these, they're tiny compared to his old ones, they work better, they're more comfortable and are easy to adjust and he can recharge them while he's sleeping instead of having to put new batteries in every so often--he really likes that since it was a minor pain to change batteries. Pop says voices are clearer than ever and TV is more enjoyable now that he can clearly make out what's being said. Very, very pleased with these, hope they last a long time."
179,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are a must have for me,"I am highly impressed so far with these “ LINNER Venus High-Fidelity OTC Hearing Aids - Crystal-Clear Sound, Comfort Fit, and Smart Controls for Enhanced Hearing，Hearing Aids With Wireless Mic For Watching Tv For People With Hearing Loss (Blue). They are small and discreet which is great, they have helped so much with hearing conversations around me without having to deal with all the background noise, very easy to use, I can now sit and watch tv without having to keep it turned up blasting annoying others in the home, and the price is well worth the money for their great performance so I am loving them so far."
179,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good quality hearing amplifiers,"These hearing amplifiers are meant for people who have minor to moderate hearing impairment. The sound quality is really good comparing to my old ones. These are small and discreet, and much more comfortable to wear. The sound level is easy to adjust with much less background noises. I am having a very good experienced so far with it and hope it will last."

122,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product and support for the price!,"I had been trying to find hearing aids that I could program myself on an Android phone, answer and talk without taking my phone out of my pocket, and stream from my phone or computer via Bluetooth.I did an evaluation on some $2,600 ones from Costco, but I found that they work better on an iPhone, and you need an Apple device to program them. I could answer and hear, but had to pull my phone from my pocked since I could only talk back using my Android phone mic.  Also, streaming through hearing aids give very poor quality.Mostly, I really only needed hearing aids to hear other people so I decided to:1) Get a Samsung smart watch to answer and talk while my phone is in my pocket or another room.2) Forget hearing aid streaming and just use headphones for MUCH better sound quality.3) Get hearing aids that use an Android phone app so I can program it myself.For such a reasonably price, I was pleasantly surprised to find these to be have good enough quality to hear, understand conversations, and also have great tech support.Being a retired IT guy, I wanted to test my own hearing, program and make adjustments myself.Since the Blaids Mobile App has a hearing test and controls, I don't need an audiologist to do the testing & make adjustments. You create your own audiogrhams with the tests, and upload yours or an audiogram made from a professional (however, Costco could only give me a printed version of the one they made).I never  wear hearing aids with headphones on my PC, but I found on-the-ear headphones fit nicely below the hearing aid mic without feedback, and I can hear my wife, room noise, not to be confused :-), and PC at the same time. Now she doesn't have to flick the lights to get my attention. She likes it.Support is VERY responsive, and they help you through the issue until it is solved. On more than one occasion, the support manager quickly responded to my messages at ~10:30 pm his time, don't know when he sleeps.While these don't have the build quality and all the features of the ones I had been paying $6k for in the past, they are very adequate for the tasks, and I was surprised at the quality of the hearing aids, support and app features at this price.P. S. I have an odd shaped right ear canal and was having some difficulty with the right tube staying in. My previous hearings aids used wires and fit better. I'm sure support could have solved the issue, but after discussing the differences and benefits of an upgrade to BlaidsX Neuro Rechargable RIC I have decided to upgrade. I like them even better!Note: If you are a Vet you may get a military discount if you buy from Blaids directly, but not from AMZ."
122,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Only programmable very affordable hearing aid,"I lost my fancy left  $2500 hearing aid somewhere along 89 S. or 91 N, when it popped out of my ear.  The expensive hearing aid was a nationally recognized brand out of warranty, and with a customer service department that treated me like dirt. The lost hearing aid  had fancy cellular tracking on a map, but the battery died, and I couldn’t find the darn thing. I needed a fast solution for a left hearing aid, since my current insurance didn’t pay for hearing aids it needed to be affordable! So I looked on Amazon and found Blaids.The Blaids hearing aid  (left ear) was much better than the expensive hospital hearing aid (right ear) for me in that I can put in a current audiogram I take at home using the app.  My hearing changes on a biweekly cycle and renders my expensive hearing aid (right ear) as mediocre half the time! The expensive “industry hearing aid” also required a Hospital audiogram, and a doctors visit, and a second visit to an audiologist just to make an adjustment. This cost hundreds of dollars whenever I need it to make an adjustment, and took months to plan. This was not the case with the Blaids  hearing aid! It was the opposite!It  is amazing to have a hearing aid that I can program and adjust frequently in the comfort of my own home, in real time, without breaking the bank! At something like one eighth of the cost of the industry hearing aid, they were substantially better than I anticipated! The company keeps improving, the quality of the features like adjustable volume of its beeping , and a pallet of personalization options, in addition to having four professionally organized modes for general use, outdoors, indoors and TV. It is comfortable and effective, and I would definitely buy it again.A great bonus of Blaids, is that a live human, Brian, picked up the phone.  Unlike most corporations, Blaids didn’t waste my time on annoying phone trees, and robots that don’t understand anything I say. Brian knows the product and answered  all of my questions.I did not find the quality of the sound  of Blaids to be equal to the super expensive hearing aid that I list (eight times the cost), but it was pretty darn good, and better with all the advantages of being adjustable and programmable, and with a friendly customer service to help.  This product was a really good option for me, and exceeded my expectations in many ways. I would definitely buy this product, from this company,  again in a heartbeat."
122,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Does not appear to be as advertised,"UPDATED! SEE BELOW  I recently purchased a pair of Blaids X Pro hearing aids from Amazon. I have at least two problems with them.First, the left one doesn't work. I can hear the beeping sound when changing modes, such as from everyday to TV, suggesting that the path from  the hearing aid's electronics to my ear is ok. But I can't hear any external sounds, as if the microphone isn't working. I've tried all the controls available to me via the app, but nothing makes sounds come through the hearing aid.Second, they do not appear as advertised. ""BlaidsX Pro Programmable Hearing Aids for Adults with Mobile App Hearing Test & Noise Cancellation, Hearing Aids for Seniors with Bluetooth, Dual Mic & 48 DSP Channels"", as it appears on Amazon, where I purchased them, appears to indicate that 48 channels are adjustable with the mobile app. Nowhere on the web page where they are sold does it indicate a far more limited number of ""channels"" the user can adjust. I think that is grossly misrepresenting what users can actually control.Also, perhaps as a part of the first problem, the battery in the left hearing aid lasts less than half as long as in the right one even though it is the right one that I need the most volume on.We'll see how customer support responds.UPDATE: You've heard or used the term ""like pulling teeth"" to indicate something was difficult, maybe a bit painful, but ultimately successful. Well, dealing with this outfit was more like a botched root canal; time-consuming, painful, and unsuccessful. I started by telling them I'd like to return the hearing aids. They were determined to not let that happen. I sent one back (it quit working, just about 35 days old), and they either repaired it or replaced it, but no luck on return for refund. I'm very dissatisfied with them. I recommend going somewhere else. If you decide to get these, good luck with your root canal."
122,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Cuts in and out and loses Bluetooth connectivity,"This was my first attempt at wearing a hearing aid. I returned the first hearing aid because it would randomly cut off and turn back on every 10 seconds or so either at a certain point in the battery life or during certain background noises, not sure which. It was quite annoying. It also often failed to connect to the app via Bluetooth. I bought it again in hopes that the second one would be different, but so far it unfortunately seems identical. I still have yet to receive a refund for the first one I returned.UPDATE…Called their helpline and Brian was very concerned about my issues and promised to make it right. Hoping for a positive outcome. Will update with final results.Update…Turns out that my issue was resolved by not allowing the app to run in the background on my phone. Hopefully they can fix that issue with a software update in the future. For now everything works great if I simply do that one thing. The only other issue is that I don’t trust that these are truly IP-67 water resistant as stated on Amazon. My hearing aid got slightly damp and stopped working for a day. IP-67 should be able to be submerged in 1 meter of water for up to 30 minutes. Happy that it started working again after drying out. Otherwise I have been very satisfied with the hearing aid especially at this price point!"
122,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent unit,"Best hearing aid I have used for mild hearing loss. The app gives you a hearing test and the aid adjusts to your needs and what frequencies you are missing . In addition you can increase the volume. I do not hear background noises loudly as I did with all other aids that were amplifiers only. Background noises are simply more defined without being loud.I swam with the unit by accident and it dried and worked fine. Also it is comfortable for 16 hours and even comfortable while napping. I can finally hear low pitched voices without saying ""What?"" SOW my family is grateful."
122,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Inexpensive, works well BUT...","Too often these hearing aids get ""squelchy""... a whistle soumd of tweeting sound despite every possible adjustment i could find via wifi connex.  Also, changing mini batteries almost daily is a pain in the ass...these should be USB rechargeable.  Havinh ssid that, the price is FAR LESS than brands I tried out at the hearing center here in Ocala ( but those devices had NO squelching sounds!).  As always, you get what you pay for but in our case we cant afford those $7,000 Hearing Center usb hearing aids.  Feel like im between a "" rock & a hard place"" and cant get adequate hearing aids.  @$!%*&$@?!."
122,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,The good and not so good,"I've been on a search for awhile for a quality OTC hearing aid.  For full disclosure I knew a BTE style might not work out for as my left ear is very close to my head.  I thought I'd give these a try as the price point was very attractive.The good:  The hearing aids were boxed quite nicely and arrived promptly.  All accessories were included including batteries.  Batteries were easy to install and the hearing aids paired easily using the mobile app (iPhone).  The first problem I faced was the sound tube was too short for me but a larger set was included.  Unscrewing the tubes and swapping them out was a bit troublesome but not impossible.  Note the tubes are pretty solid and not flexible like more expensive or prescription models.The just OK:  The app (AcoSound) was easy to set up and start with the initial hearing test.  Note, the maker states the product is USA made but the app is made by Hangzhou AcoSound Technology, Co. LTD.  That aside, the app is very intuitive and works well.  The initial hearing test took about 5-6 minutes; however, the results seemed a bit light for my needs and I did the test a couple of times.  Unfortunately the higher frequency setting were nowhere near my audiogram but I didn't have a copy on hand to upload.  It does support that which is nice but I wouldn't rely solely on the app hearing test.  Get your printed result if you can.  You can also fine tune the settings by hand which is impressive.  Once that was done, the experience was far better.The not so good:  The only knock on the app is that it's slow to start up and pair when needed if you want to make a setting change or volume adjustment on the fly.  You can use the buttons but have to set that individually.  As far as fitment, the sound tubes have ear locks included on them which helps prevent them from falling out.  Unfortunately the right one wouldn't lock behind the cartilage in my outer ear, leaving a little plastic antenna sticking out of my ear.  I would have ordered another and sure the company would accomodate but didn't want to contact them, wait for a replacement to possibly just have the same experience.  I'd just cut the lock off and go without.  Additionally, my primary goal was to get a thinner style BTE to accomodate my weird ear shape and the pictures looked like they'd fit the bill but the unit was a bit thicker than the rearview photo represents.Overall, this is a very good hearing aid for users on a budget looking for a BTE device with normal ears (unlike mine apparently).  Sound quality is pretty good, but it's not a Sony or Signia but maybe it could be with a lot of fine tuning and patience.  Unfortunatley, due to my ear shape and comfort level, I wound up sending them back but wanted to be fair in my review.  All things considered, I'd give it a thumbs up and give them a try.  Maybe if they come out with a narrower unit, I'd try another."
122,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best customer service ever!,"Ive had these for about 10 days now.  They are very light weight, easy to wear, online hearing test for both ears is available, and the customer service alone would make me buy these again.  These have a very useful app to adjust the sound to four different environments, and you can control each ear individually  from the app.  If you need assistance, just call the number on the box and you get a live person to assist you with any adjustment problems you have.  They give you call back phone calls after an online help session ....the agents seem genuinely interested in helping you get the best performance from their hearing aids.  These also come with a complete two year warranty.  So far they are performing better than the pair of aids that I purchased 4 years ago and spent over $5000,00 on the pair.  These are working great for me so far and am so impressed with the customer support team. Try for 45 days , and if you don't like them they are refundable.  I am a happy customer of Blaids hearing aids."
122,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Had to return hearing aids,"I am returning the hearing aids because they do not address the Tinnitus problem that I have.  I did speak to Mae in Customer Service and she spent a long time with me trying to get the aids to work for me.  Unfortunately, the Tinnitus was worse when I was wearing the aids.  They did appear to have good sound and other than confusion about the right versus left ear, I think they would work fine for seniors without Tinnitus.  Very good customer service.  Just wish it could have worked out for me.  Should add the Tinnitus to the website description for other purchasers."
122,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great American made Product, Price & Service beats the big cartels a 1000 times over!","Prior to this purchase, I wore amplifiers I had purchased from Amazon. They did the trick for over two years.Being a retired accountant, I track everything to the 'nth' degree.  Please note: I spent most of 2023, asking friends, neighbors & strangers about their hearing aids.  Their reviews ranged from the good & the bad, to the very ugly.In Oct 2023 a hearing test by an ENT confirmed what I already knew. I was then informed that prices ranged from $8000 for the best hearing aids to $2000 for the basic set.  Of course, my insurance company would help me if I bought their brand from their distributor. Prices fell to $6000 down to ""around"" $1400.After scratching my head I looked for other Insurance Companies for 2024.  They basically were all the same.  After a few more scratches, I tried Amazon & searched for hearing aids.  They were all the ones you may, by now, have seen.Using an excel spreadsheet, I tracked all brands, types, prices &, most important, the reviews.  I read 5 star reviews down to 1 star, with special note of verified purchases.Then I did something most folks might not do. I called the Blaids company direct.  Customer Specialist, Mae, answered the phone.  Accountants ask lots of questions.  I asked more than most.  She answered every question & then some. She asked what I liked most. I told her everything. She was very patient.  Mae said to call back if I had a question I hadn't asked.A few hours later, an incoming call on my phone displayed the caller's number.  I knew the number. It was the Blaids company. It turned out to be the Blaids C.E.O, Austin (see the video). He answered more questions than the ones I thought of.Longer story shortened, I bought the BlaidsX Pro hearing aids.  They arrived & using the Blaids App, I programmed them myself.  For over two months they were almost perfect.  Almost???  Yes, it seems my self-programming wasn't quite as perfect as I wanted it to be.I called Blaids & Customer Specialist, Emet, answered. I sent him my ENT Test Results & together we updated my adjustments. And just so you know, I've talked, texted & emailed Emet several times since my purchase & he's always been patient, answering all my questions to my satisfaction.This may have sounded like I'm in Advertising.  I'm not.  I'm a retired accountant simply telling you what I found, what I've experienced & what I know."
122,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed,"I purchased this hearing aid, I do not have have bad bad hearing needed it for Church and travel to hear far away. This is junk it never worked when I tried to use it for travel."
122,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,lost never to be found,"was changing and the horrible stiff tube caught on my nightgown and it went flying. hours of crawling around on the floor and even getting a blacklight yeilded nothing despite the spare tube showing the glow of the plastic to look for.I do not understand the insistence of every company to make these horrid things colored in such a way to make them impossible to find, as slippery on skin and catchy as possible on hair and clothing. you should probably buy real ones as these are extremely sub par and designed to never be found."
122,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very satisfied and relieved,BlaidsX Pro really helped my dad hear better! They configured to his exact audiogram from the test in their app. Was just like the one he got at the clinic. Great way to save money without sacrificing quality.

122,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent Hearing Aids,"I only need one hearing aid. It is very comfortable and I can hear so much better. I find I turn the TV volume down instead of up. Excellent customer service, which is rare nowadays. I’m so glad I purchased this, makes my life much easier. It’s a good price also. The audio test was very easy to take, just using phone and hearing aid. Thank you."
122,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Really works well,"My wife lost hearing in one ear completely.  We've tried a bunch of devices, went to specialists, and got nothing that worked well.

122,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not for profound hearing loss.,"These aids do not work for profound hearing loss.  Therefore, I am returning them."
122,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,Bluetooth-kind of,Hearing aids are advertised as Bluetooth. But they are not Bluetooth streaming. Bluetooth for the audio program only.  Which really isn’t worth the extra money. I cannot tell any difference between factory default settings or after audio programming has been completed.

122,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product would recommend,"I bought just the left ear due to my hearing loss in just my left ear. I have to say these are amazing hearing aids. I tried hearing amplifiers and they are not great at all with my hearing loss. The sound quality of these is really great it surprised me how great they were. The only issue I have is not with the hearing aid but with the app. The app disconnects a lot, but when it works fine it’s great. I would recommend and will buy another one from this company when this one goes bad."
122,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,Missing left hearing aid,Only received one right hearing aid is missing left hearing aid .
122,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Quality, affordable hearing aids","I waited till OTC hearing aids became available on the market and shopped among all options I could find for this terrific device. It's programmable by an app on your phone so no need for in office visits. It's a fraction of the cost of previous units I've bought with comparable results. When I lost a unit and reached out for replacement, Brian offered excellent customer service including a virtual session to dial the device in further, and replacement. I strongly recommend this product and this company! Thanks Brian."

122,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,JUNK!,I have replaced the batteries MULTIPLE times and continue to receive low battery alert!  Very annoying.  Bluetooth RARELY connects.  Have to restart phone or hearing aid and “maybe” it will connect.  Would NOT recommend!

122,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Easy to use,"I bought Blaids for my dad and had an excellent experience. Their customer service is the best I've encountered out of all the hearing aid brands we have tried. They patiently helped my dad through each step of the process and we could not be happier with the results. Great technology, great people!"
122,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Somethings wrong with this listing.,"I've been looking at this product for a few days, was going to buy it today but couldn't wrap my head around why I'm hesitant. Finally figured it out!So 5 out 5 reviews from 3 people with 2 thumb ups on each. ( Ok I don't always thumb up either but I do read reviews however these are so generic about a product that's supposed to be revolutionary and allow you to avoid going to a hearing doctor?) There's no description anywhere in the details, or the advertisement on wether this is battery or rechargeable. Nothing listed in why in the box on either. How long does it last? What's the battery life? Infinite? Is setup easy or difficult being that your taking a hearing test with out a doctor's visit? It's an awesome 3yr warranty and $100 discount but you're not givinge more than the basics to hang my hat on. All I found were the reviews and no ask a question option otherwise I'd do that instead of leaving a review for a purchase I would have loved to have made."
122,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent hearing aids !!!,"Absolutely love my Blaids! I tried all the major ""self fitting OTC"" brands and Blaids is far superior to them in terms of sound quality and configurability. Blaids is the only hearing aid that allowed me to upload my audiogram from my doctor in their mobile app. I noticed their app has far more customization and fine tuning options than the other brands I tried. I also tried the Blaids hearing test and found it came out exactly like the one from my doctor so they are doing something right."
122,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent customer service.,"I purchased one hearing aid for a family member. No problems with the hearing aid. The app is great and very easy to use and never had a problem with pairing.My sister purchased a set of the BlaidsX Pro Programmable Hearing Aids several months ago and never had a problem with them, she recommended the BlaidsX to me after owning a ridiculous price set of aids that only lasted three years.  I will purchase a set of BlaidsX Pro Programmable Hearing Aids for myself soon."
122,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Complete failure,"I like the shape and size of the units. These units would not Bluetooth to my Apple phone. I attempted to follow all suggestions from the manual. After a few minutes. There was a tone up and down several time, then units would shut down."
122,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Returning is a nightmare,This unit is marginal at best. Returned over two weeks ago and still no response from Amazon

122,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great customer service but if it doesn't work with your phone return it.,"I couldn't get my phone to pair with my Samsung Note 20 Ultra.  Customer support answers the phone right away and will work with you.  I could have upgraded my phone to see if it would work, but I chose to buy my hearing aids from Costco instead.  Give them a try and if it works right away it will be great for you."
122,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Revised to five stars, superior support!","I bought these five months ago. One unit malfunctioned, and was immediately replaced by Blaids. When a second malfunction happened, again the unit was immediately replaced. While getting them set for my particular hearing problems, I had excellent support from the staff, and with the Blaids team, including the CEO Austin, we got them functioning properly for me. I revised my rating because of the support and enthusiasm of the support staff, who went ""above and beyond"" to help me to hear better than I have for a while."
122,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Did not meet my needs.,This single hearing aid for the right ear did not meet my needs for hearing augmentation so I am returning it.
122,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Better than the prescription hearing aids for a number of reasons.,"First and foremost, I'm deaf in my right ear and have compromised hearing in my left ear. I like that I could buy only the one hearing aid that I needed. I also appreciate the blaids hearing aids work independently so you can wear just one. These are things you can't do with a lot of over-the-counter hearing devices.  I've tried dozens of over-the-counter hearing devices. Most are just amplifiers. The multichannel ones are better but they don't reach a high enough frequency or volume. They also make you wear both hearing aids or at least test both hearing aids which was a waste of time for me.Learning the blaids app was probably the most difficult part about this hearing aid and the one thing I would say they need to work on. I think they do a decent job considering the insane amount of options you have between taking a hearing test and having the hearing aids customized or customizing the hearing aids in multiple different ways.Here's where the blaids get better than the doctor provided hearing aids that I've tried.  My hearing changes on a regular basis. The prescription hearing aids were useless for me because I would have to go to a storefront where a fake doctor would look at the device, ask me a few questions, make a few adjustments and hand it back to me. With my hearing I'd have to do that three to four times a week if I really wanted it to be useful.  With the blaids if I ever feel it's not performing optimally, I do another test.  In minutes, I can see how my hearing has changed and also the hearing aid changes to accommodate it.  I can't say enough about these hearing aids and how life-changing they are. Being able to hear when you go out to bars or at parties is invaluable. Being able to make adjustments on the phone on the fly for things like increasing voice, lowering base volume, noise reduction and so on is really great.  These aren't cheap compared to the other over the counter options but they are compared to prescription / storefront options.  They also are well worth the money.In fact the only drawback I could possibly find with these hearing aids is that they use batteries and aren't rechargeable. That almost stopped me from buying them but I'm glad it didn't. The batteries last about 3 to 4 days and are extremely reasonable.A side note: You don't need your phone with you to use the hearing aids. The phone is only for adjusting and settiing them up."
122,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Changed my life,"I was concerned when I got a hearing test that disclosed moderate hearing loss.  The quoted cost for hearing aids (5k) was a put off.  A friend recommended Blaides, and for the cost, I was willing to take a step into the unknown. Wow.  My daughter in law has severe hearing loss and has been using various hearing aids for years.  She's so impressed with not only the hearing aids themselves but the customer service and support that are behind them. So am I, but I had no basis for comparison.  I am pleased and feel like I am more myself. For those who are hesitant to use hearing aids, you will not regret taking care of your hearing.  You may have no idea how numb you are becoming to the world, or how dull it has become.  And you may not be aware how much you are missing in social settings, or how annoying you are becoming to others who constantly have to repeat things.  And you will certainly not regret buying these.  Not only could I use my audigram test previously done by a professional to set the parameters,  I could have used Blaides' program to check my hearing. An audiologist with the company is available, there are presets for various environments, and I easily customized my experience. As far a look is concerned, people don't even notice them, and neither do I. And don't be put off my the fact you can't recharge.  Batteries are cheap, and you will never be tied to a yet ANOTHER charger (cellphone, smart watch...) And I don't care that the hearing aids don't double as earbuds (which I understand can be a pain depending on your phone, continuous upgrades on your phone, etc)  Anyone who wants to pay thousands for that can.  And I wouldn't be surprised that that becomes a feature down the road.  At this price, upgrading as technology advances remains in reach.  If you pay 5k for another brand you can rapidly fall behind because upgrading will be prohibitive. So, attractive, effective, and well supported. What are you waiting for?"
122,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Better than my $3000 aids from a few years ago,"The quality of these is quite comparable to the most expensive units. The programmability was the main reason I wanted to try these; I've used many many EQ units over 40 years of music and recording, I *know* what things are supposed to sound like and how to adjust setting to get them there. These fill the bill.The very best thing, though, is astounding customer service. Being able to reach someone at the company, who either knows or can find the answer when you have a question is very nice. The people who work there, at least as of May/June 2023, seem extraordinarily dedicated to 'wow'-ing with speedy, kind, and competent customer service."
122,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not great.,"This is the first hearing aid I have tried some I don’t know if it is better than others.I received mine missing the earcups, cleaning kit, batteries and anything else that was supposed to be in the case. I called the number included and received them in the mail a few days later. The person that answered the phone was helpful and pleasant.The sound is tinny and adjustments are not specific enough to limit the high pitched sounds like a chip bag rattling. If the volume is high enough to improve hearing the high pitch sounds are overwhelming.The device also makes a very loud, Painful, high pitched beep when switching between modes via Bluetooth if the device is still in the ear."
122,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best hearing aid I ever had!,"I am 90 years old. Instead of buying another expensive Widex, after extensive research on Amazon, purchased the Blaidsx Pro which was duly delivered to my home. First important pro: No expensive visits to audiologist, no taxi fares etc. Downloaded the free app, did audiotest with this app, put hearing aid in my ear (needed only one because other ear is deaf) and had the best audio experience in many years! I could even fine tune the bass. Apart from best hearing, another pro: first hearing aid so slim and lightweight that it did not interfere with my glasses (always a problem). In fact, it is so unobtrusive that on several occasions I forgot to take it out when going to sleep! Not only is it invisible, but also unfeelable. I'm not a regular review writer, but I have to share my enthousiasm."
122,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,,Me encantaron. Fueron faciles de programar con el bluetooh. Escucho super bien
122,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Price for premium hearing aids,Thus is the second set of hearing aids that I have tried.  The first being at the audiologist when I found that I needed hearing help.  These hearings aids are the real deal and just as good as the ones that cost anywhere from 4 to 8 thousand dollars.  Great devices and at even better price.
122,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing customer service,Just got the hearing aids today and setup was a breeze. Tried amplifiers before but not happy with them. Theses sound great. I had a quick question so I called the customer service number late on Saturday  and a person actually answered  the phone. I talked to a guy named Brian that was super nice and helpful.Glad to see customer service is not dead in these days of automated AI and robot FAQ
122,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best customer service!,We got these for my dad. Excellent quality!! My dad liked them but wanted to upgrade to the rechargeable ones and Emmit helped walk him through everything and get him set up. He couldn't be happier!
122,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Customer Service,"I don’t generally review products, but I had to with this case. I purchased a hearing aid from this company two months ago and I really enjoyed using it. You cannot beat this product. It performs a hearing test and sets the level according to the sounds, you cannot hear, however after two months, the product no longer functioned, so I called customer service. The service department picked up immediately and within two minutes they had resolved my issue and replaced it without any fuss. I wish all companies had customer service like that!"
122,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,the bluetooth connection and not showing the device after installing the app,"I'm having difficulty connecting it with my phone ""Samsung s24""I installed the application and so far everything worked fineAfter installation and frequency correction,I entered the Bluetooth connection on my s24 and it doesn't find the BlaidsX ProI ask for help to solve this problem because once it already workedThank you very much for your help and I hope to resolve this issue"
122,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,It helped my hearing,I am not sure what I need to hear better.  This was the best I have tried.  I believe I need more background filter.  I also didn’t like the plastic piece that helps to hold it in my ear.
122,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,Can’t get customer service anymore,Helped when I first bought them but I have a problem now and no response after severalAttempts on different days
122,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great hearing aids for the price!!,"These hearing aids far exceed my expectations!  I was quoted by a nationally known hearing aid company a total in excess of $9,000 for what they referred to was state of the art. I found that Blair’s is likewise State of the Art only for a fraction of the price. They have great customer support and the phone app that lets you configure the devices in real time to the environment you are in. Before spending thousands of dollars at those National firms give Blair’s a try (30 day trial), use their technical support to help you tweak the devices. I can assure you that you will find them amazing and easy to use. Remember they have GREAT customer support!"
122,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Is really helps,This hearing aid works a lot better than the other hearing aid I had Yes this one is a little bit more expensive but I like the app to where you can set everything and do the hearing test and it works out real good get about two and a half days on battery life so I think that's pretty good All in all I like it.
122,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These work well, and Customer Service is Amazing","I had a technical issue with the app on my particular phone.  I called Customer Service, and their rep was very knowledgeable and resolved the issue quickly.The hearing aids themselves are excellent for behind-the-ear devices.  I was able to use the hearing test option in the app to determine my hearing loss at specific frequencies, and then upload the cutomized results to the hearing aids over bluetooth.  One of the sound tubes was a little short for my ear.  The larger size sound tube was included in the package -- it was fairly easy to change out.The app itself has an option to set any one of four operation modes, such as outdoor, indoor, etc.  I thought the beep confirmation when changing modes was too loud, and I brought this up with the Tech Support rep.  He confirmed the issue and put in a software update request.  This issue is not a deal killer but it's a little annoying -- they will put the fix  in a future release.  I must say it is very rare to find a company that provides individual, knowledgeable support and actually listens to their customers. (It's a hearing aid company, after all ;-)  So I'm happy."
122,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Gave me more freedom walking & driving,"I am a retired 89-year-old USAF veteran. I have lost my hearing from Jet engines. VA made some signia aids for me. They were horrible even after several trips to tweak them. After a few months of trying them, I gave up and bought some Phonax. They were better but very difficult to wear throughout the day. I saw the Blaid Pro advertised and decided to try it, especially after offering a coupon and a 2-year warranty. I couldn't believe the sounds I had been unable to hear. I give the aids a 5-star rating."
122,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,The best!!!,I love these hearing aids. Great fit unbelievable sound quality. The app is so easy to use and adjust everything on them. You can tune them to your hearing any time you want sitting in your house. No office visits or copays. The battery life is very good. Their great!!!
122,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Very poor quality- update,Update- the company has worked with me to get me a replacement hearing aide- no questions asked. It works but haven’t had a chance to wear it consistently so can’t say if it’s working 100%. Due to this I have changed my rating. Thank you for working with me.Got the first hearing aide worked for a day then completely would not work. Sounded like it was dying. Changed the battery a handful of times. Nothing worked. Customer service was good. Sent me a replacement. Even the replacement did not work. Worked for half a day and then slowly died. Put new batteries in and it wouldn’t work. Awful. I will spend more money for a better quality and a piece that actually works.
122,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent product,"The is a high quality real hearing aid  . The hearing test and customization is super easy and the customer service is really friendly Knowledgeable  and helpful  . Ive had the best and the cheap  ..( which always have feedback issues)This does not do feedback . They will work with you till you get it right just for you.The  best part for me is  to  control it from my phone ,I dont like messing with tiny little things buttons  on the device .  I have really shopped this market  Im happy with this Blaids  hearing aid and give it Thumbs up !"
122,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,I have to keep changing the batteries on Blains Pro hearing aids - ridiculous!,Disliked the thought of having to change the batteries about every month.  I wanted rechargeable hearing aids - not those with replacement batteries!  That is what I asked for with Amazon but didn't get!  Also I wanted ITC type of hearing aids but had to settle on behind the ear since that was the only one available at a price that I could afford!
122,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great value for this product,"Ugh, well I'm 52 years old and have had hearing problems my whole life. I finally spared those around me, went to an ear, nose, & throat doctor, got a hearing test and was told I lost most all hearing in my left ear.  I scheduled a consultation with a nationally known hearing aid center only to find that my premium medical insurance would not cover the cost, not one penny of the cost of a hearing aid.  I was quoted $5K for two hearing aids!  I felt like I only need one, but still that's $2500 out of pocket.  I read numerous hearing aid descriptions online and on Amazon and ordered the Blaids Pro and have to say I'm highly impressed.  Fits well, my hearing is highly improved, and cost a fraction of the one I was quoted.  Great value and more importantly, it works great!"
122,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Outstanding product and customer service,I love the hearing aids these or better then the 5000 dollars ones I had you will not go wrong here try them you wont believe it finally a company that has pride in there products that's rare now days customer service  outstanding thanks so much Emmett you deserve a raise! These hearing aids will surprise you yes they or that good!
122,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Hearing in stereo,"This is my first programmable hearing aid.  Had been using a treble/bass one for 7 years.  Entered my audiogram data and got a ton of back feed.  Tried using the advanced feature and helped some.  Switched to the solid cap design and it helped.  I have some sever loss in the upper range, 85-90, so modified to max of 80.  After doing more advance setting, finally got the feed back under control.  Running volume control at 6 and for the first time in years, am now hearing in stereo.  I still get some occasional chirping but can live with it.  Removing the tube for cleaning could be a challenge for weak hands.  Old ear buds had a tool to help.  These are just pure brute force.Update:  After one month, the tube no longer fits tight.  When I called support, was told the tube is an accessory and not covered by the warranty.  They offered to give me one replacement since I had only had it one month.  These could become an expensive proposition."
122,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great phone support, long battery life","This was my very first hearing aid.  My hearing test showed a pronounced difference between my left and right ear so much so that they wouldn't talk about hearing aids until I had an MRI to be sure I didn't have an acoustic neuroma which is a kind of benign tumor.  The MRI said I was good so I ordered this hearing aid.  I had no idea what to expect since it was my first one.  It was very easy to set up and very easy to manually input the audiogram from the paper graph I had.  I called two or three times to get help with issues like a metallic sound I was experiencing.  The person that helps you answers the phone.  There is no recorded voice with endless menu options which is rare now.  He knew what to do and the adjustments helped.I might not have returned it except that I lost it twice.  Luckily, I found it both times but something as simple as putting on my sunglasses would knock it off my ear.  I also think the hearing loss in my left ear is too pronounced for this to work without a fitting by an audiologist.The audiologist fitted me with a more expensive hearing aid but it is rechargeable and does not come off easily, mainly I think because the ear tube is stiffer and she custom fitted it to my ear.  She also performed a serious of audio tests that let her change frequencies and volume of the aid on her computer.  I will have two more visits for them to fine tune the device.Bottom line if it is your hearing loss is not very severe and especially if your insurance doesn't cover the more expensive devices or you don't have the money to pay yourself, this hearing aid is probably a good choice.  Just be sure to understand exactly how to fit it to your ear so you don't lose it.  Batteries seemed to last about 4 days which seems pretty good."
122,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,BETTER THAN MY  $1800.00 NAME BRAND,"Great sound. Great clarity. 4 stars because it will not pair with bluetooth if battery is low and also acts up with beeps and buzzes to let you know the battery is low.  To get the best performance it should be paired with your phone using the app.  As soon as it connects you can hear the sharpness and high fidelity sound.  It will work without pairing but not as good and you do not have access to different modes (WHICH ARE GREAT) and the app's volume control.  It does have volume control on the device but more difficult to use.  I used the hearing test on the app and probably need to do it again now that I have gotten familiar with the hearing Aid...  I use my old expensive one in my right ear and this one in my left.  WHY?  THE DOG ATE MY OTHER ONE.  THANK GOD HE DID NOT EAT THE BATTERY!!!  THE BATTERY WILL KILL YOUR DOG IN AN AGONIZING DEATH.  SO KEEP AWAY FROM YOUR DOG...I CAN HEAR BETTER WITH THIS THAN MY NAME BRAND EXPENSIVE HEARING AIDE.  GIVEN MY OLD HEARING PROBABLY NEEDS REPROGRAMMING AND HEARING LOSS IS WORSE IN MY RIGHT EAR.  BUT I DO NOT HAVE TO GO TO THE HEARING AIDE SALESMAN TO REPROGRAM THIS HEARING AIDE AND SIT THROUGH A SALES PITCH FOR AN EXPENSIVE INFERIOR PRODUCT.VERY IMPORTANT... REPLACE THE HEARING TUBES YEARLY.. I HAD ONE BREAK OFF IN MY EAR!!!  THE DOCTOR COULD NOT GET IT OUT.. SO I BOUGHT A FIBER OPTIC SCOPE FROM AMAZON $20.00... SMALL HEMISTATS WE USED TO CLAMP PUPPY ""CORDS""- BOUGHT FROM AMAZON AND GOT IT OUT MYSELF.  I WOULD NOT RECOMMENDED THIS BECAUSE YOU COULD EASILY DAMAGE YOUR EAR DRUM.  LET THE DOCTOR DO IT!!"
122,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,"cant get them to hook up to my iphone bluetooth,","upset because they will not hook up to my iphone blue tooth , BUT They do work awesome otherwise sounds great etc . im tired of paying 6-7 grand for hearing aides"
122,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Remarkable- Easy Setup- What a Difference,"This is an update to my initial review which you’ll see below. I had a problem with the low battery alarm. I called the number provided which my Baldex and was I surprised - visited with me about what I was experiencing and sent out a new aid that day asking only that I return the defective unit when it arrived. Within 4 days I received the new aid!  It works as it should with the remarkable clarity that I initially reported. The only thing to add is it’s so natural that I often forget I have in.Arrived promptly, well packaged with everything as advertised. Note that I have total loss in one ear and about 50% loss in other which is the one I ordered the aid to assist.Quick start instructions easy to follow. App and hearing test worked with Bluetooth to set unit profile and nailed it - unbelievable - granted my old aid had seen better days but found the difference, clarity, natural sound restoration, ease of adjustment in noisy environments and comfort to far exceed many I had tried - to say nothing of my expectations.Now we’ll just see how they stand over time but am comfortable with the warranty and reputation available service!."
122,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great customer service,This is my very first review of anything but feel that the customer support team of this company deserves a shout out.  This is my first hearing aid so I needed a good bit of support.  When you call you get to speak with a live person which does not happen much these days.  The tech is knowledgable and patient and that is not always the case when it comes to people that can't hear well.  The product itself is working well for me and I have had to deal with adjustments due to hearing decline.  The customer support has been outstanding!
122,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Decent for the price,The only complaint I have is the high-pitch noise it makes if the silicone ear piece isn’t fully secure to your ear canal. Otherwise it’s a good hearing aid for the price.
122,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent customer service, and great value.","I purchased these a few weeks ago, and here are my observations:The units are small and easy to use. The batteries will last several days. There is an app to download that allows you to do an initial test so the hearing aids can be adjusted to properly compensate for your hearing loss. One of the biggest surprises I found was that the customer support is not just good, but outstanding.I initially called before the purchase to ask if these could be worn along with my Bose NC700 headphones that I use for phone calls and Teams sessions. Brian assured be that they worked for that for most people.I ordered the units and had their support people work with me to dial in the settings. They had no problem working with me and making sure that I was satisfied.  So... this may come as a twist, but I am leaving a 5 star review for product that I ultimately had to return. Why, well no problem getting my refund in about a week. To explain further, I have a  unique situation at work that turned out to require a different type of device. I ended up ordering a different type of hearing aid due to my unique situation. Still, I would not hesitate to suggest these before spending big money on some of the other brands.The Blaids people stand behind their products, and offer great service. If you are looking to try an over the counter hearing aid, I think you will be pleased with the product and after service."
122,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,So Far So Good.,"Units are as advertised.  Only been wearing them a week so I'm still getting acquainted with them. I am going to call tech support for advice in using the App., but so far I am satisfied with them for the price. I do like them over my expensive pair of Bell tone Legends. Time will tell but I do like the 2year warranty they give with them."
122,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great hearing aids for the price.,"As a new hearing aid user I tried the expensive name brand and really liked them, but couldn’t afford several thousand dollars at this time. After searching several different brands of OTC aids I chose the Blaids brand for several reasons. Primarily I wanted to be able to set up and adjust the different frequency responses myself. I’m not a fan of “one size fits all” when it comes to something this personal. Secondly, I liked the reviews on these. The customer service reports are impressive. I called with a problem and was treated well. The agent tried to work through a problem but the first unit was defective. So, I sent it in and got a replacement with no problems. I’m very happy with my new unit(s). And look forward to hearing better from now on. Sound quality is very good. I don’t have a couple of the features that the expensive aids had, but for the price difference I’m okay with that. (No streaming music or phone calls.) I don’t know about other competitors in this price range, but if or when these wear out I’ll probably get the same ones again. The four stars on battery life and comfort are likely not a fault with this brand any more than with any others. I prefer replaceable batteries because eventually rechargeable batteries quit working."

113,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Directional microphone helps. Off the market soon?,"I have used a Tweak Focus for a year and a half.  I have only moderate to light hearing loss, but I have trouble with voices in noisy environments, so I bought two.  One gave up after a year.  The other is still going well.  I replaced the defective one with the Tweak Focus +.  It was just as good, but it failed after only a short time.  Same with its replacement.  I was disappointed.  I bought another product and found that its volume overwhelmed my ear.I like the two microphones.  It can really help to block out noise behind me sometimes--not always.  Volume controls are effective.I suppose that any hearing device takes some getting used to.  That is the case for me, for sure.  I will purchase another Tweak Focus for my better ear.  Time will tell.I am glad that I have bought insurance for electronic devices.I looked for the Tweak Focus, but could only find the Tweak Focus +.  I do not need the plus, but it is not a hassle.  I am wondering if this device is soon to be discontinued totally.  A shame.I said that the Tweak Focus is not of good quality because they have not all held up for me.  Reviews that I read before purchase said the same."
113,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent for this 93 yr-old,"I have a long history with hearing aids which led me to Tweak. I've been happy with Tweak for 5 years now. Twelve years ago an audiologist sold me my first hearing aids for $3500. In 4 years one of them stopped working and couldn't be fixed. So I went on Amazon and bought a Tweak for $325. Now I had $325 in one ear and $1750 in the other. The performance of both was equally good. Out of curiosity I bought another brand device for about $350 to replace the $1750 one. It worked well, too. What sold me on the Tweak was it's ability to quiet noise in the back and side of you and focus on the sound in front of you. Great for noisy restaurants. The Tweak has 2 microphones, one focused in front and one all around. You just turn off the all around ones and focus on the person you're speaking with in front of you. They allowed me 30-day trials. How could I lose?The size and shape of the cone in your ear makes a difference in how well you hear. Try the different ones that come in your sample pack.  I believe the difference in price between Tweak ""Personal Sound Amplifier"" (PSA) and an audiologist's FDA approved ""Hearing Aid"" is not the technology but the cost of the audiologist and the approval process. If you have special hearing problems or need personal support, go with an audiologist.  Otherwise test the PSA's yourself."
113,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,3 Times Bad,"I purchased this amplifier after reading good reviews.  I have mild hearing loss in one ear due to a virus, and had tried the expensive full service hearing aids, so I know how to care for them, and how they work.  After trial and error over a few years, I discovered a more simple amplifer would work for my particular issue.  Tweak fullfills their orders through Amazon directly.  The first one I ordered was dirty and had obviously been used.  Returned.  Second one worked for about 3 weeks, and died.  Returned again.  Third one lasted about 2 months, and started having a high pitched electronic sound.  Was not feedback, and nothing would make it stop.  Returned.  Never purchasing another Tweak product.  They do not last, which must be why they only offer a 6 month warranty.  They appeared to work fine when they did work.  Just don't expect that to be for a significant time period."
113,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Nice but not great,"Its not too bulky but not the smallest I have had.  The sound is clear, crisp and under-standable for the most part but it does not amplify soft noises and does not rival with the hearing aid that I paid thousands of dollars.  For this price range it is not bad."
113,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,Didn't work,Came quickly but would not funtion.
113,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good noise cancellation,"I purchased two of these separately. When the first one arrived it was not a Focus +T but a Tweak LITE. I returned that one and purchased an actual Tweak Focus + T. I have tried other brands and, so far, this one works best for me. The noise cancellation works well and I can hear my students fairly well. Few people notice I have it on unless I tell them. I will likely get another. The downside is that it has no on/off switch so you have to open the battery door to turn it off."
113,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Give these a try! They're great.,"About 7-8 years ago I knew I needed hearing aids in order to continue working in a hospital. Went to an Audiologist, found out I had significant loss in the higher tone ranges. I was fitted with $6000 behind the ear hearing aids that were bigger, bulkier, and not as comfortable as these Tweak amplifiers. Plus they had a fitted set of vented ""domes"" that completely filled my ear canal. They were horribly uncomfortable and drove me crazy. Every little noise at work was amplified as if two railroad boxcars had smashed together right in front of me. I could hardly wait to get in my car after finishing my shift and yank them out of my ears , Sometimes I had to just sit in silence for several minutes to ""decompress"". I hated them. Since they were essential to my work I also bought a pair if OTC ""hearing aids"" online for about $300 as spares and was chagrined to find out they worked almost as well as my expensive ones, although they were also bulky and had uncomfortable domes. After retiring five years ago I just stopped wearing my hearing aids, but my poor wife suffered as she had to repeat everything she said to me at least once, and we found it necessary to both almost shout to each other, her because she had to for me to hear, and me because it just came with not hearing myself talk well enough to realize I was speaking so loudly. Life became increasingly less fun as I could not hear conversations with friends or understand my grandsons, but I just dreaded wearing those hearing aids. I started looking at OTC hearing aids again several months ago in the hope that I could find something that worked for me at a reasonable price. I narrowed it down to three widely highly reviewed units, including these Tweak amplifiers, which got the nod because our Church now has telecoil and the Tweaks I bought are +T equipped. Let me start talking about the Tweaks by saying that I would not now buy any unit that does not have telecoil capability. These Tweaks are just fabulous but the cherry on the icing on the cake was the first Sunday I attended Mass and heard the sermon as if it was broadcast personally to my ears from the microphone. When the Tweaks came several days after I ordered them (thanks for the fast delivery!) I was amazed at how small, light, and comfortable they were. I was skeptical that such a little unit could work well, and also was certain that I'd have to instill the domes and suffer having them in my ear canal for the units to work well. But I was wrong on all counts. The minute I slipped them in my ears (they almost install themselves it's so easy) and heard my wife's clear, beautiful voice again for the first time in maybe ten years I was thrilled that I bought them. I have now worn them for about two weeks and I intend to keep them and continue to enjoy the best sound amplification that I've had from any of the three units that I have owned. The sound is clear, crisp, and just perfect. I find that they have plenty of volume, and the ""noisy environment"" setting is perfect for helping to hear what needs to be heard and dampening out was doesn't. And again, the telecoil benefit is the bomb. Batteries seem to last six or seven days, and I couldn't be happier with these Tweak +T units, and think they are a real great value.If you think you might benefit from something like the Tweak sound amplifier I strongly recommend that you give them a risk-free trial. I'm sure glad that I did."
113,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Stopped working after a few uses,I bought this for my 94 year old mom. It worked fine about 5 separate uses. Then stopped working. Replaced the battery and it was no help. Very disappointed. Don’t see anyway to complain to company.

147,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great service. Works well,I bought these a couple of days ago and I am hearing better than I have in years  I had been using an amplifier but decided to try these. I'm glad I did.Although I did have to tell my wife to quite shouting at me 😀Wore them for about 12 hours yesterday and they were completely comportable.First time in a long time I could clearly hear our pastor's homily.Which appeared to have been directed at me. 😇Had about 70% powered left when I put them awayI recently reached out by email  (yesterday on a Sunday) asking about types of replacement domes to use and already this morning have a useful and quite pleasant reply!I worry a bit about the wires between the unit and the receiver but time will tell.Based on customer service so far I doubt that will be a problem.All in all I am very happy with the purchase and believe they are a good value for the price.
147,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,These aids provide most natural sound and voice clarity.,"""I have tried numerous otc aids from Amazon. I kept the Phonak in ite model and for OTE these have proved exceptional. I was able to enter my own audiogram results on the HA Fit app. The bluetooth connect works with one of our old G10e phones with pressing once on aid volume to pair and they then connect to app. They appear to match the Phonak with ambient noise control especially in church....no others have. The ite receiver is progressive design. I wish I had a couple more increased volume levels but overall it's 90% and the most comfortable of all to wear in a hot climate. I am very happy to have chosen them."""
147,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,After trying 4 different hearing aids I think I finally am comfortable with these,This is the fourth pair I am trying. So far I think these will serve their purpose. Hearing aids take some getting used to. For me I don’t like hearing my voice as I talk. But these are better than the others. Time will tell
147,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth the money,I had went to a couple other hearing aid centers and they wanted outrageous amounts of money I found this Viv tone on Amazon and it has been a great purchase.

13,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,My wireless mouse caused interference,They were decent earbuds. Music was clear and full. The hearing aid part did not work for me. It amplified all sounds. Sometimes it helped. Often it didn't. I could not get the buds to stay in my ear. I tried all the tips supplied. Sadly I returned them. I wanted them to work.
13,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,My son’s dr recommended these,These are great if you suffer hearing loss or have difficulty tuning out distracting noise.
13,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very helpful for slight hearing loss especially when watching TV,Customer service is exceptional.  Product is exactly what I was hoping for - significantly helps my husband hear better especially when watching TV.  We can now keep the volume at a reasonable level.

13,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Good streaming sound, but...","The sound from streaming devices is great.  However, the ""world"" sound is screechy.  And the fitting is a nuisance, needing to be screwed back into the ears every few minutes.  Yes, I tried various sizes of tips.  If you sit without moving your jaw they may stay in .  Walking they will fall out."
13,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Almost Perfect While They Last,"I've tried several hearing aids, which varied from fair to awful and the Nuhearas are the ones I keep coming back to. So why only 4 stars? The big one is battery life. I fly to Hawaii 2-3 times a year, and these don't last the whole trip. Sound quality for music and movies is more than acceptable, as is noise cancelling. Maybe not best in class, but stillvery good. Processing latency isn't a parameter mentioned often, but when you hear the original before the amplified version, that's a problem -that luckily Nuhearas don't have. The Focus feature I find very effective in restaurants by using multiple mic tricks making the devices more directional. I read a lot of other complaints and most of them are from people unclear on the concepts. Like why the hearing aid function doesn't work with noise cancelling on. Seriously?So, do I recommend these? Absolutely. Just one serious caveat - be prepared to wish the batteries lasted longer. Double the battery life and I'd give them 5 Stars without hesitation."
13,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth the spend. Buy something else cheaper.,Not worth the spend. As to adding hearing….that’s a joke.

13,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Great concept, wanted to like them, but ...","Having moderate hearing loss I wanted something other than standard hearing aids. I stumbled on Nuheara out of Australia and thought I'd give the IQbuds 2 MAX a shot. Unfortunately the price doesn't match the quality. The fit isn't great as it's a one size fits all, they hurt my ears after an hour-ish. Sound is okay as is the Active Noise cancelling. They do squeal if fitment in the ear canal isn't tight, suppose that is expected. The worst part is the battery life, given today's available technology 3 hours is not enough. Mine have never fully charged to 100% and drops % quickly while using. These are quite large as well. The case is nice and small. I'm advising you to spend your money on something else. These are not the best thing since sliced bread for the price point. I have buyers remorse."
13,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,Great headphones poor hearing aid,I purchased these to aid with hearing voices. I thought they might be useful because of the noise cancellation feature and custom adjustments. I found the ability to aid hearing is negligible and I can hear voices better without the earbuds. I have been in contact (email) with the support on many occasions trying to make the buds function. I support does is refer me to help pages on their site. No personalized support. I cannot use them for hearing improvement. I paid $399 for noise cancelling ear buds. What a rip off.
13,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Removes background noises in loud places.  Now conversation are a breeze!,"I bought these from Nuheara as they were having a sale, but now the same price is right here on Amazon.  My hearing tests annually show I have no trouble in a sound-free ""cage"" identifying all tested frequency ranges at very low amplitudes.  In other words I can hear all sounds... even really soft one.However, in a crowded environment like a restaurant or a basketball game, or while watching TV, it's very difficult for me to make out what someone next to me said, and I have to ask them to repeat... which nobody likes to do (either ask people to repeat... or to be asked to repeat).These Nuheara IQ Buds 2 Max worked right out of the box.  They do say to charge them when you get them, but that wasn't needed in my case.  I don't wear them all the time... only when I anticipate being in a loud environment.  The case (which also charges them when inserted and does not need to be plugged into wall power) fits in my pocket just fine.  It's about as high as a Leaterman on its side... which is my jeans pocket EDC knife.  Now it has a friend in the pocket... 2 IQ Buds 2 Max.I can set the direction from which it will listen outside the earbud and play inside the earbud.  I can control amplification (volume).  The app (Android in my case) is rock-solid.  If I use it for 4 hours of meetings a day and ""happy hour"" it lasts the whole day.  Put them back in the case, and they're good in under 15 minutes for another day.  I've yet to have to recharge the cradle/case in over a week's operation.It has several built-in modes: Home, Driving, Restaurant, and World Off.  Note: there may be more.  I dd not read the manual :)  These change how it discriminates against the outside sounds I don't want to hear.  ""Driving"" removes a lot of the engine, most of the road/tire noise, but allows ambulance/fire sirens to come through.  ""Restaurant"" mode removes conversations from other tables and the general ""din"" from reflected sound. ""Home"" is mostly in the middle there... I hear what people say, but it doesn't remove TV, music, or the dog saying ""Time for my dinner!""I'll skip the ""you can make phone calls or talk to Google/Apple/Amazon"" because that's now common for earbuds.Fit&finish is perfect.  The company is based in Australia, and this is not cheap-stuff  Positive magnetic-style click on cradle/case closing.  Positive magnetic grab and store putting the earbuds in the case on the correct side.  Left earbud in right slot doesn't work.  The LED's glow red (charging) and green (charged) which to most people I know intuitively makes sense.If your hearing tests are fine but you have trouble making out the words of the person across the restaurant table from you, or sitting next to you at a sports event (in an enclosed arena) these were made for you.Price-wise at $450 they're not ""cheap.""  Quality never is.  If you can afford it, and if you have friends or family that either ask you to repeat what you said, or appear not to be actually hearing you* (they don't contribute to the conversation) this might be a good Christmas gift for them.EhudTucson, AZ* You can do a verbal Turing Test (like a captcha but not having to click on taxis, buses, stairs, or hills) if you think someone can't hear you but is uncomfortable saying so... by asking a simple question and see if they respond.  Fo example, in normal conversation voice and without staring at that person just throw in ""dad, what is 2+2?"" .... no response means there's a hearing problem.  Note: this is my opinion.  I'm not dispensing medical advice."
13,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Can not get batteries replaced for IQBoost,"nuheara.com shows the IQBoost item on their web page but don’t mention that it is no longer supported.It is notorious for a charger that often fails to push the buds down onto the charge electrodes, so they never charge properly. This eventually causes the buds batteries to fail, while the charger still indicates that the buds are okay.Nuheara technical support on 2012.12.12 told me to FOAD, that they do not replace the batteries, and I’m welcome to spend another $US400 to buy the next upgraded model. The batteries are standard and cost $13 each.  You will face the same poor response when the batteries fail as soon as the warranty expires.Although intended for the hard of hearing, who are usually elderly, the app menus are small text, grey text on a grey background with disappearing menus.  This was not helpful for my 89 year old mother, and I had to make and print her a user manual.  Because their's sucks, and the support videos are insipid.When these do work, they are fantastic.  But they need better support."
13,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Ok, but careful","The media could not be loaded.
                



Ok only.  One of the magnets that hold the buds in popped out. They pop out relatively easy despite trying different size ear pieces.  The ear pieces pop off easy. If eating, they change settings if there is crunchy food.  A bit annoying."
13,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Quite good sounding on streaming material, moderate help with hearing issues","I am over 70 and have mild to moderate overall hearing loss, significant loss in the treble region and a fair amount of difficulty understanding conversations when there is a lot of ""ambience"" in the space I am visiting.  I am also an audiophile and without any hearing assist can still really enjoy very high quality audio...it just needs to be a little louder than some people around me might like.The IQbuds2 MAX are somewhat large but they are comfortable once the right insert was picked for my ear, and I have worn them for several hours at a time with little notice on my part they were there. They do remind me to keep my ear hair trimmed though...Once I ran the apps hearing analyzer, I found the volume from room sources and the quality of streaming music quite good. Setup is easy and the hearing test even helps with selection of the right size among the supplied silicone rubber ear inserts.  I found the medium was the right size but I needed the taller set to seal up my ear canal properly to block outside sound from leaking into my ear, this also provided me with a more tonally balanced sound.  I do prefer to set the apps World EQ control to filter treble on the sound picked up by the mics as the treble seems too loud otherwise.In use as a hearing assist device, it does help me hear and understand other people, particularly those who tend to speak softly, or when I am in a place with lots of echo or background noise. The various environment settings that are tuned to the most likely interfering sounds works pretty well.I find the noise cancelling function pretty effective. I am guessing it reduced incoming sound at least 6db below what the earbuds do just by being in my ears. The combination is probably 20+ db reduction and that is based largely on my experience with various Peltor ear protectors.Streaming sound quality is surprisingly good, especially considering the earbuds are limited to AptX and Aptx-LL, both lossy formats. It would be nice if they also supported AptX-HD as I have found this a significant sound quality upgrade over AptX with other BT 5.0 devices I own.  The AptX-LL is very low in terms of latency.  By the way, my headphone reference point is the Stax SRX MK3. In my opinion everything on earth is a step down from them when driven by a proper amp, but the IQbuds2 MAX hold their own.A couple things I would like to see:More extensive World EQ tuning ability, such as an optional multi-band digital graphic EQ.Support for AptX-HD.Full functionality streaming support for a better bluetooth ""TV"" transmitter.The IQstream TV Nuheara sells works OK but requires sound sources be 2 channel PCM.  That means if I am using the earbuds in my home theater I have to change the system sound from dolby digital or dts multichannel over to 2 channel PCM or the bluetooth transmitter wont send anything to the earbuds. That significantly reduces the enjoyment factor of anyone else in the room.  I know I can use an analog output of the home theater sound processor to feed the IQstreamer and get around this, but having tried it I can say that the need to convert the sound to analog and back to digital in order to stream it significantly reduces the quality compared to the available SPDIF input. I presently address this issue by using an Avantree Orbit which is a bluetooth transmitter similar to the IQ streamer, but it does accept dolby digital and dts 5.1, then translates it to PCM before bluetoothing to the earbuds. This allows the home theater to operate in the surround mode of the A/V source and me to use the earbuds at the same time.  What I loose doing this is the ability to control the volume/mute coming to the earbuds because the Nuheara app only supports the IQstreamer TV.  The Orbit does have volume controls but they now need to be controlled on the transmitter itself (or through an IR remote/receiver that I have made - but not yet installed - into the Orbit).Overall I am quite pleased with the IQbuds2 MAX.  From my perspective they are preferable to buying very expensive custom hearing aids."
13,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Okay while they lasted.,"My main problem was with the charging case. After slightly more than a year, the charging port came loose from the circuit board. I opened the case and could see that the port had not been securely fastened to the circuit board. The way this is made, it is likely a common problem. Now I have these earbuds with no way to charge them. Otherwise the earbuds are quite good but very sensitive to feedback when used in world mode. They need to be sealed into the ear very tightly to avoid any sound leakage in world mode."
13,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Absolute garbage,"Battery life is completely terrible, connectivity is awful, sound boosting is exactly the same as the first model. The only difference is the ""hearing test"" on the poorly designed app. hardly worth the massively boosted price tag. Case is awkwardly shaped and sized and hard to close, meaning that the buds often don't charge properly, casing on the buds started falling apart after a couple of months. Horrible quality and too large to fit ears comfortably for long time periods."
13,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not powerful enough for anybody except for the most minimal hearing loss.,"The heading says it all. These hearing aids do not have enough volume for anyone except those with a very slight hearing loss. I have moderate to severe loss and I can hardly tell I'm wearing them at all.

13,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing for me.,"These worked for me: I have tinnitus and an audio processing disorder. I set it up; did the hearing test, and played with the sound feature/location settings. ANC/world off, SYNC, and Focus work perfectly and I can hear the difference. You can toggle focus, world off, etc from the earbuds touch controls. These helped me head speech clearer, and my tinnitus isn't really perceivable with them on..I think the bit of white noise from the filtered audio helped mask it. It's such a relief..The only con I can think of is that I wish there were extra slots for touch controls (i.e. you can pick focus toggle or change location type, but you can't have both..they have a dedicated slot that allows them.)I'm not sure if this is the newest version of the ear cups though; videos mentioned a little hole having been added to prevent the ear plug effect when you speak. At least, as I understood it.Fit: they actually lock decently into the shape of the ear; I can shake my head around without them loosening. They also have squishy shaped ear cups in addition to the rubber ones-----------------------TLDR: they work for people who test mostly normal on audiology tests but have trouble filtering speech, and help reduce excessively loud high or low end sound based on your preferences. They mask my tinnitus..but your mileage may vary (they're not designed to to that). These probably will not work for someone specifically looking for sound amplification; there's a volume level, but it doesn't go very loud."
13,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Bought it for my wife who is partially deaf.  She loves it!,"Bought them for my wife who is partially deaf.  She loves them!  If you or someone you love has partial deafness you really should try these.  Her VERY expensive hearing aids only give her sounds from high mid-range to very high, despite all the settings she can do with her iphone.  These are controlled with your smart phone, so ya need that.  I also got her a blue tooth adapter to hook up to our big TV, which enables her to really enjoy the sound of the movies and other content more like normal.  The documentation is very clear that these are not hearing aids, but I think that really depends on your level of deafness.  Also, I'm not clear if you hear front to back as much as side to side...if that makes sense...quad if you're as old as me.  Oh yah, sense around.  Any way, you will get much broader frequency range with these for regular things.  The battery life is not great, but not bad; a few hours, depending on your volume.  The made her smile, and that makes it worth it."
13,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Pretty good.....but......,"I'm on the same page as others here .... This product did not fill my needs as hearing enhancements.  They are very good in form and function for most.  The software is very stylized and executed.  But I could not wear them as a single bud in one ear and could not wear both and adjust the balance, which sacrificed and minimized the hearing in my good ear, just to get some form of minimal aid for the bad ear. These should be great for use during athletics.  Dunno about fidelity though, since I'm an audio snob with 7k in hd portable audio gear, and did not evaluate these as such.  Edit.......charged me 100 bucks to return........so a third of the total value of the purchase fee...buyer beware..."
13,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Beyond what I expected!,"I received my IQ Bud2 Max a couple of days ago and I was blown away. As a tile contractor I work in a loud environment with saws, grinders, vacuums, etc., so I have worn my Sony bluetooth headphones daily. They didn't cut the noise out, but made it more tolerable and are bulky. The hardest part of them was to communicate with coworkers, I would have to pull them down around my neck making my neck uncomfortable and difficult to turn my head. The first morning on the jobsite I put my IQ Bud2 Max's on my world changed! I did ed my music on and the clarity was great. I was woking with the noise canceling off as I cut a tile and as the decibel level was unbearable the buds turned the noise canceling on. That moment was life changing for me at work. I use them just as hearing aides, as I have hearing loss, the one touch control makes phone calls, and the shear compact fit is great. I'm not the most tech savvy person, but these are so easy to navigate. The charging case is great too. I know this might all sound staged, but this is just me wanting to share my experience so others can make a decision in their purchases or product inquiries. I still have more to learn about the app useage, but I'm excited to learn."
13,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"perfect for music, good as hearing aid for light hearing loss",Sound is great.Big in the ear and may fall out.Amplification may not be sufficient as a hearing aid.It is important to repeat the hearing test until optimal results are achieved.Noise cancellation is very good.Overall for the current price ($200) it is impressive.
13,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,ANC CAN BE BETTER,"A little disappointed with World off and ANC features. Can’t hardly tell the difference. Sent the unit back and bought another unit, and both seemed to have the same issues with World Off feature. Enhance hearing works on me , on the positive note."
13,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Great Buds but not hearing aids,"These are great sounding Ear-Buds and have a very useful app for adjusting sound, noise reduction, etc. Though THEY ARE NOT HEARING AIDS. I say this with caution because everything in the product description really made these Buds seem they could provide some hearing assistance. Unfortunately the integrated microphones and the supporting audio processing provides a very thin (tinty) sounding speech of worldly voices. If you tweek the app to EQ the incoming voices, you really only can reduce the thinness (tintyness) and that result is then to muddled (not clear in mid and high freq's) to understand worldly voices (speech). Bottom-line and unfortunately, these are Only just really nice ear-buds. Enjoy!"
13,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,these do not last,"I have gone through 2 pairs of these in 2 months. The first set stopped charging because for some reason this product still used micro USB. Micro USB alone warrants 1 star being taken off. It wasnt 2 weeks and I'm here wiggling the cord back and forth unable to tell when or if it was charging. Thankfully I returned that pair for another pair. Which worked great until one sweaty day, just over a month after I got them, the right bud began screeching and has not stopped yet. I can clap and change the tone of the screech. Bottom line, I love the concept, the app is a really nice touch. But you can not charge $500 a pop for a product that is not designed to last. Not using USB type-c should have been a dead giveaway. How much money did that save, on a $500 piece of plastic? Hopefully a couple of cents.I truly wish this was a 5-star review, but I am out $500 at this point. Did I mention they cost $500? Then break."
13,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointing,I can use them at the gym and listen to music and hear conversations at the same time.  Both are not very good..but it keeps me from having to pull a pod from my ear when a pretty young lady wants to chat
13,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Decent for indoor use,"The app is easy to use. They work decently well as hearing aids indoors, but don’t handle wind well. Sometimes they have streaming issues over Bluetooth. Noise cancellation is good enough, I use them as earplugs at work occasionally. Long term use is uncomfortable regardless of the bud inserts."
13,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good range of environmental settings,Bought mainly to enhance hearing in a noisy environment like restaurants but also good for watching catch up on devices. Still working on comfort/security of one bud. Must have a funny shaped ear!
13,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Works ok.,"I’m reviewing this on behalf of my husband who is the user. He still often can’t hear me. If the wind is blowing, the noise cancellation completely turns them off. There’s still room for lots of improvement."
13,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,Need an Iphone to Use These,"I couldn't figure out how to use these with my android phone, and you have to use a phone to set them up.  For me a waste of money, but my fault for not calling the manufacturer for help setting them up.Still, sure wish I could have made them work on my own, my hearing is pretty bad.  Just feel overwhelmed and befuddled by the set up procedure."
13,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Really helps me understand speech.,Nothing is ever perfect in a noisy environment but my IQBuds2 really help. And I'm able to hear the TV without turning the volume up. I've used these for almost 3 years and own two sets to extend battery time.
13,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,They work!,These buds are pretty  good. A little bit larger than blue tooth buds. I like that they look pretty low key and still work like any other blue tooth buds....phone music etc. These buds are tailored to your  hearing weak points and set them up for you. I'm a musician and have hard time with conversations and watching TV.  These help. Only minus is when it hooks to your phone its not always 100% connected so you can operate your EQ. My remedy is reboot Samsung S9+ and its cool! Overall a working product!
13,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Hearing enhacement,"Hearing enhance is poor, sound quality is normal, app not good, expensive."
13,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,,"Escucho mejor sin ellos y además molestan los ruidos como arrugar un papel, escribir en la computadora.Es decir, lo que no quiero escuchar lo escucho y lo que si quiero escuchar como las voces de las personas en una reunión no las escucho a pesar de hacer el test dos veces.No los recomiendo."
13,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Too complicated to use.  Could not hear my phone when watching tv,Could not hear my phone when watching tv
13,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Great for streaming, but not hearing aid.",Very good sound quality for music and phone but not enough amplification to serve as hearing aids for me. Returning this produce.
13,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Right Ear Bud dead out of the box,"Sound Quality was great however, the right earbud was deal upon arival.  I updated the firmware via the mobile app with no luck.  After looking into the app the right earbud didn't have a firmware version.  Not what i expected for $250 on sale."
13,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"WOW, more than I expected. Excellent","Charged the earbuds and downloaded the APP to my phone and paired. Note as far as I can tell these will not work without setting them up using the APP. The APP runs a full hearing test taking several minutes and requires a quiet environment. Upon completion it provides a graph of your hearing for each ear. This information is used by the app to customize and equalize each earbud to your hearing requirements. The equalization eliminates the need for a balance control, volume is also controlled in the app. After setup the set up  APP is no longer needed unless volume control needs adjusting. I have many hearing amplifying buds but they pale in comparison to these in performance. I am so impressed I'm thinking at this price I should buy a backup set just in case.Read a lot of somewhat negative reviews and still purchased due to to price and features, with this in mind my advice is if your unhappy with these buds find a teenager to help you set them up before returning.  Warning: I can now hear everything my wife say's and the clock on the wall."
13,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not good for hearing amplification,"As I bought Nuheara IQbuds 2 MAX for the hearing amplification my review ranking is with respect to that function. My conclusion is that the set I bought were not fit for purpose.I found that I could hear people better without the Buds than with them, i.e., people’s voices were louder when I removed the buds.I contacted Nuheara support who were very responsive and recommended trying multiple ear tips, recalculating the Ear ID each time. Sadly, regardless of ear tips used I could hear people better without the Buds than I could with them. I was unable to increase the volume of other people’s voices to an acceptable level.Nuheara support concluded that if they are not amplifying anything at all and they sound like ear plus in in my ear, it may be a fault and I may want to replace the set returning them to amazon for refund or replacement:AMAZON only offer a refund rather than a replacement, refunding only when the product is returned to them.I live in Singapore and my local post office would not accept ear Buds for shipment and referred me to UPS or any other courier service. I went to a UPS agent and was surprised that the cost to send these back to AMAZON was $115 Singapore Dollars. As that is approximately 34% of their purchase cost I didn’t feel that it was worth throwing more money at this and decided to keep the set for audio usage and with the Nuheara IQstream™ TV, which does work well."
13,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Did not perform well for me,"I tested the buds in various situations, being more interested in the quasi-hearing-aid function than in streaming. The sound did not seem very natural, in particular the sound of my own voice, but also other sounds. They did not help particularly in distinguishing speech such as dialogue on TV. I tried the noise reduction in the car, and found it not helpful. Direct testing of ANC versus no-ANC showed that the difference was barely perceptible. All that said, the product had many good features, and I found the Android app easy to work with. I wanted to like them, but they just didn't work for me. I returned them."
13,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Works well with hearing loss,"This is my third set of Nuheara ear buds. One of their first generation, and two of the current model, the IQbuds 2 MAX.My only complaint is not enough manual control, in the app. I would like to see balance control, or the ability to adjust L or R volume individually.One of the 1 star reviewers here complained that the buds were like earplugs, and they could hear better without them.I had the same experience, due to an incorrect setting.The instructions on the ear ID function are a little vague. After running the process, your instinct is to turn off the ear ID function.Ear ID must be left on, for the hearing boost (World function) to work. Tech support pointed this out.Once they are set up properly, these earbuds work very well."
13,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,I must have a different pair of earbuds to the other reviewers...,"After reading some of the reviews on Amazon.com regarding these ear buds I was hesitant regarding how good they would be.  I have mild high freqency hearing loss and was finding hearing aids both poor for listening to music / audio via Bluetooth on the phone and also for phone calls.  Also being 50 I wasn't that comfortable with an on-the-ear device and was interested in hearables.My situation is primarily about improving the quality of the sound I hear when watching TV in the evenings and also for listening to music during the day.  I work from home and so I was OK with the comparatively short battery life that others have mentioned.  First impressions was that these ear buds were quite large and also a bit uncomfortable, but after a week or so I have gotten used to the feel.  The EarID app is very good and tweaks the sound to adjust for any hearing loss you might have (so long as it is mild hearing loss).  It only works with ""WORLD ON"".It did take me a few days to play around with all the settings to avoid feedback / hiss / etc but I think now I have adjusted them in a way that provides pretty good performance.  I particularly like the way you can programme the touch sensitive sides - at the moment I'm keeping it simple with left one touch as stop / start music and the right ear as WORLD on/off.  I might introduce some more options as I get more used to using the earbuds.The noise cancelling is extremely good - though you do lose the EarID customisation.  I think it would be amazing on a flight but even just working at home it's great to cancel out any background noise.  The sound quality is amazing too - I'm hearing music in a different way to when I was using my Sennheiser HD25 over-the-ear headphones.Nothing is a panacea and I think if you view these as really decent ear-buds with fantastic sound, noise cancelling and the ability to improve the range of sounds you hear on radio / TV you will be very impressed.  I have also bought the Nuheara IQ TVStream and that's fantastic - you can have the TV running at a volume that others are comfortable with and then use the earbuds personally so you can properly hear the dialogue.  I'm watching the second series of the Bear and after the muddy dialogue of the first few episodes actually being able to understand every word that's spoken on the show is fantastic.For the price I paid on amazon.com I am very satisfied - marginally more than airpod pros but as an Android user I didn't have the option of getting the hearables functionality.Also to add - these are manufactured in Malaysia, not China."
13,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,I wanted to like IQ Buds,"The Buds overall are very disappointing. Simply put, they do not give you quality hearing.After experimenting with several end tips, I still cannot get a decent fit; they extend well beyond the ear.The buds will squeal if not perfectly inserted causing the user to adjust often. I am constantly adjustingthe fits and the sound.The sound……If I am watching TV and my partner is eating peanuts on a sofa close by, I will hearing the crunchingreally well but not the TV. In addition, I cannot hear that same person talking to me.If a glass in placed on a coffee table, the sound is similar to placing a tin can on the table. Tinny.The sound is not amplified properly, the two ears do not work well together.If a TV programs has a siren noise (louder), the effect is almost shocking and disconcerting.I hear my voice and little else. These buds would be an embarrassment if worn outside the home.I cannot adjust the app’s ‘focus’ to suit my hearing needs.I cannot hear the dog barking to come inside; no amplification where and when it is needed.Charging…..It seems the buds very quickly need charging. Twice in one evening is my experience.I cannot find one positive thing to say about this product. I will not recommend anyone purchase thisproduct. I am sorry I did."
13,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not returnable to Amazon once used,The hearing evaluation that is used to control how these work cranked up the high frequencies too much.  Attempting to moderate that through the bluetooth-connected phone app was inadequate.  I can still understand speech in most environments better *without* these devices.Also found that chewing sounds were greatly amplified (so can't use at meal-times); and they are so heavy that they tend to pop out when active - even just walking fast was problematic.These were an expensive and failed experiment!
13,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nuheara IQbuds² MAX vs. Apple AirPods,"I have been using my Nuheara IQbuds² MAX earbuds for over a week now and I am very impressed, especially compared to my Apple AirPods (and my loyalty to Apple devices).The sound quality of the Nuheara IQbuds² MAX earbuds compared to my AirPods is very impressive. I do not have to amplify the volume on these earbuds as loud and they sound much clearer.I love how securely the IQbuds² MAX earbuds fit in my ear. They are very comfortable to wear and are sleek in appearance – they don’t feel or look like they are “hanging out of my ears”. They stay in my ears even when I am working out and I never have to push them back into my ear.I love how I can adjust the level of “outside noise” through the Nuheara companion app on my iPhone. It is so incredibly helpful to have different settings to fit the occasion. When I am at the gym, I want to be able to hear my surroundings to an extent, but not so much that the noises of the machines and other people impact the quality of my music listening experience. I found that being able to adjust the settings allows me to control that balance perfectly. With my AirPods, I had to completely take one of the earbuds out of my ear to be able to hear when someone came up to me.The noise cancelation function is another great feature – especially for travel or whenever I want to tune out the world around me. For years, I loved using my Bose over-the-ear headphones with noise cancellation for air travel. However, they were too bulky to travel with. Though I have not yet worn my Nuheara earbuds on a flight, I can imagine that their compact size and noise cancellation will make them a more comfortable solution when wearing them with a neck pillow and will be easy to carry versus the hassle of carrying big, bulky headphones.As a female, I feel much safer wearing the IQbuds² MAX earbuds while walking because I can adjust how much outside noise I take in. I get worried about walking with headphones because they suppress my awareness of my surroundings. However, with these earbuds I can still hear surrounding noises while still listening to my music. This is a very important feature for me.Overall, I love my Nuheara IQbuds² MAX earbuds! They produce high-quality sound, look sleek, and are comfortable, and I love the adjustable noise cancellation and using the Nuheara companion app on my iPhone. I am happy to have made the switch from my AirPods to the Nuheara IQbuds² MAX earbuds!"
13,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good for mild hearing loss, excellent for streaming","I have mild to mid high frequency hearing loss and bought these ear buds as backup / add-on of my simple professional hearing aids. First impression was that these ear buds were quite large and I wear them mainly at home. Fitting to my ears was easy using enclosed adapters. Set-up of ear-ID was no problem. After some tweaking I was able to get satisfying settings for speech recognition of persons and also for speakers of TV, receiver, etc. When high volume is set, I have to filter out high frequencies to avoid hiss. Until now I did not test location settings extensive and therefore, I cannot comment on it. My impression for situations where ear bud’s microphones are in operation the sound quality is satisfying, but not excellent. On the other hand, for streaming from mobile phone, from TV via connector, etc., the hearing experience is excellent."
13,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for people with audio processing issues,"I have now had these earbuds for about a year, and I really like them. I do not have hearing loss issues, but I do get overwhelmed by too much noise, and have a lot of trouble distinguishing voices in noisy areas, and these buds have delivered on fixing those two problems for me. I take them into every restaurant, bar, arcade, or family gathering and they are a life saver. I used to be so frustrated I couldn't understand the conversations around me, or in really noisy places like arcades I would just shut down after 15 minutes, but now I am able to tolerate them much better! I don't know that these would help as much with hearing _loss_, but they definitely have helped me with being able to hear better in noisy places. As others have mentioned, the ANC is nothing to write home about. Better than nothing, but I'm giving these 5 stars because I got them specification help with audio processing disorder, which they have done very well. Because I use them in specific settings and not all day every day, I have found the batter and recharging a non issue, they last for ages!The sound of voices is a little strange, definitely not ""natural"" but I got used to it very quickly and have had no issues with it. It can be hard to tell how loud I am with them in, because I always feel like I'm much louder than I actually am with them in, though."

13,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fantastic,"The IQbuds are very good! I’ve tried most other buds… these beat them easily. Just follow the guided setup hearing test to customize your hearing experience. Takes about five minutes to do. The program then matches your optimal sounds (mid, high,lows) to your hearing. I m really surprised and pleased."
13,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for background noise cancalation,The IQbuds max are great for background noise removal in malls and on the street.  They also make watchin movies on a plane a great experience.
13,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great customer service,"I have some tinnitus and it is difficult for me to hear people talking in a crowd or when there is a lot of background noise.  I read some great things about these ear buds and was anxious to see if they would help me.The first set I bought were defective and stopped working after a couple days.  Oh well, it happens.  But after a few days of troubleshooting back and forth with their email support, they still were not working and their suggestions weren't really helping.  At that point, I was a bit frustrated in the lack of progress and was prepared to chalk them off and just return them.  I expressed my frustration with them and the company then offered to send me a new pair and overnighted them to me.  I've now been using the replacement pair for a few days and they've been great!  Although not hearing aids, they do enhance and amplify the ""gaps"" in my hearing.  I find it easier to hear people and even little things I was missing before.  Great product and better company.Now that's how you take care of your customers!  100% recommend."
13,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Helps me hear conversations and I can also silence the world.,I work in a loud industrial environment. Works great Comfortable all day. Helps me hear people talking to me as I have poor hearing. The noise canceling is great.  Can make the entire world go silent or go loud.  Can stream music or telephone calls  while choosing how much of the outside world is being heard.  Generally I like listening to music in silence but sometimes my boss is talking to me so I can touch the side and turn him up while continuing to play my music.  Unfortunately the IQBuds 2 Max cannot fix his endless babbling and nonsense.
13,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Sound and easy to use,"The sound is great and they are easy to use.Battery keeps its charge longer than any other earbuds that I have used over the years.Able to use these with IPhone, TV, Computer and works great for Zoom calls."
13,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Cool product,They work but if you have hearing lose in only one ear you can't adjust just the one ear. They are big too. They just weren't what I expected.

I need help and can’t get it.Thanks,Bill"
140,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,This really works.,This really works.  For the price I think it is wonderfull.  One of them stopped working but there has been no problem returning it to get a replacement.  They only required a tracking number to immediately send the replacement.  I am very pleased with this.  We did not have to wait for them to receive it or test it in order to get it in the mail.Like all hearing devices the person using it is the key to how well it works.  Like everything in life you must put in the effort.  If you do that wit this device you will be well pleased!

140,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Don't expect the quality of the ones you pay thousands for.,The numbers wore off the volume Dile. I use them always if watching TV with my wife. Or around people.  I spent years with guns going off and things blowing up. I am 77 and would do it again using a walker.

140,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Hearing Help,These hearing aids have greatly improved my hearing.
140,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Affordable Hearing Amplifier.,Bought these for my dad. Seem to work ok.Some difficulty inserting them. If you turn them on before inserting prepare yourself for a feedback screech. Really anoying.
140,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,Yet another failure,"I admit, purchasing hearing aids without a doctor's review is a crapshoot. But with my elderly mom bedridden and unable to visit a doctor, I took the chance. It was useless. Like other hearing aids I tried in the past for my dad, if you keep it low they don't amplify anything, and if you go up to 3 or higher they make a piercing feedback noise that's worse than not hearing a thing.On the plus side, I returned them and got my money back without any hassle."
140,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Prompt Response by Seller,"Our 101 year old mother is doing very well with these hearing aids.  The previous hearing aids purchased from a big box store was much more expensive and not nearly as effective as these.  When we encountered a problem with one of the hearing aids, the Seller promptly offered to replace it.  We later learned that replacing the sound tube solved the problem.  We are happy with this purchase."
140,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,Missing required items.,"My 93 year old mother was excited to receive the product. However, there were no instructions with the product and someone had opened the package the charger was in and removed the charger therefore we did not receive a charge with the device. It must have been a returned item and someone had removed and kept the charger. So we do not know it the product works or not since we have no way to charge the hearing aids."
140,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Hearing aid failed,One of my hearing aids failed.  I called the company and within days they had determined that the hearing aid was defective and replaced it.  I am most satisfied with this service and want to give a special mention to Celia who served me.  This representative really wanted to help and did her utmost to solve the problem.  Thankyou.
140,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,Work great when they work properly,My dad purchased these through my Amazon account. They worked as well as the expensive brands for about two months. And now the one has to be constantly adjusted because the volume never stays consistent. The other one works perfectly. He's about at the point of smashing it. The instructions say to call the number for help but there's no phone number listed. If it wasn't for the volume issue I'd give it a 5 star review.

140,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Updated,I am updating my review. I had purchased a pair for my mom that came used.

I was so amazed that within a month or so, I ordered this pair. I did not have any idea my hearing was bad in both ears.Finding this set has enlightened me. Who knew there were so many sounds I was missing out on. I was astounded.But now, I am happy and hearing birds, cars from a mile away, things I had forgotten about.And no one yells at me to turn the TV down.Not too long ago, I broke my charger. I contacted the service department and they put me in contact with their sales department for a replacement.  After being able to hear, I can't wait to get my new charger so I can go back to hearing in both ears!"

I have some trouble adjusting them as I still have to learn about them.  Everything seems to be OK.  I do not have to turn my TV up as high as before and I now hear some things I did not hear previously.  They fit just fine - a times, I do not even know that I am wearing them.  But because i am still learning about them, I do still adjust them at times."
140,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,sound is good,Hearing aids are a good product and at a fair price.
140,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,Volume control on both has quit working.,After the volume quit working on both aids and we were snowbirds in FL. I put them away. I decided to try them again today months later but the volume controls still fails. I would never suggest someone pay $400 for these as I did.
140,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Vivtone Pro 20: A REAL Hearing Aid that actually works as advertised.,"*  I have tried FOUR other (cheap hearing aids $50, $80, $150, $300, but NONE of these worked for me.(Maybe you get what you pay for?).*  I like the BTE (Behind The Ear) MUCH better than the RIC (Receiver In Canal) types that I tried.  The RIC types DO get lost and CAN fall out.  Plus the RIC types are much more prone to feedback (whisteling).*  I am KEEPING this pair (Vivtone Pro 20) as they are the BEST Hearing Aid I have tried in a lengthy search.  JCG 03/12/2023I LIKED:*  GOOD VALUE: for the price ($400) - it DOES what the manufacturer claims.  Works outside (noisy), inside (quiet), in the congregation (music, loud conversations), on my cell phone, and at work (telephone, conversations, equipment, etc.).NOISE CANCELLING: I use MODE 2 for everything.  (I tried the other three modes but the difference between them is small.)  I can now understand when people talk to me in noisy environments AND sing along with the music.  Programs are EASY to change.* TO CHARGE: Base MUST be plugged in to ANY USB source (5VDC) (laptop, phone., wall adapter, etc.).  Comes with Charging base, USB Adapter and charging cable.*  BATTERY CAPACITY: Li-ION RE-CHARGEABLE batteries last (at least) 20 hours in all situatiions (above), at volume 2.0 to 2.5.  Turn off when not in use to keep battery up.*  VOLUME CONTROL:  is fully eaily adjustable from 1-4.  Audio quality is GOOD (but not great).*  FIT / COMFORT: is good (tall guys like me need ""long"" pipes).  These are free, once you register.  Be sure you TRY the different ear-domes until you find the pair that fit YOU best.  This fitting process is trial-and-error and took me 4 days to be REALLY happy with my choice.*  NO BLUETOOTH.  This is a GOOD thing.  Bluetooth messed up the performance of some of the other brands I tried.  (I left reviews on these as well).  If you want private music or TV, take out one (or both) Hearing Aids and put in your ear-buds.*  FALLING OUT / COMFORT:  I never dropped or lost mine in 4 days of testing.  They do NOT catch on masks or clothing.  Once I learned how to use the tensioning bar they are even more secure.  After a brief adjustment period, you do not even know you have them on.*  EYEGLASSES: take just a bit of getting used to since they share the space above your ear with the Hearing Aid, but I had NO problems adjusting.*  GOOD DOCUMENTATION: printed manuals are good.  PDF (electronic versions) are readily available on their (secure) website  (https://vivtone.com/).DON'T LIKE:*  NO SECONDARY BATTERY  in CHARGING BASE (like some other brands), so you need to charge ONCE per DAY.  (This is MINOR since you CAN charge from ANYTHING (USB) IF you have the CHARGING BASE and cable with you.*  VOLUME CONTROL is easy to bump while putting on.  (But it is easy to adjust back afterwards.)  Minor.*  LEFT and RIGHT are determined by the Ear-Pipes, NOT the hearing aid (which is NOT labeled).  My sharpie fixed that.  Minor.*  LED's: Are REALLY BRIGHT (at night) and NEVER go out while in the charging base.  (Either cover up, or unplug when they go green.  Minor* As you can see I have NO major complaints at all."
140,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good value but don't forget to dehumidify- First time users may not be aware of this,Units perform as advertised and are comfortable.  I had an issue with humidity causing limited volume on the right ear after 16 days of use.  After drying the device started working again.  I live in a cold humid climate  (Eastern US) and found that this is a common problem for many hearing aid manufacturers. Get a simple dehumidifier jar for your hearing aids on Amazon for $10 and keep your hearing aids healthy.
140,Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Quality of sound is very low, non-existent",Better hearing.
140,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"A Pleased Great, Great Nana!","Prior to purchasing Vivtone’s Hearing Amplifier, my 96 year old mom had purchased a similar pair at three times the cost at a big box store. (Her old pair serviced her well for almost five years). When one stopped working we sought to replace them but were told she would have to be re examined by their audiologist. At this point in time she was living over 200 miles from the store and at her advanced age the trip was prohibitive. She was quite dismayed not being able to hear her caregivers and visiting family. Out of desperation I went online seeking alternatives and was quite pleased to learn that changes in the law now allowed companies like Vivtone to sell direct to the hard of hearing without their having to go through a third entity for an audiology test. When the Vivtone hearing amplifier arrived they were nearly invisible in her ears and were aesthetically pleasing. It was difficult to discern she was wearing a hearing device and the technology seemed to work as well and very similar to her previous pair. The best part; she could again hear us! The pair arrived packaged professionally and being rechargeable were easier for my mom to handle, as she no longer needed to change minuscule batteries that were hard to see and manipulate. Our family highly recommends Vivtone’s hearing amplifiers. Our mom hears just as well at one-third the previous hearing aid cost.  Thank you!"
140,Amazon,3.0 out of 5 stars,One of the units doesn't work,"When I purchased this model number, the unit intended for the right ear worked for a few days, then stopped holding a charge.  After 2 to 3 hours, that unit stopped transmitting.  Even after recharging, the sound was faint at best.I purchased the Asurion protection plan, but so far have not receive a satisfactory resolution to this problem.I have traded e-mails with the manufacturer, who is trying to resolve the problem.  So far I have only 1 working earpiece, but the manufacturer is making a good faith attempt to send me a second unit that will work properly.I will update this review once the problem has been resolved."
140,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,You don't need to spend thousands to enjoy better hearing again.,"I liked the small size, fidelity and ease of operation.  But particularly, I liked that I didn't have to spend a small fortune to ultimately replace my Widex 330 hearing aids that died after 3 years, 4 months - original cost was $4,300.  I had purchased other OTC hearing aids but was very dissatisfied with the serious lack of quality regardless of the flowery descriptions provided by the sellers.  My audiologist had been recommending hearing aids costing $6,340, or, $6,550 - my choice. (Wow).  To say I'm thrilled with the quality of the Vivtone Pro20's I now am using is an absolute understatement!!!"
140,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,Being able to hear clearly,Just got these & wearing for first time today. I’m still adjusting to them with sound control etc. One thing I don’t like is the plastic piece hanging down in front of my ear. Why is that there? Anyone else have issues with that piece hanging down?
140,Amazon,5.0 out of 5 stars,They work,They seem to work in all venues that I have used them..
140,Amazon,4.0 out of 5 stars,trying to hear better at a managable price,"easy to use, so far so good, charged it up, into my ears, and could hear the tv and my wifehope it passes the test of time"

25,Amazon,2.0 out of 5 stars,Read the review!,"Brought 02/20/23My last hearing aids were behind the ear. They work really well and lasted 10 years. However, they cost over $2,000 apiece. So, I brought Lucid Enrich Pro, that was a mistake. Lucid hearing aid work well in a quit setting. Such as watching TV. These hearing aids did increase volume. These hearings aids are more like an amplifier than a hearing aid. I mean they increase the volume of everything. For example, when driving the road noise is so loud you can't hear the radio, Another, problem is the quality. My left hearing aid failed late February. Lucid replaced it with no problem. In fact, they sent me a new set. That was smart because my right hearing aid just failed. Another issue are the hearing tubes. If you remove the tubes from the devise a few times the tubes hole at the attachment point get out of round and they won't fit securely to the base. They will come off and the base falls away from your ear this happened to me luckily, I was in my truck; so, I didn't lose it. These are the reasons I gave it 2 stars."
